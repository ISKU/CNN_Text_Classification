      "OBJECTIVES\n",
      "To investigate predictors of continence outcomes after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.\n",
      "METHODS\n",
      "Clinical records of 272 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were investigated. Preoperative Overactive Bladder Symptom Score, International Prostate Symptom Score and clinicopathological factors were investigated, and relationships between factors and recovery of continence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were assessed. The presence of overactive bladder was defined as having urgency for more than once a week and having ≥3 points according to the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "Age (≤66 years) was significantly associated with continence within 6 months after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (P = 0.033). The absence of overactive bladder and lower Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (<3) were significantly associated with recovery of continence within 12 months after surgery (both variables P = 0.009). In terms of achieving recovery of continence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, Kaplan-Meier curves showed earlier recovery in \"age ≤66 years,\" \"prostate weight ≤40 g\" and \"overactive bladder symptom score <3\" (P = 0.0072, 0.0172 and 0.0140, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of overactive bladder was an independent negative predictor for recovery of continence within 12 months after surgery (P = 0.019).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "The presence of baseline overactive bladder seems to represent an independent negative predictor for recovery of continence at 12 months after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.\n",

      "IMPORTANCE\n",
      "This novel endpoint tracks functional vision changes in patients with inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) over time.\n",
      "BACKGROUND\n",
      "Determine whether a multi-luminance mobility test (MLMT) can detect functional vision changes over time in subjects with IRDs, to assess natural history and potential effects of investigational agents.\n",
      "DESIGN\n",
      "Prospective, observational study.\n",
      "PARTICIPANTS\n",
      "Sixty-two subjects were enrolled. Sixty (29 normal-sighted, 31 visually impaired) were eligible; 54 (28 visually impaired, 26 normal-sighted) completed all testing visits.\n",
      "METHODS\n",
      "Subjects navigated MLMT courses 3 times over 1 year. At each visit, subjects completed testing using individual eyes, and both eyes, at up to 9 standardized, increasing luminance levels (range 1 to 400 lux). Accuracy and speed were evaluated and compared with visual acuity (VA), visual field (VF), and a visual function questionnaire.\n",
      "MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\n",
      "Accuracy and speed of normal and visually impaired subjects on MLMT; and reliability and content validity of MLMT.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "MLMT distinguished normal-sighted from visually impaired subjects. All control subjects passed all MLMT attempts at all tested light levels. Visually impaired subjects' performance varied widely; some declined over 1 year. Performance declined markedly below certain VA and VF thresholds. Concordance on performance on two baseline visits was high: correlations for accuracy were 94% and 98% for lowest common and highest common lux levels.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\n",
      "MLMT differentiated visually impaired from control populations, and, in visually impaired subjects, identified a range of performances, and tracked performance declines over time, consistent with these progressive conditions.\n",

      "OBJECTIVES\n",
      "To better predict operative time using patient/surgical characteristics among men undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy or robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy in order to achieve more efficient operative scheduling and potentially decrease costs in the Veterans Health System.\n",
      "METHODS\n",
      "We analyzed 2619 men treated with radical retropubic prostatectomy (n = 2005) or robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (n = 614) from 1993 to 2013 from six Veterans Affairs Hospitals in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database. Age, body mass index, race, biopsy Gleason, prostate weight, undergoing a nerve-sparing procedure or lymph node dissection, and hospital surgical volume were analyzed in multivariable linear regression to identify predictors of operative time and to quantify the increase/decrease observed.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "In men undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy, body mass index, black race, prostate weight and a lymph node dissection all predicted longer operative times (all P ≤ 0.004). In men undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, biopsy Gleason score and a lymph node dissection were associated with increased operative time (P ≤ 0.048). In both surgical methods, a lymph node dissection added 25-40 min to the operation. Also, in both, each additional operation per year per center predicted a 0.80-0.89-min decrease in operative time (P ≤ 0.001).\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "Overall, several factors seem to be associated with quantifiable changes in operative time. If confirmed in future studies, these findings can allow for a more precise estimate of operative time, which could decrease the overall cost to the patient and hospital by aiding in operating room time management.\n",

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "Urethral strictures generate great morbidity. Two procedures have been described for their management - laser and cold knife techniques - which are still widely used. We aim to assess the safety and efficacy of laser versus cold knife urethrotomy.\n",
      "MATERIALS AND METHODS\n",
      "We conducted a systematic search of the literature using MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and Cochrane databases and gray literature. Primary outcomes were urethral stricture recurrence, time-to-recurrence and complication rate. Secondary outcomes were quality of life and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax). Data analysis was obtained using Review Manager 5.2.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "Out of 137 publications, 4 articles were included in the meta-analysis. At 3 months, the recurrence rate was similar in both groups (0.55, 95% CI 0.18-1.66), but at 6 and 12 months, it was significantly lower in the laser urethrotomy group (0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.81 and 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.75). The analysis of Qmax at 6 months post-intervention suggested a greater improvement in the laser urethrotomy group. A qualitative analysis showed that complications in both procedures were minor and infrequent.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "Laser urethrotomy has a lower recurrence rate at 6 and 12 months compared to cold knife urethrotomy. Complications in both procedures are minor and infrequent. Results should be interpreted cautiously, since they were evaluated only for a short term.\n",

      "OBJECTIVE\n",
      "Two methods using exercise and body cooling could influence the well-being of patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). The aim of this study was to determine whether wearing a cooling vest during a physical training program could increase the cognitive and physical capacities and quality of life in PwMS.\n",
      "METHODS\n",
      "Eighteen PwMS (49.6 ± 8 years; Expanded Disability Status Score 5.0 ± 1.0) were randomly assigned to a cooling or control group. PwMS underwent a 7-week physical training program. In the cooling group, PwMS wore a cooling vest during each training session, whereas in the control group, PwMS wore a cotton T-shirt. Before and after the training program, both groups completed the Isaacs Set Test (IST), Trail Making Test A-B (TMT A-B), SEP-59, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory and performed a 6-minute walk test (6MWT).\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "The cooling group showed significantly (p < 0.05) improved performance for IST, TMT A and 6MWT. Their emotional well-being and cognitive functions investigated in SEP-59 were significantly (p < 0.05) improved, and general and physical fatigue significantly (p < 0.05) decreased.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "This physical training program combined with a cooling strategy could have a significant positive influence on both cognitive and physical performances, perceived fatigue and emotional well-being in heat-sensitive PwMS.\n",

      "AIM\n",
      "To assess the relationship between severity of small for gestational age (SGA) and the risk of poor school performance, and to investigate whether adult stature modifies this risk.\n",
      "METHODS\n",
      "1,088,980 Swedish children born at term between 1973 and 1988 were categorized into severe SGA (less than -3 standard deviations (SD) of expected birth weight), moderate SGA (-2.01 to -3 SD), mild SGA (-1.01 to -2 SD), and appropriate for gestational age (-1 to 0.99 SD). The risk of poor school performance at the time of graduation from compulsory school (grades <10th percentile) was calculated using unconditional logistic regression models and adjusted for socio-economic factors. In a sub-analysis, we stratified boys by adult stature, and adjusted for maternal but not paternal height.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "All SGA groups were significantly associated with an increased risk of poor school performance, with adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals ranging from 1.85 (1.65-2.07) for severe SGA to 1.25 (1.22-1.28) for mild SGA. In the sub-analysis, all birth weight groups were associated with an increased risk of poor school performance among boys with short stature compared to those with non-short stature.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "Mild SGA is associated with a significantly increased risk of poor school performance, and the risk increases with severity of SGA. Further, this risk diminishes after adequate catch-up growth.\n",

      "BACKGROUND/AIMS\n",
      "The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of Cx43- and Smad-mediated TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway on the differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) into cartilage and inhibition of ossification.\n",
      "METHODS\n",
      "BMSCs of Wistar rats were cultured and assigned into 5 groups for transfection with adenoviruses. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were employed to detect mRNA and protein expressions of target genes. The condition of cartilage and ossification were measured by a series of staining methods. Subcutaneous injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into nude rats was performed.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "After transfection, compared to the AdGFP group, the corresponding target mRNAs were overexpressed in the AdBMP2, AdSmad1, AdCx43 + AdSmad1 and AdCx43 + AdSmad1 + AdBMP2 groups, and overexpression of BMP2 at the mRNA and protein expression was observed in the AdSmad1 and AdCx43 + AdSmad1 groups. The mRNA expressions of aggrecan (ACAN) and collagen type II alpha 1 (Col2a1), the glycosaminoglycan content of the extracellular matrix and the expression of type II collagen, Col2a1, osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OC) were higher in the AdBMP2, AdSmad1, AdCx43 + AdSmad1 and AdCx43 + AdSmad1 + AdBMP2 groups than in the AdGFP group; alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mRNA and protein expressions of Runx2 were also higher in these groups than in the AdGFP group. Heterotopic osteogenesis tests demonstrated evident cartilage differentiation ability in the AdCx43 + AdSmad1 + AdBMP2 groups. In comparison, the AdCx43 + AdSmad1 and AdSmad1 groups exhibited weaker cartilage differentiation abilities.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "Cx43 and Smad1 promote BMP-induced cartilage differentiation of BMSCs and inhibit osteoblast differentiation, which provide a new strategy for cartilage tissue engineering using exogenous Cx43 and Smad1.\n",

      "METHODS\n",
      "We performed a retrospective cohort study of pregnant women with active CMV infection referred to our unit over a 15-year period (January 2000 to December 2014). Non-primary infection was diagnosed on the basis of the results of confirmatory serological and virological tests (avidity test, immunoblotting, real-time PCR-DNA). The vertical transmission rate and the percentage of symptomatic congenital infection were determined in this group of patients.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "A total of 205 pregnant women were enrolled. Congenital infection occurred in 7 (3.4%) fetuses/neonates. Symptomatic disease was present at birth in 3 of the 7 congenitally infected neonates (1.5%). Two out of 3 symptomatic newborns presented a pathologic second-trimester ultrasound scan.\n",

      "METHODS\n",
      "Serum levels of cytokines IL-18, IL-12 and TNF-α, bile acids and hepatic function parameters were measured. The expression of HDAC3 in the placenta was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting and RT-PCR.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "IL-18, IL-12 and TNF-α serum levels were significantly higher in the severe ICP group than in the mild ICP group and the control group, and the difference between the mild ICP group and control group was not significant. HDAC3 protein expression was identified in the nucleus of the placental trophoblast by IHC. HDAC3 mRNA and protein expression were significantly lower in the ICP groups (mild ICP and severe ICP groups) than in the control groups, and no significant difference was found between the mild ICP and severe ICP groups.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "The low expression of HDAC3 and overexpession of inflammatory cytokines (IL-18, IL-12 and TNF-α) in ICP may be involved in liver cell apoptosis. We suspect that HDAC3 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of ICP.\n",

      "In this prospective, open-label, single-arm multicenter clinical trial, treatment-naïve PCV patients received IVA (2.0 mg) every 2 months, after 3 initial monthly doses. The primary endpoint assessed was the proportion of patients maintaining baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 1 year.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "Fifty eyes with PCV were included in the study. BCVA was maintained or improved in 97.6% of the patients. Mean logMAR BCVA at baseline was 0.33, and had improved to 0.12 logMAR 1 year after the initiation of aflibercept treatment (p < 0.001). Mean central foveal thickness decreased from 356 to 239 μm (p < 0.001). Complete regression of polypoidal lesions was seen in 72.5% after 1 year of treatment.\n",

      "Spatially resolved functional assessment of rods and cones under photopic and scotopic conditions is desirable to evaluate the treatment outcome of gene therapeutic applications in inherited retinal disorders, such as early- onset severe retinal dystrophy (EOSRD) or achromatopsia.\n",
      "METHODS\n",
      "A sample of 3 healthy subjects, 6 patients with RPE65 deficiency (aged 11-45 years), and 3 patients with cone dysfunction disorders underwent spectral sensitivity testing (SST) under conditions of dark and light adaptation using a Humphrey Field Analyzer modified perimeter.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "SST in healthy subjects revealed sensitivity curves corresponding well with the CIE (International Commission on Illumination) standard fundamentals. Absence of cone function was observed in patients with cone dysfunction disorders. In patients with RPE65 mutations, SST under conditions of both dark and light adaptation revealed similar curves at typical cone sensitivities. S cone-related thresholds were diminished in young patients (11-14 years) and absent in adults (19 years and over).\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "In the present study, residual vision was cone mediated both under photopic and scotopic conditions in young patients with EOSRD associated with RPE65 mutations, but S cone function was severely reduced early on. In rod monochromats, vision was rod mediated both under conditions of dark and light adaptation. These observations are important for ongoing and future clinical trials employing gene therapeutic strategies in both rod-cone dystrophies and achromatopsia.\n",

Ionized sodium, ionized potassium and ionized chloride were determined by direct potentiometry, as recommended by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry. Bicarbonate was calculated from pH and carbon dioxide pressure.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "Electrolyte or acid-base abnormalities were disclosed in 59 (74%) of the 80 infants: hyponatremia (n = 54), hypobicarbonatemia (n = 18), hyperkalemia (n = 14), hyperbicarbonatemia (n = 6), hypochloremia (n = 3), hypokalemia (n = 3), and hyperchloremia (n = 1). None of the patients was found to be hypernatremic. Patients with and without electrolyte or acid-base abnormalities did not differ with respect to age, sex distribution, and whole blood glucose. Blood tonicity was lower and poor fluid intake, frequent regurgitations or loose stools more common among infants with electrolyte or acid-base abnormalities.\n",

      "The prognostic impact of circumferential resection margin (CRM) involvement in resected esophageal cancer (EC) is controversial discussed. The College of American Pathologists (CAP) and the Royal College of Pathologists (RCP) provide 2 different definitions of CRM involvement. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the clinical significance of CRM involvement on patients' survival following esophagectomy due to EC.\n",
      "METHODS\n",
      "PubMed, Science Direct, and Google scholar were searched for studies analyzing the clinical impact of CRM in EC.\n",
      "SUMMARY\n",
      "A total of 28 studies analyzed the prognostic effect of a positive CRM in EC. A wide range of CRM involvement (8.6-83.1%) was reported. Both available meta-analyses found a significant association between a positive CRM and patients' survival irrespective of RCP (OR 2.52 [95% CI 1.96-3.25; p < 0.001]) or CAP (OR 4.02 [95% CI 2.25-7.20; p < 0.001]) criteria. The influence of neoadjuvant therapy on the CRM remains unclear. Key Messages: CRM involvement is a useful parameter for EC patients' prognosis. The application of CAP criteria should be preferred since patients with a poor prognosis can be identified more sufficiently. Neoadjuvant therapy and en bloc transthoracic esophagectomy show favorable results for achievement of negative CRM.\n",
