      "Abstract: This prospective observational study explored the association of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and small-for-gestational age (SGA) with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as determined by screening measures for OSA and sleep studies.Two symptom-based screening questionnaires, the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), were administered to enroll 1509 gravidae. Screen positive subjects were referred for polysomnography (PSG). The primary outcome was the occurrence of either gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. [a1]Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to estimate the relative risks of associations.1157 subjects were available for outcomes analysis. Screening positive on the BQ was positively associated with hypertensive disorders in GLM models (aRR=1.90, 95%CI 1.52–2.37).In this large prospective trial, GLM modeling suggest that the BQ but not the ESS demonstrated significant association with measured adverse pregnancy outcomes, and specific items predicted these outcomes better than others.

We used standard formulae incorporating prevalence of combined OCP use in the Australian population, relative risks of cancer associated with this exposure and cancer incidence.An estimated 105 breast and 52 cervical cancers (0.7% and 6.4% of each cancer, respectively) in Australia in 2010 were attributable to current use of combined OCP. Past combined OCP use was estimated to have prevented 1,032 endometrial and 308 ovarian cancers in 2010, reducing the number of cancers that would otherwise have occurred by 31% and 19%, respectively.A small proportion of breast and cervical cancers is attributable to combined OCP use; OCP use is likely to have prevented larger numbers of endometrial and ovarian cancers.Women seeking contraceptive advice should be told of potential adverse effects, but should also be told that – along with reproductive health benefits – combined OCP use can reduce long-term risks of ovarian and endometrial cancers.\n",

Screen positive subjects were referred for polysomnography (PSG). The primary outcome was the occurrence of either gestational hypertension or preeclampsia. [a1]Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to estimate the relative risks of associations.1157 subjects were available for outcomes analysis. Screening positive on the BQ was positively associated with hypertensive disorders in GLM models (aRR=1.90, 95%CI 1.52–2.37).In this large prospective trial, GLM modeling suggest that the BQ but not the ESS demonstrated significant association with measured adverse pregnancy outcomes, and specific items predicted these outcomes better than others. However, causative association of BQ with OSA cannot be assumed.To estimate the proportion and number of cancers occurring in Australia in 2010 attributable to combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use.We estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) for cancers causally associated with combined OCP use (breast, cervix), and the proportion of endometrial and ovarian cancers prevented (prevented fraction [PF]). We used standard formulae incorporating prevalence of combined OCP use in the Australian population, relative risks of cancer associated with this exposure and cancer incidence.An estimated 105 breast and 52 cervical cancers (0.7% and 6.4% of each cancer, respectively) in Australia in 2010 were attributable to current use of combined OCP. Past combined OCP use was estimated to have prevented 1,032 endometrial and 308 ovarian cancers in 2010, reducing the number of cancers that would otherwise have occurred by 31% and 19%, respectively.A small proportion of breast and cervical cancers is attributable to combined OCP use; OCP use is likely to have prevented larger numbers of endometrial and ovarian cancers.Women seeking contraceptive advice should be told of potential adverse effects, but should also be told that – along with reproductive health benefits – combined OCP use can reduce long-term risks of ovarian and endometrial cancers.To estimate the proportion and number of cancers occurring in Australia in 2010 attributable to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use.We estimated the population attributable fraction for cancers causally associated with MHT (breast, endometrium, ovary), and the proportion of colorectal cancers prevented by MHT. We used standard formulae incorporating Australian prevalence data, relative risks of cancer associated with MHT and cancer incidence. We also estimated potential change in cancer incidence under two hypothetical scenarios whereby 25% fewer Australian women used MHT, or women exclusively used oestrogen-only MHT.An estimated 539 cancers in Australia in 2010 were attributable to MHT: 453 breast, 67 endometrial and 19 ovarian cancers equating to 3.4%, 3.1% and 1.6% of each cancer type, respectively. In contrast, MHT may have prevented 52 colorectal cancers. If 25% fewer women used MHT, then 141 cancers may have been avoided. If women exclusively used oestrogen-only MHT then 240 cancers may have been avoided.MHT use caused more than 500 cancers in Australian women in 2010 and prevented ∼50 colorectal cancers.MHT use continues to cause an excess of cancers. The risks, benefits, regimen and treatment duration should be carefully considered for each woman before MHT is commenced.\n",

      "Abstract: This prospective observational study explored the association of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and small-for-gestational age (SGA) with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as determined by screening measures for OSA and sleep studies.Two symptom-based screening questionnaires, the Berlin Questionnaire (BQ) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), were administered to enroll 1509 gravidae. Screen positive subjects were referred for polysomnography (PSG). The primary outcome was the occurrence of either gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.

For cancers other than lung, we applied the standard PAF formula using relative risks from a large cohort and derived notional smoking prevalence. To estimate the PAF for partners' smoking, we used the standard formula incorporating the proportion of non-smoking Australians living with an ever-smoking partner and relative risks associated with partner smoking.An estimated 15,525 (13%) cancers in Australia in 2010 were attributable to tobacco smoke, including 8,324 (81%) lung, 1,973 (59%) oral cavity and pharynx, 855 (60%) oesophagus and 951 (6%) colorectal cancers. Of these, 136 lung cancers in non-smokers were attributable to partner tobacco smoke.More than one in eight cancers in Australia is attributable to tobacco smoking and would be avoided if nobody smoked.Strategies to reduce the prevalence of smoking remain a high priority for cancer control.\n",
