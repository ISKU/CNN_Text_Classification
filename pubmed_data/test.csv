3:::Evening prednisolone suppressed 24hour GH secretion (P=0.016), overnight GH secretion (P=0.023) and IGF-I (P=0.024) when compared to morning prednisolone, but not when compared to run-in. Evening prednisolone also increased nocturnal insulin levels as compared to run-in (P=0.010). Irrespective of time of day, prednisolone increased serum collagen markers PICP, PIINP, ICTP and PINP (all P<0.05).
4:::Short-term prednisolone 5mg administered in the morning may alleviate nocturnal GH suppression as compared to evening administration. In analogy, growth rates are less affected by morning as compared to evening administration of exogenous glucocorticoids. In contrast, collagen markers and metabolic indices were not affected by the timing of prednisolone administration.
1:::To assess the reliability of the Fazekas score on brain CT in acute stroke patients.
2:::Two raters evaluated the Fazekas score in 157 CT scans from consecutive patients with acute stroke.
3:::The inter-observer agreements were high for the measurements of the left renal vein (r=0.918, P<0.001). The median overall survival (OS) for patients with renal vein diameter ≥11mm was less than that for patients with renal vein diameter < 11mm (P < 0.001; 2.5vs. 32.0 months). One-year survival rates were 15.3% vs 66.4%. Multivariate analysis revealed renal vein diameter ≥11mm (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.94; P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.67-5.20) and a high model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) Na score (HR: 3.39; P<0.001; 95% CI: 2.00-5.74) were significant independent predictors of mortality.
2:::This is a retrospective cohort study of infants less than 29 weeks gestational age from 2006 to 2014 who underwent PDA ligation. Infants with laryngeal symptoms underwent flexible fibreoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy to evaluate vocal cord function. We compared short- and long-term morbidities among infants with and without symptomatic LVCP.
4:::These preliminary results showed that strain and shear wave elastography had similar diagnostic performance. The addition of strain and shear wave elastography to B-mode US improved diagnostic performance. The combination of strain and shear wave elastography results in a higher diagnostic yield than each individual elastographic modality.
3:::The dosimetric impact of both the MV and kV probe models agreed within ± 2% for both beam configurations. For scenario (i) and 1 mm voxel model, the probe gave mean dose increases of 1.2% to 4.6% (of the dose at isocenter) for 5 mm separation to 0 mm overlap in the probe-phantom contact region, respectively. This increased to 27.5% for the largest interfraction motion correction considered (14mm overlap). For separations of ≥ 2 mm dose differences were < 2%. Simulated dose perturbations were found to be superficial; for the 14 mm overlap the dose increase reduced to < 3% at 5.0 mm within the phantom. For scenario (ii), dose increases due to the probe were < 5% in all cases. The dose increase was underestimated by up to ~13% when the voxel size was increased from 1mm to 3mm. MC simulated dose to the PTV and OARs for the two clinical plans considered showed good agreement with commercial treatment planning system results (within 2%). Mean dose increases due to the presence of the probe, after the maximum interfraction motion correction, were ~16.3% and ~8.0%, in the contact region, for plan 1 and plan 2 respectively.
2:::This is a cross-sectional study using baseline data from a cohort study of older adults in the Netherlands (≥65 years) with joint pain and comorbidity (n = 407). We used the Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly (CANE) to assess self-perceived care needs. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between needs and sociodemographic factors (age, gender, partner status and educational level), physical factors (pain intensity, comorbidity, frailty and physical functioning) and psychosocial factors (anxiety, depression and social support).
4:::Linear trend was observed for serum leptin levels with weight, BMI, WC, HC, WHR, MAC and WHtR in both genders. Though the serum leptin levels were higher among risk groups, according to WHR, WC and BMI, the hyperleptinaemia was observed only among females.
3:::Intraoperative fractures occurred in nine (2%) primary TWAs, while postoperative fractures occurred after eight (2%) TWAs. After analyzing demographics, comorbidities, and surgical factors, intraoperative fractures were found to be associated with only age at surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.20; p = 0.006) and use of a bone graft (HR, 5.80; 95% CI, 1.18-23.08; p = 0.03). No factors were found to be associated with increased risk of postoperative fractures; specifically, intraoperative fracture was not associated with subsequent fracture development. The 5-, 10-, and 15-year Kaplan-Meier survival rates free of postoperative fracture were 99%, 98%, and 95%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year revision-free survival rates after intraoperative fracture were 88% and 88%, respectively, compared with 84% and 74% without an intraoperative fracture (p = 0.36). Furthermore, the survival-free of revision surgery rates for aseptic distal loosening at 5 and 10 years were 88% and 88%, respectively, compared with 93% and 87% without a fracture (p = 0.85).
2:::Adults with a new diagnosis of celiac disease were surveyed at baseline, 6 months and 1 year using standardized measures for intestinal symptoms [Rome III diagnostic questionnaire and celiac symptom index (CSI)] and gluten-free diet adherence [gluten-free eating assessment tool (GF-EAT) and celiac diet adherence test].
3:::After 8 weeks of treatment, when compared to the placebo group, the active treated patients experienced a more favorable percentage change in total cholesterol (-16.3% vs 9.9%, P < 0.001 always), LDL-C (-23.4% vs -13.2%, P < 0.001 always), and hepatic steatosis index (-2.8%, P < 0.01 vs -1.8%, P < 0.05). Moreover, ALT (-27.7%, P < 0.001), AST (-13.8%, P = 0.004), and serum uric acid (-12.3%, P = 0.005) were reduced by the tested nutraceutical compound both compared to randomization and to placebo, which did not affect these parameters (P < 0.01 for all). Regarding the hemodynamic parameters, there was a decrease of systolic blood pressure (-5.6%) with the active treatment not observed with placebo (P < 0.05 vs baseline and placebo) and endothelial reactivity improved, too (-13.2%, P < 0.001 vs baseline). Consequently, the estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk score improved by 1.19% (SE 0.4%) (P = 0.01) in the nutraceutical-treated patients.
1:::Circulating cancer associated macrophage-like cells (CAMLs) have been detected in the peripheral blood of patients with solid tumors including breast cancer. However, the prognostic relevance of CAMLs in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has not been evaluated. In the present study, we aimed to measure CAMLs and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) at baseline and examine their prognostic value in patients with MBC.
4:::Multiple surgical treatments are used for talar OCDs after primary surgical failure. More invasive methods are administered in comparison with primary treatment. No methodologically proper meta-analysis could be performed because of the low level of evidence and the limited number of patients. It is therefore inappropriate to draw firm conclusions from the collected results. Besides an expected difference in outcome between the autograft transfer procedure and the more extensive procedures of mosaicplasty and the use of an allograft, neither a clear nor a significant difference between treatment options could be demonstrated. The need for sufficiently powered prospective investigations in a randomized comparative clinical setting remains high. This present systematic review can be used in order to inform patients about expected outcome of the different treatment methods used after failed primary surgery.
3:::For patients with BVMD, single heterozygous BEST1 mutations were identified in 13 patients and compound heterozygous mutations were found in 3 patients. For patients with ARB, biallelic mutations were found in 13 probands and single mutant alleles in six patients. Overall, 36 disease-causing variants (20 novel mutations) of the BEST1 gene were identified, including 28 (77.8%) missense, 3 (8.3%) nonsense, 4 (11.1%) splicing effect, and 1 (2.8%) frameshift small duplication mutations.
2:::This retrospective cross-sectional study included 10 NAION eyes and 16 OAG eyes, both demonstrating hemifield visual field defects, and 27 normal eyes serving as controls. The peripapillary and macular OCT-A scans were acquired. The retinal vessel density data were compared among NAION, glaucomatous, as well as control eyes.
3:::Overall, an estimated 40.8% of cancer cases in Alberta in 2012 were attributable to modifiable lifestyle and environmental risk factors. The largest proportion of cancers were estimated to be attributable to tobacco smoking, physical inactivity and excess body weight. The summary population attributable risk estimate was slightly higher among women (42.4%) than among men (38.7%).
4:::Although long-term randomised data are lacking, observational data suggest similar shock efficacy and short-term complication rates between the S-ICD and TV-ICD.
2:::Injury incidence was defined as a medical consultation by a tournament physician and in-event treatment frequency as the mean total number of follow-up medical/physiotherapy consultations (2013-2016 tournaments only). Data were collated by sex, injury region and type and reported as frequencies per 10 000 game exposures. Incidence rate s± 95% CI and rate ratios were used to test effects for injury, sex and year.
3:::Among 169 participants, intention to use a self-test was positively associated with comfort in testing by a friend or a partner at home (Adjusted odds ratio, AOR, 2.40; 95% CI 1.09-5.30), and stigma or fear as a reason not to test (AOR 8.61; 95% CI 2.50-29.68) and negatively associated with higher social support (AOR 0.48; 95% CI 0.33-0.72) and having health insurance (AOR 0.21; 95% CI 0.09-0.54). Intention to test at a clinic or other provider was positively associated with self-efficacy for HIV testing (AOR 2.87; 95% CI 1.48-5.59) and social support (AOR 1.98; 95% CI 1.34-2.92), and negatively associated with a lifetime history of incarceration (AOR 0.37; 95% CI 0.16-0.89). Intention to test by CHTC was negatively associated with higher educational level (Some college or Associates degree vs high school graduate or less [AOR 0.81; 95% CI 0.39-1.70]; Bachelor's degree or more vs high school graduate or less [AOR 0.28; 95% CI 0.11-0.70]).'
2:::Mice were subjected to permanent stroke by right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Multimodel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method was assessed to define the penumbra as that brain region in which the perfusion and diffusion-weighted MR images are mismatched (perfusion-weighted imaging [PWI]-diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI] mismatch). MRI measurements were performed at 1 hour after MCA occlusion (MCAO). Sigma-1 receptor expression was assessed by immunoblotting and immunostaining in PWI-DWI-defined penumbra and core compared with sham or contralateral slice. Penumbral sigma-1 receptor identified the correlation with the neuron, astrocyte, and microglia by immuno-colocalization.
3:::Sigma-1 receptor was significantly upregulated in penumbra or peri-infarct compared with sham and core tissue at 1 hour and 24 hours after MCAO. There was a colocalization of sigma-1 receptor and neuron in penumbra at 1 hour after stroke. Sigma-1 receptor is specifically increased in ischemic penumbral neuron at 1 hour after MCAO.
4:::Sigma-1 receptor may act as an endogenous marker of penumbra after acute ischemic stroke.
2:::Serum samples obtained from 314 patients including dermatomyositis (DM) (n=144), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (n=50), systemic sclerosis (SSc) (n=50), Sjögrens syndrome (SS) (n=50), polymyositis (PM) (n=10) and mixed connective tissue disease (n=10), and healthy controls (n=42) in addition to 10 patients with typical sIBM were analysed for the presence of autoantibodies using full-length recombinant NT5C1A ELISA.'
3:::Japanese patients with DM (11%), PM (10%), SLE (6%), SSc (8%) or SS (4%) had anti-NT5C1A antibodies at lower frequencies than patients with sIBM. Interestingly, 4 of 17 DM/PM patients with anti-NT5C1A antibodies were found to have no other myositis-specific/associated autoantibodies.
3:::356/939 (37.9%) of patients underwent head CT. Initial CT ≤24h after CA was normal in 174/218 (79.8%), whilst generalised oedema was diagnosed in 21/218 (9.6%). Between days 1-7, generalised oedema was seen in 65/143 (45.5%), acute/subacute infarction in 27/143 (18.9%) and bleeding in 9/143 (6.3%). Overall, generalised oedema predicted poor outcome with 33.6% sensitivity (95%CI:28.1-39.5) and 98.4% specificity (95%CI:94.3-99.6), whilst peak NSE demonstrated sensitivities of 61.5-64.8% and specificity 95.7% (95%CI:89.5-98.4). The combination of peak NSE >38ng/l and generalised oedema on CT predicted poor outcome with 46.0% sensitivity (95%CI:36.5-55.8) with no false positives. NSE was significantly higher in patients with generalised oedema.
2:::Seventy two patients (72 eyes: 22 eyes SND+ and 50 eyes SND-) with treatment-naïve, center-involving DME were evaluated. Data gathering included fundus color photographs, fluorescein angiography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and microperimetry. The following parameters were evaluated with SD-OCT: central macular thickness (CMT, including SND); central retinal thickness (CRT, excluding SND); choroidal thickness (CT); nasal and temporal retinal thickness (RT) at 500 μm and 1500 μm from the fovea; the number of hyper-reflective retinal spots (HRS) in the central 3000 μm; and the presence of SND and integrity of the external limiting membrane (ELM). Retinal sensitivity (RS) was evaluated within 4° and 12° of the fovea. Correlation among CT, RS, and HRS in patients with and without SND was determined.
4:::This data may improve characterization of DME in eyes with SND. DME with SND correlates with greater CT, more HRS, disruption of the ELM and significant macular functional impairment (RS decrease) vs SND-.
3:::MIBD MRI provided a diagnostic accuracy of 87.93% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 80.58-93.24%) for R1 and 89.66% (95% CI: 82.63-94.54%) for R2. Expert reading of the FDP revealed a similar accuracy of 86.2% (95% CI: 78.67-91.43%). The positive predictive value (PPV) could be increased from 36.2% (95% CI: 28.02-45.28; X-ray mammography alone) to a mean PPV of 80.89% (R1 79.17%, R2 82.16%) using MIBD MRI. Mean reading time was 30 seconds (25%/75 percentile 24.5-41.25).
4:::Loss of SFRP1 likely contributes to tumor progression by altering the expression of a critical transcription factor in both the epithelium and the immune system.
2:::Participants were 52,535 Ohio Valley residents (Fibromyalgia n = 1125). All participants completed a comprehensive health survey (2005-2006) part of the C8 Health Project; serum levels of CRP were obtained, as was history of Fibromyalgia physician diagnosis. Logistic and linear regressions were used for this cross-sectional analysis.
3:::Adult rat urinary bladder expressed various PDE mRNA with the following rank order: PDE5A ≈ PDE9A ≈ PDE10A > PDE2A ≈ PDE4A ≈ PDE4D > PDE4B ≈ PDE3B ≈ PDE8B ≈ PDE7A ≈ PDE7B > PDE1A. PDE1B, PDE1C, PDE3A, PDE4C, PDE8A, and PDE11A were not detected. Of interest, the mRNA and protein of PDE3A were significantly decreased in adult rat urinary bladder compared to neonatal rat urinary bladder. Cilostamide, a specific inhibitor for PDE3, significantly inhibited the amplitude and frequency of carbachol-enhanced phasic contractions of neonatal rat bladder strips by 38.8% and 12.1%, respectively. Compared to the neonatal rat bladder, the effect of cilostamide was significantly blunted in adult rat urinary bladder: the amplitude and frequency of carbachol-enhanced phasic contractions were decreased by 13.4% (P < 0.01 vs neonatal rat bladder) and 4.4%, respectively. However, the mRNA and the protein levels of PDE3B were similar between neonatal and adult rat bladder.
3:::There were recurrences in 29 of the 166 patients (17.4%). Measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the cut-off value of SUVmax with maximum sensitivity and specificity was 10.95. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, the DFS of the patients categorized by SUVmax tended to differ (P = 0.055). In univariate analyses, the risk factors for DFS were age over 70 years, higher N stage and neural invasion. SUVmax  ≤ 10.95 showed a tendency, but was not significant (P = 0.0604). In multivariate analyses, the risk factors for DFS were age over 70 and neural invasion.
2:::Before the study, expression level of miR-30c-5p and targeted protein was detected in 40 GC tissue samples and 5 GC cells by RT-qPCR. Meanwhile, correlation analysis was conducted between miR-30c-5p expression level and clinicopathological features. In addition, wound healing assay and cell invasion assay were utilized to identify whether miR-30c-5p could affect the migrated and invaded ability of GC cells. Western blotting assay and luciferase assay were used to explore the potential mechanism.
4:::SCC resulted in better thermoregulation in neonates undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. There were no significant differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes, but the study was underpowered to answer this. Randomized trials are needed to fine-tune various aspects of TH in neonates with HIE.
1:::We investigated the impact of 19 factors on life quality in Hungarian patients with epilepsy. Wellbeing was evaluated by several inventories to investigate the impact of factors in more detail.
3:::Correlation imaging performs better than existing parallel imaging techniques in simulated brain imaging acceleration experiments. The higher speed enables real-time data acquisition for neonatal cardiac imaging in which physiological motion is fast and non-periodic.
2:::Multispectral MRI techniques resolve off-resonance distortions by a combination of limited excitation bins and additional encoding. Inspired by robust principal component analysis, a novel compact representation of multispectral images as a sum of rank-one and sparse matrices corresponding to on- and off-resonance respectively is described. This representation is used in a calibration-free and model-free reconstruction for data with an undersampling pattern that varies between bins. Retrospective undersampling was used to compare the proposed reconstruction and bin-by-bin compressed sensing. Hip images were acquired in eight patients with standard and prospectively undersampled three-dimensional multispectral imaging, and image quality was evaluated by two radiologists on a 5-point scale.
3:::Fifty-four studies were included (4,168 participants). A higher occurrence of anterograde amnesia was observed when benzodiazepines, the most well-studied sedatives (n = 47), were used than when placebo was used (n = 12) (RR = 3.10; 95% CI: 2.30-4.19, P<0.001; I2 = 14%), with a moderate level of evidence. Higher doses of alpha2-adrenergic agonists (clonidine/dexmedetomidine) produced more anterograde amnesia than lower doses (n = 2) (RR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.03-3.25; P = 0.038; I2 = 0%), with a low level of evidence; benzodiazepines amnestic effects were not dose-dependent (n = 3) (RR = 1.54; 95% CI: 0.96-2.49; P = 0.07; I2 = 12%) but the evidence was low. A qualitative analysis showed that retrograde amnesia did not occur in 8 out of 10 studies.'
2:::A quantitative and qualitative evaluation through a survey and focal groups including general population from two health departments in Spain. The sampling was carried out in stages (according to health department size) and stratified by age and sex, to get a representative sample. We randomly selected the participants from these stages to be contacted by telephone by a trained nurse. Oral informed consent was obtained.
4:::It is reassuring that in the short term, in this group of patients, the treatment outcomes were similar.
3:::The difference in % of inhibition was significant concerning inhibition of P. dominulus sIgE by P. dominulus venom (79.8%) compared with inhibition by mAP venom (64.2%) and not significant concerning the inhibition of mAP sIgE by P. dominulus venom (80.1%) and by mAP venom (73.6%). Instead, the clinical protection from stings was not statistically different between the two kinds of venom.
2:::Representative videos of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) were voluntarily submitted by 20 surgeons who participated in a statewide quality improvement collaborative. The amount of time required to complete the salient steps of the operation was measured and variations in the tasks performed during each step were captured.
3:::About 20/21 patients had FDG-positive lymphoma (Deauville score ≥3). Uptake of (68)Ga-DOTANOC was regarded as positive if Krenning score was ≥2 and resulted in 13/21 (62%) patients having (68)Ga-DOTANOC-positive lymphomas. The highest uptake of (68)Ga-DOTANOC was seen in Hodgkins lymphoma of nodular sclerosis subtype and in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (SUVmax median 9.8 and 9.7, respectively). Both cases showed strong SSTR2 immunopositivity in tumor cells. Some patients had SSTR2 immunopositivity predominantly in endothelial and dendritic cells and follicular centers of lymph nodes contributing to a positive PET/CT with probably low tumor-specific uptake. SSTR3 and SSTR5 were negative in most lymphoma subtypes.'
4:::- As teaching by example was identified as a common educational method, faculty must be aware of the role their behavior and attitudes have in shaping resident behavior and attitudes. These results suggest a need for additional resources to teach professionalism during pathology residency.
3:::R0 was estimated for 20 municipalities with a median of 30,000 inhabitants, all located less than 2,200 m above sea level. The reported cases ranged from 17 to 347 between these municipalities within four months (January to April of 2016). The results suggest that 15 municipalities had a high transmission potential (R0 >1), whereas in 5 municipalities transmission were potentially not sustaining (R0 <1), though the upper bound of the confidence interval of the R0 for 3 of these 5 was greater than one, indicating the possibility of an outbreak later on.
2:::This is a cross sectional study conducted in adults living at urban area of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Data of adiposity, lifestyle, triglyceride, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, leptin and UCP2 gene polymorphism were obtained in 380 men and female adults.
4:::Long-term presence of fixed lingual retainers does not seem to increase the development of mandibular gingival recession, but does increase calculus accumulation.
3:::75%, 76% and 71% reports were classified under the physical domain for tamsulosin, levothyroxine and amphetamine/dextroamphetamine, while 9%, 9% and 18% reports were classified under the mental domain, respectively.
3:::At baseline, awareness and knowledge reflected no former abusive head trauma training. Following the intervention participants had an increased awareness of Shaken Baby Syndrome, the potential consequences of shaking infants, and had acquired techniques to inform parents how to manage the crying infant.
2:::Young adult participants (18-25 years) in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2008-2014) with past-year psychological distress or AOD abuse were included. Difference-in-differences logistic regression models estimated rural/urban differences in insurance, MH, and AOD treatment pre- versus post-ACA reforms. Analyses adjusted for gender, race, marital status, and health status.
4:::Although urine EtG and EtS concentration did not significantly correlate to estimated peak blood alcohol concentrations or the number of alcoholic drinks consumed, a significant correlation was found with urine ethanol concentration. However, urine EtG and EtS concentrations did not significantly correlate with overall hangover severity.
3:::Results indicated the following current internship training patterns: Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (68% to 51%), Personality Assessment Inventory (59% to 25%), Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (51% to 34%), Rorschach (35 to 26%), story telling (41% to 19%), sentence completion (41% to 18%), and drawings (36% to 9%). Adult program directors reported higher percentages for objective tests; child program directors reported higher percentages for projective tests.
2:::We retrospectively reviewed data of patients, who underwent EUS-HGS at our center, with at least 6 months of follow-up. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from the patients charts and electronic records. Technical success rate was defined as the successful passage of the Giobor stent across the stomach, along with the flow of contrast medium and/or bile through the stent. Functional success rate was considered achieved when the decrease of bilirubin value of at least 25% within the 1st week was obtained. The rate of early and late complications was assessed.'
3:::Patients demographics and myoma characteristics were comparable between the two groups. The overall spontaneous pregnancy rate increased from 0% to 68.42% following myomectomy. The postoperative infertility rate was significantly higher in the non-CDMs group than that in the CDMs group (50.00% vs. 23.53%, t = 5.579, P = 0.018), whereas the postoperative spontaneous pregnancy rate was significantly lower in the non-CDMs group than that in the CDMs group (47.62% vs. 70.59%, t = 4.067, P = 0.044). Compared with the enucleation of non-CDM, the enucleation of CDM patients was a protective factor for the fertility restoration (risk ratio [RR] = 3.717, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.284-10.753, P = 0.015), although postoperative fertility restoration declined with age (RR = 1.141, 95% CI: 1.005-1.295, P = 0.041).'
4:::The challenges to accessing appropriate services for deafness operate prior to presentation and include educational, cultural, navigational and financial barriers especially for those of lower socioeconomic status and residents of rural areas. The findings highlighted the need to raise awareness and implement wider screening programmes for early interventions.
3:::The data revealed that in molar ratio 1:3 (heparin: CPβCD), the n-octanol recovery was maximized and reached 67.6±11.86%. Size, PdI, zeta potential, EE% in gastric medium and EE% in intestinal medium for optimized nano-droplets were reported as 307±30.51 nm, 0.236±0.02, +2.1±0.66 mV, 90.2±0.04 and 96.1±0.73%, respectively. Microscopic images revealed spherical nano-droplets. The obtained data revealed no burst release of heparin from nano-droplets.
2:::In this study, we investigated a healthy sample (N = 298) that was genotyped for the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR). We hypothesized that 5-HTTLPR gene variation would influence well-being, and additionally investigated interaction effects with age and the environmental influence of early life stress (ELS).
1:::To report the pre- and post-operative findings of a case with dysfunctional lens syndrome.
3:::A 45-year-old male patient presented with the chief complaint of poor visual quality; uncorrected visual acuity 20/40 in the right eye, best spectacle corrected visual acuity 20/25 in the right eye with refraction Plano/-1.50 × 80 (SE = -0.75D). Pre- and post-operative root-mean-square (RMS) of total higherorder aberrations in the entire eye, the internal optics and the cornea were 0.350 & 0.257, 0.311 & 0.236 and 0.214 & 0.191 micron (μ), respectively. Also, the magnitude of preoperative total, internal and corneal coma was 0.254 μ × 222°, 0.274μ×242° and 0.097μ × 131° and postoperative values were 0.170 μ × 162°, 0.131 μ × 177°, 0.054 μ × 125°, respectively.
4:::Flow-diverter treatment achieves high occlusion rates and can cause major aneurysm shrinkage. CeMRA is highly valuable regarding imaging of the aneurysmal sac. There are limitations regarding the assessability of the stent lumen on ceMRA.
2:::Retrospective review of records of all LSG patients operated upon at Hamad General Hospital, Qatar (2011-2014, n = 1555). All patients were screened by p-OGD. Patient characteristics were analyzed, and p-OGD findings were categorized into four groups employing Sharaf et al.s classification (Obes Surg 14:1367-1372, 23). We assessed the impact of p-OGD findings on any change in surgical management or lack thereof.'
3:::Twenty-six of 35 programs responded, for a response rate of 74%. The majority found the milestones somewhat or very useful, half found the graduation-level milestones matched the programs graduation goals, and a significant majority reported that the milestones assisted in identifying improvements, change, or intended change. In choosing terms to describe the milestones, however respondents chose a variety of negative or neutral terms, rather than positive ones.'
2:::We administered an anonymous questionnaire to 59 physically active women in Canada. Surveys were completed electronically or on paper. Demographic information was obtained. Questions about which specific activities caused leakage, adaptive behaviors to deal with urinary loss, and degree of bother were addressed, and knowledge and interest in therapies for leakage were queried.
3:::There were significant differences in the distribution of genotype and allele frequencies of rs2779249 and rs2297518 between hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Logistic regression analyses were performed with different genetic models (additive, dominant, recessive) adjusting for confounding risk covariates, including age, sex, body mass index, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, drinking, and family history of hypertension. The odds ratio (OR) was 1.27 (1.12, 1.44) in the additive model, 1.31 (1.09, 1.59) in the dominant, and 1.68 (1.28, 2.19) in the recessive model of rs2779249; the OR was 1.26 (1.06, 1.50) in the additive model and 1.46 (1.13, 1.89) in the dominant model of rs2297518.
4:::A good relationship between cQFR and SPECT MPI was found. cQFR was independently associated with ischemia on SPECT MPI and showed incremental value to detect ischemia compared to clinical and QCA parameters.
1:::The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of interpupillary distance (IPD) and pupil diameter (PD) measures using an infrared eye tracker and central point stimuli. Validity of the test compared to known clinical tools was determined, and normative data was established against which individuals can measure themselves.
3:::The caesarean section rates in a total of 86 262 births with complete data were analysed. The overall caesarean section rate increased modestly from 15.4% to 24.6% during the study period. There was an obvious increasing trend for caesarean section in those with previous caesarean section (Robsons category 5), breech presentation at delivery (category 6 and 7), multiple pregnancy (category 8), and preterm labour (category 10). A gradual fall in caesarean section rate from 14.4% to 10.8% was seen in primiparous women with term spontaneous labour (category 1). Statistically significant differences (P<0.001) in these trends were confirmed when the data were stratified into 5-year intervals for comparison.'
2:::Standardised perinatal/neonatal data were collected for 449 infants with gestational age of 23+0 to 29+6 weeks and/or birth weight of <1500 g who were born at Queen Mary Hospital between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2014. These data were compared with all neonatal centres in the Vermont Oxford Network in 2013. The Chi squared test was used to compare the categorical Queen Mary Hospital data with that of Vermont Oxford Network. A two-tailed P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
4:::Increased PAOAAM signal on STIR is a highly sensitive indicator of an acute C1-C2 fracture on MR imaging. Furthermore, increased PAOAAM STIR signal as an isolated finding is highly specific for the presence of a C1-C2 fracture, making it a useful sign on MR imaging when CT is either unavailable or the findings are equivocal.
3:::CMR-derived variables associated with MACE (n=6) were right ventricular (RV) or left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) (HR 2.06,95% CI 1.168 to 3.623, p=0.012 and HR 2.35,95% CI 1.348 to 4.082, p=0.003, respectively), LV stroke volume index (HR 2.82,95% CI 1.212 to 7.092, p=0.028) and cardiac index (HR 1.71,95% CI 1.002 to 1.366, p=0.037); all remained significant when tested solely for mortality. History of AT (HR 11.16,95% CI 1.30 to 95.81, p=0.028) and New York Heart Association class >2 (HR 7.66,95% CI 1.54 to 38.20, p=0.013) were also associated with MACE; AT preceded all but one MACE, suggesting its potential role as an early marker of adverse outcome (p=0.011).CMR variables associated with first-onset AT (n=17; 21.5%) included RVEF (HR 1.55,95% CI 1.103 to 2.160, p=0.011), total R/L volume index (HR 1.18,95% CI 1.06 to 1.32, p=0.002), RV/LV end diastolic volume ratio (HR 1.55,95% CI 1.14 to 2.10, p=0.005) and apical septal leaflet displacement/total LV septal length (HR 1.03,95% CI 1.00 to 1.07, p=0.041); the latter two combined enhanced risk prediction (HR 6.12,95% CI 1.67 to 22.56, p=0.007).
2:::ADSCI development and validation was based on the construction and comparison of three different tools: ADSCI score constructed by three rounds of expert consensus (ADSCI-Delphi) and two multiple regression models (ADSCI-RM-Simple and ADSCI-RM-Mixed). Their predictive capability was compared by means of R(2) values in the same subrogated of surgical complexity as in the Mirza index validation: intraoperative bleeding and duration of surgery. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves and area under the curve (AUC) analysis. The external validity was also examined by evaluating its predictive capability in another multicenter ASD database of comparable patients in the USA.
3:::80 subjects (55 women), mean age 58.5±11.1 years and cough duration 86.0±123.7 months were enrolled. At baseline, worse cough severity was significantly associated with less education and worse ability to speak bothered by cough and urge to cough. Worse CQOL was significantly associated with worse depression symptoms, urinary incontinence, ability to speak and use of self-prescribed remedies and younger age. Significant improvements in depression and stress symptoms occurred at 3 and 6 months. Anxiety symptoms improved, particularly in the first 3 months. Improvement in cough severity was significantly associated with less education, male gender, and improvement in ability to speak and urge to cough. Improvement in CQOL was significantly associated with improvement in urinary incontinence, urge to cough, anxiety symptoms and use of self-prescribed remedies.
4:::Using the Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms, we have come to appreciate that managing psychological, physiological, and situational factors in addition to just focusing on identifying the cause(s) of cough is important to maximize improvement in CQOL.
2:::We identified 8 patients (2 men, 6 women) in our database. Clinical information and functional outcome scores were collected, including range of movement, Toronto Extremity Salvage Score, the Musculoskeletal Tumor Score. Radiographs from the last clinic follow-up were analyzed.
3:::Although miR-29a was highly expressed in the myocardium, miR-29a plasma levels did not show any correlation with serum troponin I levels (rs=-0.12, p=0.43), and the heart does not release significant amounts of miR-29a into the circulation via exosome secretion. Conversely, miR-29a was present in red blood cells, and plasma levels correlated significantly with markers of hemolysis: lactic dehydrogenase (rs=0.36, p=0.01) and the absorbance of oxyhemoglobin at 414nm (rs=0.39, p=0.006). Furthermore, the association between serum haptoglobin and the maximal blood flow velocity in the left ventricle outflow tract (rs=-0.42, p=0.008) indicated that intravascular hemolysis is a manifestation of the disease.
2:::The aim of this study is to compare preoperative strategy integrating computer-assisted 3D simulation and biomechanical calculation and traditional strategy. A retrospective method was used to compare the effect and difference between these 2 strategies. The clinical data of 18 patients with sagittal synostosis were collected and compared. Among them, 10 patients were enrolled in Group A applied with traditional treatment method, while 8 were enrolled in Group B applied with preoperative strategy integrating computer-assisted 3D simulation and biomechanical calculation. The aim of this study is to evaluate two treatment methods by investigating indexes between two groups, such as length of operation, blood loss, operation cost, and postoperative complications. Through comparing the cranial index, head circumference, and cranial vault asymmetry index of two groups before and after treatment, the surgical effects of two groups can be evaluated. Moreover, biomechanical analyses for two groups were conducted.
3:::Both repairs provided a linear progression (slope) of footprint force and pressure as increasing tendon loads were applied. However, the knotless repair had a significantly higher progression (""self-reinforcement"" effect) than the knotted repair at both abduction angles (P = .006 at 0° and P = .021 at 30°). The addition of medial-row knots did not significantly change the footprint contact area (in square millimeters), contact force (in newtons), contact pressure (in kilopascals), or peak pressure (in kilopascals) at each load tested, as well as at both abduction angles. For a given repair, only the knotless repair had significant decreases in contact area, contact force, contact pressure, and peak pressure with increasing abduction angles from 0° to 30° (P = .004 and P = .048).
4:::We found a strong concordance between radiographic and surgical navigation measurements of the MFA. This may imply that teleradiography is not necessary when using surgical navigation in TKA.
3:::Bioequivalence was established with a mean average total IgG trough level at steady state being 8.05g/L with TEGELINE(®) and 9.17g/L with ClairYg(®) (i.e. geometric mean for the difference between ClairYg(®) and TEGELINE(®) was 1.136; [90% CI: 1.092-1.181] P<0.001), within the pre-specified margin to establish bioequivalence (0.80-1.25). Total IgG trough levels remained clinically adequate (>4-6g/L) throughout the study. No patient was hospitalized for infection or had serious bacterial infections while receiving ClairYg(®). The median annualized infections rate per patient was similar for both products: 4.35 [0; 21.8] for TEGELINE(®) and 4.30 [0; 15.1] for ClairYg(®). Infections were less common with higher IgG trough levels (>8.16g/L). ClairYg(®) showed good safety, in particular good hepatic and renal tolerance, and did not induce hemolysis. ClairYg(®) pharmacokinetics profile was comparable to that of TEGELINE(®).
2:::This retrospective study looked at 18 patients who underwent TAVR. Patient-specific aortic root phantoms were created using the tissue-mimicking 3D printing technique using pre-TAVR computed tomography. The CoreValve (self-expanding valve) prostheses were deployed in the phantoms to simulate the TAVR procedure, from which post-TAVR aortic root strain was quantified in vitro. A novel index, the annular bulge index, was measured to assess the post-TAVR annular strain unevenness in the phantoms. We tested the comparative predictive value of the bulge index and other known predictors of post-TAVR PVL.
4:::A paradox regarding the independent association of elevated BMI with reduced mortality after PCI is still evident in contemporary U.K. practice. This is seen in both stable and more acute clinical settings.
3:::Both age-based discrete normative data and demographically adjusted (sex, age, and education) regression-based formulae were established. The demographic variables varied in their contribution to each MACFIMS test in the regression models, predicting 0 to 18% of the variance.
2:::Variations in molecular markers in juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma in an Indian population were investigated and compared with global reports.
3:::The average end-tidal sevoflurane concentration was lower in the Lignocaine group compared to saline [1.49% (SD: 0.32) vs. 1.89% (SD: 0.29); 95% CI 0.26-0.5, p < 0.001]. In the Lignocaine group, the average mean arterial pressure was 80.3 mmHg (SD: 4.9) compared to 85.1 mmHg (SD: 5.4) in the Saline group (95% CI 2.4-7.1, p < 0.001). Systolic blood pressure was also lower in the Lignocaine group: 121.7 mmHg (SD: 6.1) vs. 128.0 mmHg (SD: 6.4) in the Saline group; 95% CI 3.5-9.2, p < 0.001, as was the mean heart rate [Lignocaine group: 74.9 beats/min (SD: 1.8) vs. 81.5 beats/min (SD: 1.7) in the Saline group, 95% CI 4.1-9.1, p < 0.001]. Maintenance fluid requirements were higher in the Lignocaine group: 3281.1 mL (SD: 1094.6) vs. 2552.6 mL (SD: 1173.5) in the Saline group, 95% CI 206-1251, p = 0.007. There were no differences in the use of vasoactive drugs.
2:::To address the above question, female mice received either a bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) or were sham-operated, and femur osteotomy was performed 8 weeks after OVX/sham operation. The effects of OVX on the presence of immune cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry of the fracture calli on days 1 and 3 after fracture.
4:::The prevalence of impaired fasting glucose and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus are found to be significant. Obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and systolic hypertension are independently associated with impaired fasting glucose among adults. We recommend that the community be aware of healthy life style, early screening, and maintain continuous follow up.
3:::Preoperative SE was -7.16 ± 0.93 D in group-H and -4.34 ± 0.97 D in group-M. At 3 months postoperatively, the SE in group-H and group-M was -0.20 ± 0.37 D and 0.01 ± 0.19 D (t = - 4.11, P<0.05), respectively. It was found that 77% and 98% had an UDVA of 20/20, 98% and 99% had a CDVA of 20/20 in group-H and group-M, respectively, while 87% and 95% had a SE within ±0.5 D and ±1.0 D in group-H, and 98% and 100% in group-M. The efficacy indexes were 0.98 ± 0.18 in group-H and 1.05 ± 0.10 in group-M (t = - 3.084, p < 0.05). The safety indexes were 1.06 ± 0.09 and 1.06 ± 0.09 (t = 0.153, p > 0.05), respectively. There were significant increases in total HOAs, 3(rd)-order coma, and 4(th)-order spherical aberrations.
2:::A case-control study was carried out to measure circulating OPG levels in 42 hypertensive patients with CKD and in 141 hypertensive patients without CKD. A potential relationship between OPG and the presence of CKD was investigated and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was designed thereafter to identify a cut-off value of OPG that best explained the presence of CKD. Secondly, to evaluate whether OPG increase could affect the kidney, 18 C57BL/6J mice were randomized to be treated with saline or recombinant OPG every 3 weeks for 12 weeks.
4:::We found that the full immunization coverage among children aged between 12 and 23 months was below the national (> 80%) and international targets (90%). Geographic area, mothers characteristics, antenatal care and access to health care services were associated with full immunization. These findings highlight the need for innovative strategies based on a holistic approach to overcome the barriers to childhood immunization in Senegal.'
3:::The median weight, age, and LSPV size were 4.3 kg (range, 3.5-5.4 kg), 40 days (range, 20-103 days), and 4.5 mm (range, 3.0-5.4 mm), respectively, during the first operation and 12.2 kg (range, 8.5-31.5 kg), 1,165 days (range, 280-3,250 days), and 9.8 mm (range, 8.0-12.3 mm), respectively, during the second operation. The median Qp/Qs was 1.61 (range, 1.22-1.65) and the median cardiothoracic ratio was 0.52 (range, 0.49-0.57) at second operation. The median interval between the operations was 1,094 days (range, 196-3,226 days). The median follow-up period was 22 month (range, 7-59 month). No mortality or major morbidities occurred after either operation. The median Vmax at the LSPV anastomosis site was 1.0 m/s (range, 0.8-1.3 m/s) on predischarge echocardiography. This patency was maintained at the last follow-up, showing an identical median Vmax of 1.0 m/s (range, 0.8-1.3 m/s). All 7 patients who underwent two-stage correction were in good condition, without any clinical symptoms of PVO.
2:::RERBT and conventional TURBT (C-TURBT) were conducted, respectively, in 40 and 50 patients diagnosed with superficial papillary bladder tumors. In the RERBT group, the tumors were en bloc removed retrogradely under direct vision using a conventional monopolar electrode. Patients clinicopathological, intraoperative, and postoperative data were compared retrospectively between the RERBT and C-TURBT groups.'
4:::The simulated death of the manikin did not have a negative impact on the students PSE, whether or not they had been warned of the possible occurrence of such an event. Our study helps defend the position which supports the inclusion of unexpected death of the manikin in a simulation setting.'
2:::We used an exposure-control matched design. We identified persons in the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada Permanent Resident Database with first eligibility for the Ontario Health Insurance Plan between July 1, 1991 and June 30, 2008 at age 40 years or older, and matched five controls by year of birth and sex on the immigrants first eligibility date. We identified CRC from the Ontario Cancer Registry between the index date and December 31, 2014. All analyses were stratified by sex. We calculated crude and relative rates of CRC. We estimated risk of CRC over time by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared immigrants to controls in age and sex stratified strata using log-rank tests. We modeled the hazard of CRC using Cox proportional hazards regression, accounting for within-cluster correlation by a robust sandwich variance estimation approach, and assessed an interaction with time since eligibility.'
3:::Among females, 1877 cases of CRC were observed among 209,843 immigrants, and 16,517 cases among 1,049,215 controls; the crude relative rate among female immigrants was 0.623. Among males, 1956 cases of CRC were observed among 191,792 immigrants and 18,329 cases among 958,960 controls; the crude relative rate among male immigrants was 0.582.. Comparing immigrants to controls in all age and sex stratified strata, the log rank test p < 0.0001 except for females aged > = 75 years at index, where p = 0.01. The age-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for CRC among female immigrants was 0.63 (95% CI 0.59, 0.67) during the first 10 years, and 0.66 (95% CI 0.59, 0.74) thereafter. Among male immigrants the age-adjusted HR = 0.55 (95% CI 0.52, 0.59) during the first 10 years and increased to 0.63 (95% CI 0.57, 0.71) thereafter. The adjusted HR > = 1 only among immigrants born in Europe and Central Asia.
4:::Using paternal exposure in a negative control model to test the robustness of fetal programming hypotheses can be a relatively simple extension of conventional observational studies but limitations need to be considered.
3:::We find the effect of treatment to be small and positive but transient.
2:::Custom-made spray nozzles were designed and produced with 3D printing technology. A commercially available spraying system was used for comparison. Sprays were characterised based on spray angle, cone width, droplet size, velocity and density. This was performed with conventional and high-speed imaging. Furthermore, cell survival of chondrocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as well as the chondrogenic capacity of chondrocytes after spraying were evaluated.
4:::TERT mutations in urine might be helpful for early detection of recurrence in UBC, especially in NMIBC.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 6 July 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2017.210 www.bjcancer.com.
3:::Administration of lurbinectedin significantly and selectively decreased the number of circulating monocytes and, in tumour tissues, that of macrophages and vessels. Similar findings were observed when a lurbinectedin-resistant tumour variant was used, indicating a direct effect of lurbinectedin on the tumour microenviroment. In vitro, lurbinectedin induced caspase-8-dependent apoptosis of human purified monocytes, whereas at low doses it significantly inhibited the production of inflammatory/growth factors (CCL2, CXCL8 and VEGF) and dramatically impaired monocyte adhesion and migration ability. These findings were supported by the strong inhibition of genes of the Rho-GTPase family in lurbinectedin-treated monocytes.
2:::Between 1992 and 2011, a total of 397 stage I HCC patients were included. Detailed information was retrieved from MD Anderson Cancer Center patients medical records. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate patients' overall survival (OS). Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the estimated hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval of different prognostic factors.'
3:::The transcript levels of NCX3, NCKX2, and NCKX5, protein abundance of NCX3, slope and peak of Δ[Ca2+]i as well as Ica were significantly lower in therapy sensitive D283 than in therapy resistant UW228-3 medulloblastoma cells. The Na+/Ca2+-exchanger inhibitor KB-R7943 (10 µM) significantly blunted Δ[Ca2+]i, and augmented the ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis but did not significantly modify clonogenicity of medulloblastoma cells. Apoptosis was further enhanced by NCX3 silencing.
2:::A random sample of 501 men and women aged 18 to79 years was examined in a cross-sectional manner. The sample was then divided into three groups, based on T2D self-report, HbA1C, and fasting glucose (no diabetes or ND, at risk for diabetes or RD, and probable diabetes or PD). These were compared to determine the various associated risks.
4:::The ALICE system combined with lung epithelial cells cultured at the ALI offers a reliable and relevant in vitro platform technology to study the effects of inhalable substances such as L-CsA under biomimetic conditions.
1:::Perfusion of hearts with extracts of <i>Ilex paraguariensis</i> (IP/mate) appears to reduce ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. To determine if oral consumption of IP/mate can provide similar cardioprotection, short-term consumption was investigated alone or in association with exercise in rats.
3:::LVDP was higher in hearts from M and E groups as well as decreased infarction sizes than others. At the end of reperfusion, dP/dt+ was increased in E and M and dP/dt- was higher in M. LVSP was higher in M and E compared to C. Protein carbonyl and TBARS levels were higher in M while SOD activity was increased in E. No differences were observed in other activities.
2:::We conducted a systematic review, by searching electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL and grey literature between 1960 and 2015. We included studies that reported modification of cardiovascular parameters or incidence/prevalence of cardiovascular outcomes, between a group of subjects exposed to HSCD relative to a non-exposed group. The threshold used to identify HSCD was 391 mg/day. We did not consider studies evaluating exposure to sodium as an active ingredient or those focusing on dialysis solutions or enteral/parenteral nutrition. Study quality was assessed using the EPHPP tool.
3:::P. jirovecii was identified in 51% (156/305) and 67% (204/305) of specimens using IFA and qPCR, respectively. The cut-off value for the qPCR that best predicted the IFA results was 78 copies/5 μl (area under ROC curve 0.92). The sensitivity and specificity of qPCR using this cut-off was 94.6% and 89.1%, respectively, compared with the IFA.
4:::Strong professional values were found to increase job satisfaction and decrease the intent to leave the job and the institution.
2:::A qualitative approach was used in this study. Data were collected from March to May 2013. Four SCI associations were selected using purposive sampling, and four focus group interviews were conducted in Northern, Central, Southern, and Eastern Taiwan. Each focus group was composed of 7-12 participants. In-depth interviews (1.5-2.5 hours) were conducted. A content analysis method was adopted for data analysis.
3:::Thirty-eight participants took part in the study. The long-term care needs of clients with SCI require the following dynamic processes for rebuilding their lives: physical care and complication prevention, life planning, social support, discovery of the value of existence, and sexual satisfaction.
4:::Stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of the anus outcomes are poor, but first-line chemotherapy can enable good response rates. Other treatment modalities, including surgery, radiotherapy, and thermoablation, should be considered, because they may provide a survival advantage. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A336.
3:::The overall incidence of maternal acidosis was 38% in NS and 29% in RL (relative risk, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.66; P = .04). Thirty-two percent of parturients in NS experienced a drop in venous pH below 7.32 postoperatively, compared with 19% in RL (relative risk, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-2.31; P = .003). The comparative drop in base excess postoperatively below -3 between the 2 groups was not statistically significant. There were no significant differences in the incidence of maternal 24-hour postoperative morbidity events and neonatal outcomes between the 2 groups.
2:::From gentamicin-treated critically ill patients, dosing information, clinical parameters, and serum concentrations were collected prospectively. A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model was developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling to estimate Cmax after each dose. To evaluate the usefulness of routine TDM, percentages of Cmax within (%Cther, 15-20 mg/L), above (>20 mg/L), and below (%Csubther, <15 mg/L) the therapeutic range after the 1st and 2nd dose were compared. Additionally, simulations were performed to evaluate the impact of TDM.
3:::Although no significant differences were identified in BP after the control session, after the experimental session, the trained participants presented lower values than the sedentary participants for systolic (124.1±6.3 vs. 133.4±5.2 mmHg, P<0.01) and diastolic BP (73.1±4.4 vs. 85.5±6.4 mmHg, P<0.01) over the course of 12 h monitoring. For the trained participants, significant correlations were also identified (P<0.05) between the VO2peak and systolic (R=-0.68) and diastolic BP (R=-0.61) 12 h monitoring.
2:::The present study tried to dissect the role of outwardly rectifying K+ channel-1 (ORK1) (TREK-1 homolog in Drosophila) in sleep and cognition in Drosophila. The mutant and over-expressed lines of ork1 were generated using Drosophila genetics. Sleep analysis and short-term memory experiments were used to test sleep time and short-term memory of the mutant and over-expressed ORK1 lines, respectively.
3:::Dkk-1 is the target gene of miR-107. Decreased expressions of miR-107, LRP5, β-catenin, and c-Myc, and increased expressions of Dkk-1 were found in OS tissues. The Mimic and siRNA groups exhibited decreased proliferation rates, colony-forming abilities, and tumorigenicity and increased apoptosis rates, whereas the inhibitor group showed opposite trends when compared to the blank group. On the other hand, expressions of miR-107, LRP5, β-catenin, c-Myc, Caspase-3, and PARP were all elevated in the mimic group, whereas expressions of Dkk-1 and Bcl-2 were reduced; opposite trends were observed in the inhibitor group.

2:::Sedentary behavior variables (sitting, prolonged sitting, sit-to-stand transitions) were measured objectively with thigh-worn activPALs. Breast cancer risk-related biomarkers assessed were C-reactive protein, insulin, and Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and were measured in fasting plasma samples. Linear regression models were used to investigate associations between sedentary behavior variables and biomarkers (logCRP, insulin, and HOMA-IR).
3:::Sit-to-stand transitions were significantly associated with insulin resistance biomarkers (p<0.05). Specifically, each 10 additional sit-to-stand transitions per day was associated with a lower fasting insulin concentration (β:-5.52; 95%CI:-9.79,-1.24) and a lower HOMA-IR value (β:-0.22; 95%CI:-0.42,-0.03). Sit-to-stand transitions was not significantly associated with CRP concentration (p=0.08). Total sitting time, long sitting bouts, and standing time were not significantly associated with CRP, insulin, or HOMA-IR (p>.05).
4:::As the demographic shift to an older Canadian population continues, evidence of increasing overall physical activity levels across most age groups in Canada gives reason for optimism.
2:::The effects of andexanet on blood loss, anti-FXa activity, rivaroxaban unbound plasma concentrations, and other coagulation parameters were assessed in a rabbit liver laceration treatment' model. Andexanet was administered 10 min after blood loss was initiated. The toxicity of repeated administration of andexanet (up to 60 mg kg(-1)  day(-1) ) was assessed in cynomolgus monkeys. PK parameters were evaluated in rats and monkeys.'
3:::Excess blood loss due to anticoagulation with rivaroxaban was significantly decreased by a single intravenous bolus administration of andexanet at 35 and 75 mg/rabbit, by 75% and 63%, respectively. This correlated with dose-dependent decreases in the unbound fraction of rivaroxaban, and anti-FXa activity. Co-administration of rivaroxaban had no significant impact on the PK parameters of andexanet. Andexanet (up to 60 mg kg(-1)  day(-1) ) was well tolerated in monkeys, with no accumulation of andexanet or rivaroxaban. There was a single occurrence of anaphylaxis which resolved after treatment with diphenhydramine and epinephrine. There was no histological evidence of prothrombotic activity with high-dose andexanet compared with vehicle control, as measured by clot and fibrin deposition in all major organs.
3:::The association between the exposure of low 25(OH)D levels and myofascial pain was compared to all cancers, colon polyps, and tendon ruptures. The odds of having cancer with the combined exposures was 10.14 times the odds of not having either exposure (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.08, 20.25, p < 0.001). For adenomatous colon polyps, the odds ratio (OR) was 7.24 (95% CI, 3.83, 13.69, p < 0.001), and for tendon rupture, the OR was 8.65 (95% CI, 3.76, 19.94, p < 0.001). Of 80 subjects who had both myofascial pain and 25(OH)D less than 30 ng/mL, 74 were tested for red blood cell (RBC) magnesium. Half of those subjects had RBC magnesium concentrations < 4.6 mg/dL, and 23% had levels below the reference range (4.0-6.4 mg/dL).
3:::A slight increase in ΔGIR was observed with the low apelin dose (+0.65 ± 0.71 mg/kg/min, p=0.055) whereas the highest dose significantly improved insulin sensitivity (+0.82 ± 0.71 mg/kg/min, p=0.033). Cardiovascular monitoring and safety reports did not reveal any side effect of apelin administration.
4:::The analysis of explosives using PSI-MS in negative ion mode was achieved. The addition of ammonium nitrate to isopropanol, in general, enhanced the analyte signal and yielded better ionization stability. Real world explosive samples were analyzed, which demonstrates one of the potential applications of PSI-MS analysis.
2:::We created a new MIP model for IMPT with dose volume constraints. Two groups of IMPT treatment plans were generated for each of three patients by using MIP models for a total of six plans: one plan was derived with the Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) method while the other plan was derived with our MIP model with dose-volume constraints. We then compared these two plans by dose-volume histogram (DVH) indices to evaluate the performance of the new MIP model with dose-volume constraints. In addition, we developed a model to more efficiently find the best balance between tumor coverage and normal tissue protection.
3:::Three focus groups were conducted, involving a total of 12 foster carers. Eight of the 12 participants had fostered children for more than 10 years and they were currently fostering 22 children aged five to 18 years old. Four themes emerged from within the context of the supportive and nurturing foster family environment that described how foster carers responded to and managed the oral health of their foster children. Foster carers had adopted an oral health caregiving role, ""in loco parentis"" responding to the poor oral health of their vulnerable foster children. They were hypervigilant about establishing and monitoring children's oral health routines and taking their children to see a dentist; these were seen as an integral part of being good foster carers. They were knowledgeable about the causes of children's oral ill health, gained from their own dental experiences and from looking after their own children. Foster carers had experienced tensions while adopting this oral health caregiving role with dentists who had refused to see younger children. Foster carers had also experienced tensions with teenage foster children who questioned their parental authority and legitimate right to set rules about smoking and healthy eating.'
1:::We intend to evaluate the expression, clinical relevance and functional role of microRNA-137 (miR-137) in human cervical cancer (CC).
2:::This was a retrospective single center observational study of all consecutive cases of bean implantation between May 2011 and April 2015.
3:::On comparing the scores obtained at various time points, the effects of anterior capsulotomy were as follows: The Y-BOCS score of the 37 patients decreased in the fifth year postoperatively (P < 0.05); 27 (73.0%) patients exhibited significant improvement (>50% decrease in the Y-BOCS score); 6 (16.2%) patients exhibited partial improvement (20-50% decrease in the Y-BOCS score); and, 4 (10.8%) patients exhibited no evident improvement (<20% decrease in the Y-BOCS score). Moreover, depression and anxiety improved among all the patients (P < 0.05). FDG-PET showed that the glucose metabolic rate had decreased in bilateral frontal cerebral lobe and basal ganglia. DTI showed that the transverse fibers in bilateral anterior limb of the internal capsule were disconnected.
4:::In patients with SSICH, mortality was found to be significantly associated with the treatment arm and the results were in favour of SM among the patients presenting with GCS 4-8, hematoma volume 31-60 ml, midline shift of more than 5 mm, and intraventricular extension of the hematoma.
3:::Thirty participants were enrolled in the study period. Ten participants (33%) had never required naloxone for an overdose in the past, 20 participants (67%) reported recent abstinence, and 12 participants (40%) reported concomitant cocaine use. Naloxone was detected in all urine drug screens. Heroin or its metabolites were detected in almost all samples (93.3%), as were fentanyl (96.7%) and its metabolite, norfentanyl (93.3%). Acetylfentanyl was identified in nine samples (30%) while U-47700 was present in two samples (6.7%). Sixteen participants self-identified fentanyl in their heroin (sensitivity 55%); participants were inconsistent in their qualitative ability to identify fentanyl in heroin.
4:::The LDG percentage in PBMCs is significantly increased in patients with SLE, DM, PM, and RA. The influence of LDGs on T lymphocytes cannot be ignored in PBMC cultures. The adherence method is a simple and easy-to-use method for removing LDGs and purifying T lymphocytes from PBMCs.
2:::A cohort of 75 ambulatory patients with DCM underwent stress treadmill echocardiography with CPX. LV contractile reserve was calculated as absolute change (ΔLVEF=LVEFpeak -LVEFrest ) and percent change (%LVEF=[(LVEFpeak -LVEFrest )/LVEFpeak) ]×100) in LVEF, circumferential and longitudinal strain (LS). Exercise capacity was measured as peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2 ) and ventilatory efficiency as the slope of minute ventilation to CO2 production (VE/VCO2 slope). Values of contractile reserve were compared to matched controls. We also explored which metric of ventricular response (absolute or percent change) was less dependent on baseline LV function.
3:::Structural validity of the APS was confirmed. Internal consistency (Cronbachs α = 0.76) was good for this unidimensional scale. Construct validity was substantiated by moderate correlations with the PEDI and PedsQL (physical), and data that supported all research hypotheses. Statistically significant differences were found in APS scores based on sex (P = 0.018), age (P < 0.001), school attendance (P < 0.001) and elder sibling (P = 0.006).'
2:::We identified all consecutive patients presenting to the Austin Heath First Seizure Clinic with MTLE and a normal MRI or MRI-evidence of hippocampal sclerosis over a 10-year period. Patients first-degree relatives and pairwise age- and sex-matched controls underwent a comprehensive epilepsy interview. Each interview transcript was reviewed independently by two epileptologists, blinded to relative or control status. Reviewers classified each subject as follows: epilepsy, specifying if MTLE; manifestations suspicious of epilepsy; or unaffected. Physiological déjà vu was noted.'
3:::The prevalence of ARD ranged between 8.6% and 32.9%. Using the definition of observed aortic root diameter/BSA >2.1 cm/m(2) , patients with nonsubarterial VSD type were more likely to have ARD (OR 5.65, 95% CI; 1.83-17.44, P=.003) than those with subarterial type, and patients with preoperative right- or noncoronary cusp prolapse (R/NCCP) were more likely to have ARD (OR 3.68, 95% CI; 1.20-11.23, P=.022) than patients without preoperative R/NCCP after adjustment for sex, age at repair (ie, shunt duration), VSD size, and postoperative follow-up period. Using the definition of absolute Valsalva diameter ≥4 cm, nonsubarterial VSD type and presence of R/NCCP were also significantly associated with ARD after adjustment for the same covariates.
4:::Intellectual disabilities services must have clear staff training strategies around death, dying and communication. More work is needed to assess the resource implications and impact on practice of different training methods and other support strategies.
3:::Two patients had high titers of anti-CASPR2 (contactin-associated protein-like 2) Abs in serum and CSF and fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of definite limbic encephalitis. Another two patients had bilateral encephalitic temporal MRI abnormalities. They also satisfied the criteria of definite limbic encephalitis, even though they had no Abs in serum or CSF. All four were in the age range of 55-70 years. They received immunotherapy and/or antiepileptic drug treatment and became seizure-free.
2:::The study included 32 children with a mean age of 58.25±9.58 months who had tongue thrust. Children were divided into two groups: The FuCT group and control group receiving classical oral motor exercises. Each group received training for 12 weeks. Oral motor assessment was performed. Chewing performance level was determined with the Karaduman Chewing Performance Scale(KCPS). Tongue thrust severity was evaluated with the Tongue Thrust Rating Scale(TTRS). The Drooling Severity and Frequency Scale(DSFS) was used to evaluate drooling severity and frequency. The evaluations were performed before and after treatment.
1:::To comprehensively evaluate both the acceleration and image-quality impacts of axial compression and its degree of modelling in fully 3D PET image reconstruction.
3:::Nighteen trials, from 1986 to October 2013, were identified by two independent authors. A total of 6344 GC patients were included in this meta-analysis, with 1148 HER2 protein overexpression or gene amplification. Comparison of 5-year survival of patients with HER2-positive status versus HER2-negative status showed that OR was 0.58 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37-0.91], and the result was significant (P = 0.02). The survival outcome of HER2 protein overexpression or gene amplification patients was worse than those with normal HER2 (HR 1.15; 95% CI 1.12-1.18; P < 0.00001). However, the difference of III-IV stage ratio between HER2-positive and HER2-negative patients was not significant (OR 1.44; 95% CI 0.95-2.18; P = 0.09) even in the subgroup analysis of Asia (P = 0.12 and Europe (P = 0.51).
2:::Among 121 consecutive THA using the same short stem, 80 THAs were enrolled. Radiographic measurements were made using anteroposterior (AP) radiographs taken immediately and at two years after surgery. The thickness of the lateral cortex at the level of the distal end of the coated surface and at 10, 20, 30, and 40 mm proximal to it were measured.
3:::Significant atrophy was noted in all regions (P < 0.001 each). In 46 cases, this presented as an intra-cortical osteolytic line (IOL). Sixty-one cases showed either an IOL or atrophy >10%. The risk of a mean reduction >20% was related to an increased operating time (odds ratio [OR] = 0.981; 0.966 < 95% confidence interval [CI] < 0.996) and lower body mass index (BMI) (OR = 1.216; 1.043 < 95% CI < 1.417). Periprosthetic fracture through the lateral cortex occurred in one case.
4:::Complications and patient-reported outcomes worsen with each reoperative ARS.
1:::Receipt of 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) is standard of care in pancreatic cancer (PC). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is increasingly utilized; however, optimal number of cycles needed alone or in combination with AC remains unknown. We sought to determine the optimal number and sequence of perioperative chemotherapy cycles in PC.
2:::Single institutional review of all resected PCs from 2008 to 2015. The impact of cumulative number of chemotherapy cycles received (0, 1-5, and ≥6 cycles) and their sequence (NAC, AC, or NAC + AC) on overall survival was evaluated Cox-proportional hazard modeling, using 6 cycles of AC as reference.
3:::A total of 522 patients were analyzed. Based on sample size distribution, four combinations were evaluated: 0 cycles = 12.1%, 1-5 cycles of combined NAC + AC = 29%, 6 cycles of AC = 25%, and ≥6 cycles of combined NAC + AC = 34%, with corresponding survival. 13.1, 18.5, 37, and 36.8 months. On MVA (P < 0.0001), tumor stage [hazard ratio (HR) 1.35], LNR (HR 4.3), and R1 margins (HR 1.77) were associated with increased hazard of death. Compared with 6 cycles AC, receipt of 0 cycles [HR 3.57, confidence interval (CI) 2.47-5.18] or 1-5 cycles in any combination (HR 2.37, CI 1.73-3.23) was associated with increased hazard of death, whereas receipt of ≥6 cycles in any sequence was associated with optimal and comparable survival (HR 1.07, CI 0.78-1.47).
4:::Our data suggest that dynamic cerebral autoregulatory response to orthostatic challenge is neither affected by autonomic dysfunction nor in neutrally mediated syncope. This study also emphasizes that RAP + CrCP model is more informative than CVRi, mainly during cerebral vasodilatory response to orthostatic hypotension.
3:::Among 5242 subjects invited to undergo screening CTC, 1312 had pre-examination consultation and 1286 ultimately underwent CTC. Among 129 subjects with a positive CTC, 126 underwent assessment colonoscopy and 67 were ultimately diagnosed with advanced neoplasia (i.e., cancer or advanced adenoma). Cost per-participant of the entire screening CTC pathway was €196.80. Average cost per-participant for the screening invitation process was €17.04 and €9.45 for the pre-examination consultation process. Average cost per-participant of the CTC execution and reading process was €146.08 and of the diagnostic assessment colonoscopy process was €24.23. Average cost per-subject with advanced neoplasia was €3777.30.
2:::We used a randomised open-label controlled crossover study design to compare three FFR options: (a) standard FFR; (b) FFR with EV; and (c) FFR with EV+AVS. Male military personnel aged between 18 and 20 years completed a questionnaire at the beginning (baseline), after two hours of standardised non-strenuous outdoor duty and after 12 hours of duty divided into two-hour work-rest cycles. Participants rated the degree of discomfort, exertion and symptoms using a five-point Likert scale. The association between outcomes and the types of FFR was assessed using a multivariate ordered probit mixed-effects model.
3:::The overall correct prediction rate of the model was 80.6%; 80.9% for children with raised scars (>1 mm) and 80.4% for children without raised scars (≤1 mm). After adjustment for other variables, each 1% increase in % total body surface area (%TBSA) of burn increased the odds of raised scar by 15.8% (95% CI = 4.4-28.5%). Raised scar was also predicted by time to healing of longer than 14 days (OR = 11.621; 95% CI = 3.727-36.234) and multiple surgical procedures (OR = 11.521; 1.994-66.566).
4:::Patient pain during IVI under topical anesthesia is mild regardless of anesthetic technique. A subconjunctival injection of 2% lidocaine could be an option for highly sensitive patients. However, with moderate level of evidence, no single anesthetic technique could be defined as the best option for IVI.
2:::Fifty-two centenarians were evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination, short version. Walking-related parameters (velocity and time spent in the 3 m walk test), grip strength and number of age-related illnesses were also measured. The relationship between cognitive scores and time spent in the three metre walk test, velocity, grip strength and number of diseases was analysed.
3:::The FISH analysis identified abnormalities in 79.0% of patients. Del(17p13) was detected in 15.0% of cases, t(4;14) in 11.5%, 1q21 gain in 37.8% and del(1p32) in 8.7%. Adding 1p32/1q21 FISH probes has enabled us to identify adverse cytogenetic profiles in 39.0% of patients without del(17p13) or t(4;14). Clonal heterogeneity was observed in 51.1% of patients as well as an increase in the number of adverse abnormalities when related clones were greater than or equal to 2 (85.1% against 45.6%).
4:::Due to the large variability in eGFR Gates, CG and MDRD, nGFR estimation using the plasma sampling technique with (99m)Tc-DTPA appears necessary while screening healthy donors for renal transplantation.'
1:::Lung metastases (LMs) and their radioiodine uptake affect prognosis in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). We herein investigate the value of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) in LMs on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) using 2-[F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-18 FDG PET/CT) in predicting short-term progression after initial I-131 therapy in DTC patients.
3:::Patients with short-term progression had significantly higher SUVmax and MTVtotal than those without. TG levels were significantly correlated with SUVmax (r = 0.21) and MTVtotal (r = 0.51) after I-131 therapy. MTVtotal showed significant association (χ(2) = 16.5, odds ratio = 0.02) with short-term progression after initial I-131 therapy and had the highest predictive value of all the putative risk factors.
2:::Community cohort of 105 000 patients from 11 general practices in Darlington, England, was used to assess AF stroke prevention strategies against 2014 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines.
3:::The risk stratification pathway was more effective than standard care and costs £2138 per QALY gained. The ICER was most sensitive to estimates of the rate of fibrosis progression and the effect of treatment on reducing this, and ranged from -£1895 to £7032/QALY. The risk stratification pathway demonstrated an 85% probability of cost-effectiveness at the UK willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000/QALY.
4:::Closed-tube homogeneous ND-NaME-PrO combined with multiplexed HRM is a convenient approach to efficiently enrich for mutations on multiple DNA targets and to enable prescreening before targeted resequencing.
2:::This observational cohort study analyzed consecutive ICH patients (n = 583) from a prospective registry over 5 years. We characterized the influence of ECL on overall outcome by propensity score matching and on conventional prognostication using receiver operating characteristic analyses. We established the max-ICH score based on independent predictors of 12-month functional outcome in maximally treated patients and compared it to existing models.
3:::In Cox proportional hazards regression models, mortality was higher for patients consuming 25-34 units of alcohol per week (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.42) and 35 units or more (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.51 to 1.94), compared with those drinking 1-7 units per week. Patterns of mortality risk were the same for men and women. Heavy drinking increased mortality risk in combination with smoking (HR 4.04, 95% CI 3.41 to 4.79) and high levels of deprivation (HR 3.01, 95% CI 2.40 to 3.79).
2:::The sample consisted of 103 community-dwelling persons aged 55 and over (mean=61years) with early-onset schizophrenia. Mean follow-up was 52.5months (range: 12-116months); 55% were men; 55% were white. We identified 21 potential predictor variables and used the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) to assess cognition.
4:::In this study, graft renal function and survival after ABOi KT were excellent, and the incidence of acute rejection was similar to that of ABOc KT. However, efforts are needed to reduce hemorrhagic and infectious complications after ABOi KT. ABOi KT can be a good strategy to overcome ABO antibody barriers and relieve donor shortage. .
3:::Interaction of any alcohol exposure with GCKR (rs780094) and A1CF (rs10821905) influenced the risk of gout in Europeans (interaction term 0.28, P = 1.5 × 10(-4); interaction term 0.29, P = 1.4 × 10(-4), respectively). At A1CF, alcohol exposure suppressed the gout risk conferred by the A-positive genotype. At GCKR, alcohol exposure eliminated the genetic effect on gout. In the Polynesian sample set, there was no experiment-wide evidence for interaction with alcohol in the risk of gout (all P > 8.6 × 10(-4)). However, at GCKR, there was nominal evidence for an interaction in a direction consistent the European observation (interaction term 0.62, P = 0.05). There was no evidence for an interaction of A1CF or GCKR with alcohol exposure in determining HU.
2:::We assessed the inhibition of compounds on the motility and/or development of exsheathed third-stage (xL3s) and fourth-stage (L4) larvae of H. contortus using a whole-organism screening assay.
3:::Comparing with Ruili County, the seasonal pattern of imported cases in Tengchong is different: Tengchong has only one peak, while Ruili has two peaks during each year. This may be due to the different cross-border behaviors of peoples in two locations. The vectorial capacity together with the imported cases and the average humidity, can well explain the local incidences of P. vivax through both LRM and GAM methods. Moreover, the maximum daily temperature is verified to be more suitable to calculate VCAP than the minimal and average temperature in Tengchong County.
4:::Unilateral R&R as reoperation presented better results for the surgical treatment of recurrent exotropia, showing a smaller exodrift pattern and higher surgical success rates compared with R&R as a primary surgery. The mean effect per millimeter (the mean dose-effect ratio, PD/mm) of R&R as reoperation was significantly greater than that of R&R as primary surgery at postoperative 6 months. These results could serve as useful guidelines in the planning of surgical correction for primary and recurrent exotropia.
2:::To identify HLA-restricted MUC1 peptides we used eight human MHC class I transgenic mouse lines, together covering more than 80% of the human population. MUC1 peptides were identified by vaccinating each line with full length MUC1 coding sequences and using an IFNγ ELIspot restimulation assay. Relevant peptides were tested in a flow cytometry-based tetramer assay and for their capacity to serve as target in an in vivo killing assay.
3:::Collected data showed that 41 plants are utilized for the treatment of hair and scalp disorders, belonging to 27 families; among them Lamiaceae and Rosaceae, which were the most commonly used. Plant oils and their fruits are the most commonly used parts. Hair loss, dandruff, split hair endings and lice treatment, are reported as the most treated disorders. The number of plant species used consisted of 19, 14, 13, and again 13 with a factor of informants consensus (Fic) for these disorders corresponding to 0.93, 0.94, 0.95 and 0.92, respectively. Fl was 100% for many plants; the highest UV value (0.84) was registered for Lawsonia inermis, which belongs to the Lythraceae family.'
2:::We retrospectively enrolled 36 patients who were treated with non-vascularised fibula reconstructions (15 SR, 21 HR) after bone tumour resection (15 malignant, 21 benign). All cases were evaluated regarding consolidation, hypertrophy at the graft-host junctions, and complications; moreover, the functional and oncological results were assessed. The mean follow-up was 8.3 years (2.1-26.6 years).
3:::Our results revealed distinct expression profiles of follicular adenomas (FAs) and infiltrative FVPTCs, whereas NIFTP samples exhibited expression profiles more similar to those of FAs (FA-like) or IFVPTCs (IFVPTC-like) depending largely on their RAS- or BRAF-mutated genotype. Considering that FNA cytology alone cannot provide a precise differential diagnosis of NIFTPs, we speculate that our classifiers, in conjunction with genotyping analysis, might be useful in the preoperative diagnostic and prognostic characterization of these tumours.
4:::Development of SIBO in PI-IBS mice was associated with reduced ICC density and increased IELs counts in the ileum. Our findings support the role of intestinal dysmotility and inflammation in the pathogenesis of SIBO in IBS and may provide potential therapeutic targets.
2:::We retrospectively analyzed data collected from seventeen patients affected by post- anoxic SE matching them with outcome scores by means of univariate statistical analysis.
3:::Sudden death was reported in 3583 patients. Such patients were older and were more often male, with an ischemic cause of heart failure and worse cardiac function, than those in whom sudden death did not occur. There was a 44% decline in the rate of sudden death across the trials (P=0.03). The cumulative incidence of sudden death at 90 days after randomization was 2.4% in the earliest trial and 1.0% in the most recent trial. The rate of sudden death was not higher among patients with a recent diagnosis of heart failure than among those with a longer-standing diagnosis.
4:::With their extensive reach within the community and their accurate understanding of community health threats, practitioners and researchers may find religious leaders to be natural allies in health-promotion and disease-prevention activities.
3:::Among the 349 hospitals in the study, high-burden hospitals treated a larger proportion of black patients than did medium- and low-burden hospitals (4.5% vs 2.4% vs 2.9%; P = .01), as well as Hispanic patients (64.8% vs 27.0% vs 22.0%; P < .001) and patients with perforated appendicitis (27.6% vs 23.6% vs 23.6%; P = .005). High-burden hospitals were less likely than medium- or low-burden hospitals to use laparoscopy (51.6% vs 60.7% vs 71.9%; P < .001). There were no differences in morbidity, length of stay, or cost. Multivariable regression analysis confirmed that high-burden hospitals were more likely than low-burden hospitals to treat perforated appendicitis (log %, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.03-0.12; P = .04) and less likely to use laparoscopy (-16.9% difference; 95% CI, -26.1% to -7.6%; P < .001), while achieving similar complication rates. Multivariable analysis also confirmed that high-burden hospitals have similar costs, despite being associated with longer length of stay (relative risk, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.09-1.26; P < .001).
2:::We retrospectively reviewed all ARDS patients who underwent an open lung biopsy which showed evidence of DAD from January 2006 to June 2015 at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Clinical data including baseline characteristics, medication, and survival outcomes were analyzed.
3:::Malaria morbidity has decreased significantly since the implementation of LLINs in Dielmo, together with ACT. However, malaria resurgences have occurred twice during the seven years of LLINs use. These resurgences occurred the first time during the third year after the introduction of LLINs (aIRR (adjusted incidence-rate ratio) [95%CI] = 5.90 [3.53; 9.88] p< 0.001) and a second time during the third year after the renewal of LLINs (aIRR [95%CI] = 5.60 [3.34; 9.39] p< 0.001). Sixty-nine percent (69%) of the nets tested for their long-lasting insecticidal activity remained effective after 3 years of use.
4:::The combination of BPO 5% gel with liquid cleanser and moisturizer SPF 30 resulted in high levels of subject satisfaction, good tolerability and treatment adherence.
2:::90 nulliparous women were allocated based on voluntarism to a training group (TG) or to a control group (CG). TG carried out a structured program with exercises for flexibility, balance and strengthening for the majority of skeletal muscles specifically for the spinal ones, between the 24th and 36th week of pregnancy. Both TG and CG were evaluated for pain at the beginning of the program (T1), at the end of the program (T2) and two months post-partum (T3). QoL was assessed at T1,T2 and T3, and PH at T1 and T3. Mann-Whitney test was utilized to compare TG and CG on each period and to compare the periods two by two.'
3:::At T1, no significant difference was found between the two groups in pain intensity (pain interference p= 0.317), QoL (p=0.18) and PH (flexibility p=0.06; walking p=0.85). At T2, women of TG had a lower intensity of pain than CG (legs (p=0.029), lower back (p<0.0001), upper back (p=0.022), pelvis (p=0.017), groins (p=0.043), lower pelvis (p= 0.009) and interference of pain (p<0.0001)). At T3, TG had a lower intensity of pain than CG, in lower back and upper back (p<0.0001) and interference of pain (p<0.0001). Best scores of QoL were observed in TG compared to CG at T2 (p<0.0001) and at T3 (p<0.0001). PH in TG compared to CG was not different between the groups in T1 but was different in in T3 (flexibility p=0.002, walking, balance, curling-ups and Ruffier p<0.0001). TG were four times less likely to have a caesarean (p=0.049) and had 4.5 hours less of labor time (p < 0.0001). No difference was observed between the TG vs CG concerning the weight (p = 0.22) and the babys size (p = 0.11).'
3:::The expected cost was lower with PP3M (4780€) compared with PP1M (5244€). PP3M had the fewest relapses (0.080 versus 0.161), hospitalizations (0.034 versus 0.065), and emergency room visits (0.045 versus 0.096) and the most QALYs (0.677 versus 0.625). In both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, PP3M dominated PP1M. Sensitivity analyses confirmed base case findings. For the primary analysis (cost-utility), PP3M dominated PP1M in 46.9% of 10,000 simulations and was cost-effective at a threshold of 30,000€/QALY gained.
4:::Our findings suggest that IHC, a hallmark of OSA, accelerates the progression of atherosclerosis, in aorta and especially in PA. This process is partly inhibited by DMB, demonstrating that microbial metabolites may serve as therapeutic targets for OSA-induced atherosclerosis.
2:::We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study.
3:::Ninety-five patients (51 EGPA, 25 MPA, 19 PAN) met inclusion criteria, were randomized and received at least 1 dose of azathioprine (n = 46) or placebo (n = 49). Comparing azathioprine vs. placebo, respectively, at M24, 47.8% vs. 49% had remission-induction failures or relapses (P = 0.86). Secondary endpoint comparisons between azathioprine and placebo arms were comparable: initial remission rates (95.7% vs. 87.8%), global numbers of relapses (44.2% vs. 40.5%) and glucocorticoid use. Two placebo-arm patients died; 22 (47.8%) azathioprine-arm and 23 (46.9%) placebo-arm patients suffered ≥1 severe adverse event(s). For EGPA patients, between-arm primary endpoint comparisons (azathioprine vs. placebo, respectively) (48% vs. 46.2%) and numbers of asthma/rhinosinus exacerbations (24% vs. 19.2%) were comparable.
2:::Consecutive PAF and PersAF patients undergoing CB-Adv for the first time were enrolled. Patients were followed with in-clinic visits including Holter ECG. Atrial arrhythmic episodes symptomatic or documented lasting more than 30 s were considered as recurrences.
3:::A total of 96 consecutive patients [77 men (80%), mean age 57.4 ± 9.9 years] were included in this analysis. About 56 (58%) patients had PAF and 40 had (42%) PersAF. The mean procedural and fluoroscopy times were 116 ± 24 and 33 ± 12 min, respectively. Procedure-related complications occurred in four (4.2%) patients.At the 12-month follow-up, after a 3-month blanking period, freedom from recurrences was achieved in 59% [confidence interval (CI): 49-69%] of patients, 62% (CI: 48-75%) in PAF, and 54% (CI: 38-71%) in PersAF group. The difference was not statistically significant at the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (P = 0.242). Cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm was less frequently needed in PAF group [5% (CI: 1-15%) vs. 25% (CI: 13-41%), P < 0.001]. Redo procedure was performed in 7% (CI: 3-15%) of patients. In the Cox regression analysis, early atrial-tachyarrhythmia recurrence was the only independent predictor of 1-year recurrence (hazard ratio 2.11, CI: 1.06-4.20, P = 0.03).
4:::The most important predictors of dysphagia are an endocrine disorder, a greater number of decompressed levels, and 2-stage surgery. At the time of both short and long-term follow-up, patients with perioperative dysphagia exhibited improvements in functional, disability, and quality-of life scores that were similar to those of patients without dysphagia.
2:::The study was subdivided in four main steps: i) optimization of primary cells isolation technique; ii) high-throughput cell morphology analysis, by imaging flow-cytometry (FC) and subsequent validation by histological analysis; iii) analysis of progenitor cell surface markers expression, by conventional FC; and iv) statistical analysis and correlation of cells morphology and phenotype with donor age.
3:::Three subsets of cells were identified based on their diameter: small (SC), large (LC) and super large cells (SLC). The frequency of SCs decreased nearly 50% with age, whereas that of LCs increased nearly 30%. Interestingly, the increased cells size was due to an enlargement of the pericellular matrix (PCM). Moreover, the expression pattern for CD90 and CD73 was a reflexion of age, where older individuals show reduced frequencies of positive cells for those markers. Nevertheless, the elevated percentages of primary positive cells for the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) marker CD146 found, even in some older donors, bring refreshed hope for the hypothetical activation of the self-renewal potential of the IVD.
1:::To explore students intentions to practice in medically underserved areas.'
3:::2689 perioperative adverse events were noted in 1980 of 72,384 anesthetics. Mean monthly adverse event case rate was 273 (95% confidence interval, 250-297) per 10,000 anesthetics. A subgroup involving 54,469 cases had 529 SAEs in 440 anesthetics; a mean monthly SAE case rate of 80 (95% confidence interval, 69-91) per 10,000 anesthetics. Cardiac, respiratory, and airway events predominated. Relative to WUS peer members, our institution is a high-reporting outlier. The rate of incident reporting per 10,000 anesthetics was sustainably increased from 149 ± 35 to 387 ± 73 (mean ± SD) after implementing mandatory IRS data entry and Intervention 5 quality improvement initiative. Barriers to reporting included concern for punitive repercussions, feelings of incompetence, poor education about what constitutes an event, lack of feedback, and the perception that reporting had no value. These were addressed by IRS education, cultivation of a culture of safety where reporting is encouraged, reporter feedback, and better inclusion of anesthesiologists in patient safety work.
4:::Novel measures of the stenotic MV 3DOA in patients with rheumatic heart disease are significantly smaller than calculated values obtained by conventional methods and may be consistent with a higher incidence of severe MS compared to 2D techniques. Further investigation is warranted to determine the clinical relevance of 3D echocardiographic techniques used to measure MV area.
2:::A single-arm trial assessing the feasibility of hyaluronidase-assisted subcutaneous resuscitation for the treatment of moderately to severely dehydrated individuals in western Kenya was conducted. Children aged 2 months or older who presented with moderately to severely dehydration clinically warranting parenteral rehydration and had at least 2 failed IV attempts were eligible. Study staff received training on standard dehydration management and hyaluronidase infusion processes. Children received all other standards of care. They were monitored from presentation and through discharge, with a 1-week phone follow-up. Predischarge surveys were completed by caregivers, and semistructured interviews with providers were performed.
3:::The histological study of the nephrectomy specimen showed a renal papillary carcinoma in the context of acquired renal cystic disease after surgery for a WS.
2:::10 patients (age 45-58) are selected, presenting from class 4 to 5 by Cawood and Howell of jaws. Those underwent piezosurgical split-crest technique and simultaneous implants surgery and bone grafts. Pre-operative x-ray evaluation included standard x- panoramic and CT Dental-scan. Standard chemoprophylaxis was administered to each patient. The piezosurgical split-crest procedure was combined with tissue bank fresh frozen chips and double-layer collagen membrane to improve the thickness of alveolar bone and simultaneous implant surgery. Every patient received simultaneously from 3 to 6 implants which diameter was 4.3 mm and lengt 10-11.5 mm. Healing abutments have been applied at 5 months from the first procedure.
3:::Most patients (74.2%) had VI prior to surgery. A pterional craniotomy (97%) facilitated subtotal tumor removal in 71% of the patients with no intraoperative and a low rate (6.4%) of postoperative complications. Adjunctive radiotherapy was performed in 19.3% of the patients. Preoperative visual acuity was preserved or improved in 92% of the patients. Substantial tumor regrowth occurred in only 11.2% of the patients.
4:::Intradural decompression of the OC stabilizes visual function in subtotally resected skull base meningiomas. Moreover, adjuvant radiotherapy seems to further benefit visual outcome which has to be evaluated in further prospective studies.
3:::There is growing co-occurrence of obesity-related cancers and diabetes, necessitating the use of effective therapies with the least amount of side effects for concurrent management of these disease, by targeting potentially shared PPARγ-dependent mechanisms including abnormalities of the wnt/β-catenin, lysosomal acid lipase, inflammatory and cell cycle pathways, and the plasminogen activator system. Taking advantage of the multiple docking sites of the PPARγ and the pleiotropic nature of its signaling, structure-activity relationship and molecular docking studies have provided insights into designer PPARγ agonists or dual PPARα/γ agonists that modulate PPARγ signaling and negate side effects of full PPARγ agonists.
2:::We retrospectively reviewed 1,504 patients with COPD in a Korean COPD Subtype Study cohort. The occurrence of ACO was defined as a positive response to a bronchodilator (an increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] of 12% and 200 mL).
4:::We have developed an ELISA system for the quantification of the group 3 buckwheat allergen, Fag e 3, specifically. This assay will be useful for standardization of buckwheat allergens and monitoring of buckwheat contamination in foods.
1:::Nasal cytology is important in the diagnosis and treatment of nasal inflammatory diseases. Treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR) according to nasal cytology has not been fully studied. We plan to explore the individualized treatment of AR according to nasal cytology.
3:::The final sample consisted of 1865 stopped blood donors. Of the stopped blood donors, 28·4% reported that negative physical experiences were (partly) the reason to stop. This stopping reason was more often reported by women than men, those aged 19-33 years compared to older groups and those who had donated five times or less compared to those with more donations. Inconvenient opening times (26·1%) was a stopping reason more frequently reported by men compared to women, those aged 34-50 years compared to their younger and older counterparts and those who had donated more than five times.
2:::All adults of working-age (18-64 years), discharged from a Level I trauma center between 2010-2013 after sustaining a moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury were considered. Functional recovery was assessed during a telephone interview with the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended 12-36 months post-injury. A subgroup completed the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and a face-to-face interview about resilience.
3:::Our search yielded 31 unique articles, after extensive screening for relevance and duplicates. Through our analysis, we were able to identify several themes in a majority of the texts. Almost every article gave descriptive information about the chimera experiment with details about the study findings. All of the articles mentioned the benefits of the study, citing both immediate- and long-term goals, which included creating transplantable human organs, disease and drug development, and personalized medicine, among others. Some of the articles highlighted some ethical, social, and health concerns that the study and its future implications pose. Many of the articles also offered reassurances over the concerns brought up by the experiment.
2:::We prospectively collected results of the self-administered International Index Erectile Function Questionnaire 1-5 and 15 (IIEF 1-5 and 15) of 532 consecutive patients who underwent RALP for prostate cancer in our institution between October 2007 and December 2015. Patients were divided into two groups according to Floseal(®) application after prostatectomy. They were enrolled according to the following criteria: (a) bilateral nerve-sparing procedure; (b) preoperative IIEF ≥ 17; adherence to our erectile rehabilitation protocol; (c) 1-year follow-up. Outcomes were measured as mean IIEF score, EFR (IIEF < 17 or ≥17), grade of ED: severe (IIEF < 17), moderate (17-21), mild (22-25) and no ED (>25).
4:::Meeting or exceeding PA guidelines was associated with higher HRQOL. Although the BF findings are exploratory, they suggest women may benefit from increased PA, whereas men with ostomies may face challenges that require more study. Identifying PA strategies that will lead to improved patient compliance and benefit are needed.
3:::The bony fusion took place before the 18th year of life in both epiphyses. The Mann-Whitney U test results imply significant sex-related differences for most stages. For both epiphyses, the intra observer (κ femur 0.961; tibia 0.971) and interobserver (κ femur 0.941; tibia 0.951) agreement levels were very good.
2:::A retrospective study was conducted from August 2015 to July 2016. Fifty-nine patients (65 breasts, 112 lesions) with BI-RADS, 5th edition 4 or 5 assessment in mammography and/or ultrasound of the breast received an additional non-contrast CBBCT. Independent double blind reading by two radiologists was performed for mammography and CBBCT imaging. Sensitivity, specificity and AUC were compared between the modalities.
3:::A final analysis of 1720 subjects (707 patients with BM and 1013 patients without BM) was performed from 16 cohort studies. From the pooled data in the meta-analysis, the total alkaline phosphatase (TALP) (104.35 U/l [95% CI 33.36-175.34]), bone-specific ALP (BALP) (13.24 μg/l [95% CI 8.50-17.98] or 6.84 U/l [95% CI 2.98-10.70]), C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP) (5.07 μg/l [95% CI 3.58-6.56]) and N-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (NTX) (5.08 nM bone collagen equivalent/l [95% CI 2.82-7.33]) were significantly lower among BM patients than non-BM patients. Subgroup analyses detected that the serum level of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b was significantly reduced in Caucasian patients with BM (-0.64 U/l [95% CI -1.02 to -0.25]), while increased in Asian patients with BM (2.69 U/l [95% CI 0.08-5.31]), compared to patients without BM.
4:::Findings suggest that MVPA may be associated with greater executive function and working memory in BCSs. Further, this effect may be partially indirect through cancer-related symptoms (e.g., fatigue). Results emphasize the need for additional scientific investigation in the context of prospective and efficacy trials.
2:::From 50 patients, SDCT datasets PolyE and MonoE at 70 and 40 keV levels were reconstructed and best individual window width and level (BI-W/L) manually assessed. Through regression analysis, the so-called optimized individual (OI-W/L) values were obtained. Subjective image quality parameters and vessel diameters were measured to determine influences of different W/L settings.
1:::The purpose of this review is to comprehensively review the foramina of Luschka in regard to their discovery, embryology, anatomy, and surgical relevance.
3:::Long-term feeding of fructose in combination with SFA or TFA induced hepatic steatosis of similar extent associated with upregulation of stearoyl CoA desaturase-1. In contrast, fructose in combination with TFA induced NASH with fibrosis as evidenced by upregulation of hepatic proinflammatory cytokine and fibrogenic gene expression, increased hepatic oxidative stress and adipocytokine imbalance. Histopathological analysis revealed the presence of NASH with fibrosis. Further, peanut oil prevented the development of NAFLD in fructose-fed rats.
2:::Data from patients who underwent herniorrhaphy under LA or spinal anaesthesia (SA) by the 6th and 7th Forward Surgical Team were prospectively collected. All of the patients benefited from a transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block for postoperative analgesia. Primary endpoints concerned the pain response and conversion to general anaesthesia. Secondary endpoints concerned the complication and recurrence rates. Predictors of LA failure were then identified.
3:::Mean (standard deviation, s.d.) maternal 25(OH)D was 41.1 (14.2) nmol/l at a mean (s.d.) of 13.2 (5.5) weeks gestation. After adjustment for potential confounders, the first (Q1) and second (Q2) quartiles of 25(OH)D, compared to the fourth (Q4), were associated with lower birth weight for gestational age z-scores (-0.43 units; CI -0.79, -0.07; P=0.02 for Q1 and -0.56 units; CI -0.89, -0.23; P=0.001 for Q2). Q1 compared to Q4 was associated with higher 1-year weight-for-length z-scores (0.78 units; 0.08, 1.54; P=0.04) and higher 3-year BMI z-scores (0.83 units; 0.11, 0.93; P=0.02). We did not observe associations between maternal 25(OH)D and methylation for any of the 9 DMRs after correcting for multiple testing.
4:::Internet hospitals provide convenient outpatient service delivery. However, many of the Internet hospitals are not yet mature and are faced with various issues such as online doctor scarcity and the unavailability of health insurance coverage. Chinas Internet hospitals are heading in the right direction to improve provision of health services, but much more remains to be done.'
2:::A two-stage workflow was proposed using determinant framework. The development guideline includes the selection of three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics technologies and tools, the modeling of physical aspects, the design of rehabilitation scenarios, and the implementation of the proposed scenarios. The evaluation guideline consists of the definition of evaluation metrics, the execution of the evaluation campaign, the analysis of user results and feedbacks, and the improvement of the designed game.
3:::Nein men and 5 women, with a mean age 60.7 years, were included. The mean follow-up (FU) was 28.5 months; 9 patients had basilar impression whereas 5 had a degenerative pannus. The quality of anterior decompression was excellent in all cases; nonetheless a posterior stabilization was deemed necessary in 13 patients, and no external orthosis was used during the postoperative course. No tracheostomy or gastrostomy were required after surgery; no deaths, no new neurological deficits/complications, and no postoperative CSF leak were recorded. At FU the neurological status assessed with Frankel grade did not deteriorate in any of the patients, but improved in 13 of them; and no new listhesis was ever demonstrated on neuro-radiological FU.
3:::For the DEM ratio parameter, improvements were found in 80-89% of the subjects. For the DEM error parameter, improvements were found in 100% of the subjects. Incorporation of the auditory feedback component revealed a trend toward enhanced performance. The findings were similar for both DEM parameters, as well as for incorporation of the auditory feedback, in both diagnostic groups.
2:::This is a retrospective review of clinical and pathologic data. Age, stage at presentation, and outcomes of patients at our institution were compared with those of 2 large MF cohorts that predominantly were CD4(+) from the relevant literature.
4:::The application of technology and data-driven tools to advanced surgical practice has the potential to improve decision making quality, service quality and patient safety.
1:::To detect macular perfusion defects in glaucoma using projection-resolved optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography.
3:::Focal capillary dropout could be visualized in the SVC, but not the ICP and DVP, in glaucomatous eyes. In the glaucoma group, the SVC and all-plexus retinal VD (mean ± standard deviation: 47.2%±7.1% and 73.5%±6.6%) were lower than in the normal group (60.5%±4.0% and 83.2%±4.2%, both P < 0.001, t test). The ICP and DCP VD were not significantly lower in the glaucoma group. Among the overall macular VD parameters, the SVC VD had the best diagnostic accuracy as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC). The accuracy was even better when the worse hemisphere (inferior or superior) was used, achieving an AROC of 0.983 and a sensitivity of 96.7% at a specificity of 95%. Among the glaucoma participants, the hemispheric SVC VD values were highly correlated with the corresponding GCC thickness and VF sensitivity (P < 0.003). The reflectance compensation step in VD calculation significantly improved repeatability, normal population variation, and correlation with VF and GCC thickness.
4:::The Questionnaire on Infant Feeding is a construct-valid tool to measure duration, intensity, and mode of infant HM consumption and duration of maternal HM production that is reliable within 19 to 35 months postpartum. Criterion-validity testing of these questions will improve the utility of the Questionnaire on Infant Feeding as a surveillance tool.
2:::To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the incorporation of bevacizumab, a Markov model based on the MAPS trial, including the disease states of progression-free survival, progressive disease and death, was used. Total costs were calculated from a Chinese payer perspective, and health outcomes were converted into quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Model robustness was explored in sensitivity analyses.
3:::A total of 223 individuals were enrolled. Of these, 182 had environmental allergy profiling and at least one endoscopy while receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. Twenty-nine individuals had PPI-responsive EoE and were excluded from further analysis, leaving 123 individuals with non-PPI-responsive EoE who were further analyzed; 72 (58.5%) were complete responders and 33 (26.8%) were nonresponders. Seventeen individuals (13.8%) were partial responders (≥1 but ≤25 eosinophils per HPF) and excluded from further analysis. Nonresponders were more likely to be sensitized to perennial allergens (P = .02). There was no significant difference in response based on seasonal allergen sensitization. Individuals with mold or cockroach sensitization were more likely to fail combination diet and swallowed corticosteroid treatment (P = .02 and P = .002).
4:::This posthoc analysis found an association of elevated ProADM blood levels and 10-year all-cause mortality in a primary care cohort with respiratory tract infections. Due to the methodological limitations including incomplete data regarding follow-up information and biomarker measurement, this study warrants validation in future larger studies.
3:::Overall, there were more positive expressions of perceptions and attitudes of the community members towards the CCMm programme and the role of CHWs. The positive perceptions included among others; recognition and appreciation of services of CHWs, bringing health services to close proximity to the community, avoiding long queues in the health facilities, provision of health education that encourages good health practices, and promotion of positive health-seeking behaviour from within the communities. This programme is not without challenges as some of the negative perceptions expressed by the community members included the fact that some clinicians doubt the capacity of CHWs on dispensing drugs in the community, some CHWs do not keep clients secrets and mistrust of CHWs due to conflicting information by government.'
2:::This protocol describes a prospective non-interventional single-arm clinical study. Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer undergoing preoperative CRT will prospectively undergo multi-parametric MRI pre-CRT, week 3 CRT, and post-CRT. The protocol consists of DWI using a read-out segmented sequence (RESOLVE), and DCE with pre-contrast T1-weighted (VIBE) scans for T1 calculation, followed by 60 phases at high temporal resolution (TWIST) after gadoversetamide injection. A 3-dimensional voxel-by-voxel technique will be used to produce colour-coded ADC and K(trans) histograms, and data evaluated in combination using scatter plots. MRI parameters will be correlated with surgical histopathology. Histopathology analysis will be standardized, with chemoradiotherapy response defined according to AJCC 7th Edition Tumour Regression Grade (TRG) criteria. Good response will be defined as TRG 0-1, and poor response will be defined as TRG 2-3.
3:::Of the 1845 respondents, 59% was female. Based on self-reported PA, one in three respondents (35%) did not meet the PA guidelines of at least 150 min of moderate intensity PA per week. The three leading motivating factors for both women and men were to prevent health problems, to feel good and to lose weight. Women were more likely than men to be motivated by improving appearance (OR 2.93, 95%CI 2.07-4.15), spending time with others (1.76, 1.31-2.37), meeting friends (1.76, 1.31-2.36) or losing weight (1.74, 1.12-2.71). The three leading context preferences for both women and men were for activities close to home, at low cost and that could be done alone. Women were more likely than men to prefer activities that are with people of the same sex (OR 4.67, 95%CI 3.14-6.94), supervised (2.79, 1.94-4.02), with people the same age (2.00, 1.43-2.78) and at a fixed time (1.42, 1.06-1.91). Women were less likely than men to prefer activities that are competitive (OR 0.32, 95%CI 0.22-0.46), are vigorous (0.33, 0.24-0.47), require skill and practice (0.40, 0.29-0.55) and done outdoors (0.51, 0.30-0.86).
2:::A cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2015, involving randomly selected persons living in the six sub-villages of the Kilangali village, namely Mlegeni, Kisiwani, Makuruwili, Kwamtunga, Upogoroni and Chamwino. A finger prick blood sample was obtained for diagnosis of malaria infection using Giemsa-stained thick smears and a rapid malaria diagnostic test. Study participants were also screened for haemoglobin levels and a total of 570 children aged ≤ 12 years of age were examined for spleen enlargement using the palpation method.
4:::UFE is associated with clinically useful and statistically significant symptom relief in Black African patients. Symptom improvement following UFE is not compromised by a large fibroid burden and the rate of subsequent intervention is within an acceptable range. UFE is a safe alternative and efforts are needed to widen access to this non-surgical treatment modality.
3:::We found that the labor force participation rate is lower and unemployment higher for patients with IBD compared to the general population. Factors associated with unemployment in the IBD sample are older age, female gender, and the prevalence of depression.
2:::In this retrospective study; we reviewed haemodialysis registers and charts of 116 patients dialyzed from January 2013 to June 2015 at The UDOM haemodialysis unit. Data were descriptively and inferentially analysed using Stata version 11 software.
4:::In a sample of 100 Puerto Rican Hispanic patients on clopidogrel, 35% had HTPR. Furthermore, DM, PPIs and CCBs predicted HTPR. Clinical outcome data are needed to identify appropriate PRU thresholds for risk prediction in the Puerto Rican population.
3:::Forensic participants were more likely to be male and Caucasian, and reported higher ages, more years of professional experience, and a higher prevalence of board certification. While characteristics of their professional and forensic practice varied, forensic participants reported spending most of their professional time conducting neuropsychological assessments with adult clients in a private or group practice setting, focusing on civil referrals and civil legal questions involving older adult issues, developmental issues, head injury, and psychiatric issues. Common test use across neuropsychological assessment domains is presented for board-certified forensic participants (n = 77). An examination of these results reveals that the current pattern of test use is similar to the results of a more general survey of neuropsychological test use.
2:::We analyzed data from 3,080 individuals on physical health (number of chronic diseases, subjective health status, and subjective evaluation of change in health over the last 10 years), frequency of participation in 18 leisure activities, and physical and psychological well-being using moderated mediation models with a path model approach that allowed the simultaneous estimation of all model paths, including their significance.
3:::Of 2,475 images, 76.2% of the Smartscope nonmydriatic images, 90.1% of the Smartscope mydriatic images, and 92.0% of the Topcon mydriatic images were gradable. Eyes with vitreous hemorrhage (OR = 0.24, p < 0.0001) or advanced cataract (OR = 0.08, p < 0.0001) had decreased odds of image gradability. Excluding eyes with cataract or vitreous hemorrhage, nonmydriatic macular image gradability improved from 68.4% in the first set of 55 eyes to 94.6% in the final set of 55 eyes.
3:::Among the 1932 articles identified, one RCT and four NRS were eligible. Very low certainty in the body of evidence across examined studies suggests that Vitamin D supplementation for pregnant women, breastfeeding women and infants may not decrease the risk of developing allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis (in pregnant women), allergic rhinitis (in pregnant women, and infants), asthma and/or wheezing (in pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and infants), or food allergies (in pregnant women). We found no studies of primary prevention of allergic diseases in children.
2:::Prospective multi-center cohort study of HNC patients receiving Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) or more advanced RT. Stimulated whole salivary flow, maximal mouth opening, oral mucositis, oral pain, oral health-related quality of life (OH-QOL), and oral hygiene practices, were measured in 372 subjects pre-RT and 216 at 6 months from start of RT.
4:::Despite advances in RT techniques, HNC patients experience oral complications 6 months after RT, with resulting negative impacts on oral function and quality of life. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
3:::Between 2000 and 2012, 27 patients with primary BCS presented with a median Rotterdam score of 1.16 (range 0.07 - 2.11). Twenty-four patients (89%) had at least one risk factor, with the commonest being Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN), detected in 17/24 (71%) of the tested patients, including 4 patients with normal blood counts at diagnosis. All patients were anticoagulated with warfarin or Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH). 25 (92.6%) patients also had primary radiological interventions, consisting of TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) in 18 (67%) patients and/or angioplasty/stenting in 11 (40%). Fourteen patients developed TIPS stenoses requiring a median of 1.5 (range 1-14) revisions. No patient developed TIPS failure requiring alternative therapy. Two patients were lost to follow up. At a median follow up of 59 months (range 2 to 248 months), the overall survival was 96% at one year and 81% at five years, much greater than predicted by the Rotterdam score. No patients required liver transplantation.
2:::We have investigated the effect of various voltages and tin filtration combinations on the SPR map accuracy and precision, and the influence of the dose allocation between the low energy (LE) and the high energy (HE) acquisitions. For all spectra combinations, virtual CT projections of the Gammex phantom were simulated with a realistic energy-integrating detector response model. Two situations were simulated: an ideal case without noise (infinite dose) and a realistic situation with Poisson noise corresponding to a 20 mGy total central dose. To determine the optimal dose balance, the proportion of LE-dose with respect to the total dose was varied from 10% to 90% while keeping the central dose constant, for four dual-energy spectra. SPR images were derived using a two-step projection-based decomposition approach. The ranges of 70 MeV, 90 MeV and 100 MeV proton beams onto the adult female (AF) reference computational phantom of the ICRP were analytically determined from the reconstructed SPR maps.
3:::There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of patient characteristics before the study. All the end-points in the glutamine F group were significantly lower than those in the glutamine-fiber-oligosaccharide group.
2:::All patients from 20 Dutch hospitals undergoing hip or knee surgery in 2014 were invited to a PROMs survey. Participants were asked to rate the importance of each of the items in the HOOS-Physical Function Short form or the KOOS-Physical Function Short form, the EQ-5D and the NRS pain.
4:::Electric dipoles can be advantageous at ultrahigh fields because they can produce both curl-free and divergence-free currents, whereas loops are limited to divergence-free contributions only. Combining loops and dipoles may be optimal for body imaging at 3 T, whereas arrays of loops or dipoles alone may perform better at lower or higher field strengths, respectively.

3:::Adolescents reported that staff were generally friendly (>80%) and respectful (>90%) and that they trusted staff to care for them (90%). Explanations were considered clear by 87% of adolescents, but 20% felt uncomfortable asking questions. Confidentiality was discussed with some adolescents (52%). Privacy was provided (93%), and most adolescents (86%) were satisfied with the extent of their involvement in consultations. Adolescents reported that staff did not routinely undertake psychosocial assessments. The physical environment and resources did not always meet the needs of adolescents, with 70% complaining about a lack of access to other adolescents.
3:::Results confirmed good psychometric qualities of the questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analyses evidenced a unidimensional structure of the GAS-I, in accordance with other validated versions. Convergent and discriminant validity were highly satisfactory. The three-factor model also provided an acceptable fit to the data. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses revealed good discriminatory power of the GAS-I.
1:::Non-dipping nocturnal blood pressure (BP) pattern has been reported prevalent among HIV-infected patients and is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The aims of this observational study were to identify predictors of nocturnal BP decline, and to explore whether diurnal BP profile is associated with alterations in cardiac structure and function.
2:::We develop and illustrate our approach for eliciting expert opinion with the IMPROVE trial (ISRCTN 48334791), an ongoing multi-centre randomised controlled trial which compares an emergency endovascular strategy versus open repair for patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. In the IMPROVE trial at 3 months post-randomisation, 21% of surviving patients did not complete health-related quality of life questionnaires (assessed by EQ-5D-3L). We address this problem by developing a web-based tool that provides a practical approach for eliciting expert opinion about quality of life differences between patients with missing versus complete data. We show how this expert opinion can define informative priors within a fully Bayesian framework to perform sensitivity analyses that allow the missing data to depend upon unobserved patient characteristics.
4:::No advantage of NeoTMZ was noted for the overall study population or subgroup of GBM, while NeoTMZ resulted in 5 years longer median survival for patients diagnosed as AA.
3:::In the non-operated group, the most common reason for no surgery was patient refusal (n=64). Eleven patients were considered to have achieve clinical complete response (cCR), which was an independent prognostic factor of progression-free survival (PFS) (p = 0.045). In patients with disease progression in the non-operated group, the overall survival did not improved according to salvage treatments (p = 0.451). The non-operated group showed worse survivals compared to the TLE or TME group before and after matching (p < 0.001). This finding was also noted in the analysis of survival only in patients with cCR.
2:::Consecutive patients with UC referred to our inflammatory bowel disease unit for colonoscopy were enrolled. Patients without UC were used as controls. UC activity was evaluated by white light endoscopy and classified according to the Mayo Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Score of Severity. Endoscopic biopsies were also taken for histological assessment of disease activity and then assessed with CLE. Three parameters were evaluated; crypt architecture (crypt diameter, inter-crypt distance, presence of fused crypts, crypts regularity), microvascular pattern (regular, dilated, irregular and deformed), fluorescein leakage.
3:::Twenty-four (86%) from ten different countries completed the survey. Overall prevalence of TC was: 21% unknown, 46% below 15, and 29% between 15 and 30%. Ninety-six agreed on screening all patients for TC regardless the type of ARM and 79% start screening at birth. Responses varied in TC definition and diagnostic tools. Fifty percent of respondents prefer ultrasound (US), 21% indicate either US or magnetic resonance (MRI) based on a pre-defined risk of presenting TC, and 21% perform both. Discrepancy exists in complementary test: 82% carry out urodynamic studies (UDS) and only 37% perform somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP). Prophylactic untethering is performed in only two centers (8%).
4:::This extended follow-up confirms the initial results for TPRA as an excellent treatment option for highly recurrent AS after RRP. Postoperative SUI as a consequence of transsphincteric urethral mobilization can be satisfactorily treated by the implantation of AUS. In case of AS recalcitrant to endoscopic treatment, the described procedure-even though technically challenging-represents a valuable treatment option.
2:::A randomised, prospective, double-blinded study was conducted on 277 eyes of 257 patients who underwent phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Patients were divided into three groups based on the medication administered after cataract surgery as follows: FCBT, FCBZT and a control group where no antiglaucoma medications were used. IOP was recorded at preoperative and postoperative hours 6 and 24 and days 3 and 5.
3:::The electronic search resulted in 5482 potentially eligible studies. Forty-five studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 22 in obstetrics and 23 in gynaecology. Twenty-seven (60%) studies did not adhere to 50% (n = 10) or more of the reporting quality items and 32 studies (71%) did not meet 50% (n = 4) or more of the statistical quality items. As for the statistical quality, no study used the appropriate method to assess cost differences, no advanced methods were used to deal with missing data, and clustering of data was ignored in all studies. No significant improvements over time were found in reporting or statistical quality in gynaecology, whereas in obstetrics a significant improvement in reporting and statistical quality was found over time.
1:::To evaluate the frequency of emergency diseases that were detected unexpectedly using FDG-PET/CT.
2:::We reviewed all cases of hypertension in premature infants referred from 18 hospitals over 16 years. Inclusion criteria were hypertension occurring at <6 months of age and birth at <37 weeks gestation; the main exclusion criterion was known secondary hypertension. Continuous variables were compared using analysis of variance. Nominal variables were compared using chi-square tests.
3:::Ten out of fourteen trials assessing BMD and dietary protein quantity in humans and 3/4 in animal trials found a positive relationship between these two parameters. Four out of seven trials investigating the relationship between dietary protein quantity and fracture risk displayed a positive, protective effect of dietary protein levels on fracture risk. Sixty-two percent of studies used the Food-Frequency Questionnaire assessment method.
4:::Salt delays puberty and prevents the obesogenic effect of a high fat diet. The reduced weight gain evident in high salt fed animals is not due to differences in food intake or digestive efficiency.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 04 July 2017. doi:10.1038/ijo.2017.154.
3:::At 20 weeks, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, blood pressure, and renal function were not significantly different among the six groups. Serum calcium and phosphate levels tended to be higher in SDT-Nx rats than in SD-Nx rats. The urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate was significantly greater in SDT-Nx rats than in SD-Nx rats. After administering paricalcitol, serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels were significantly higher in SDT-Nx rats than in SD-Nx rats. The degree of aortic calcification was significantly more severe and the aortic calcium content was significantly greater in SDT-Nx rats than in SD-Nx rats.
2:::Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels were measured in blood samples collected at baseline (n=6377). Mortality was ascertained from the Norwegian National Registry. Cox regression models were applied to estimate the HRs with 95% CIs for all-cause mortality in association with serum 25(OH)D levels after adjustment for a wide spectrum of confounding factors as well as chronic diseases at baseline.
3:::The prevalence of DPN was 7% in youth with T1D and 22% in youth with T2D. Risk factors for DPN in youth with T1D were older age, longer diabetes duration, smoking, increased diastolic blood pressure, obesity, increased LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and lower HDL cholesterol (HDL-c). In youth with T2D, risk factors were older age, male sex, longer diabetes duration, smoking, and lower HDL-c. Glycemic control over time was worse among those with DPN compared with those without for youth with T1D (odds ratio 1.53 [95% CI 1.24; 1.88]) but not for youth with T2D (1.05 [0.7; 1.56]).
4:::A new inpatient addiction consultation service diagnosed and treated hospitalized patients with substance use disorders and linked them to outpatient addiction treatment care. Initiating addiction medications, particularly opioid agonists, was feasible in the inpatient setting. Optimal linkage and retention of hospitalized patients to post-discharge addiction care warrants further innovation and program development.
2:::This retrospective observational study was based on data from a cohort including all patients offered continuous positive airway pressure therapy in the course of a 14-month period after being referred to a sleep disorders clinic.
3:::A total of 54 of 696 (7.8%) patients had type 2 DM. The majority of the patients in the type 2 DM group were referred from a general practitioner and only 8% from diabetes clinics. BMI, age and cardiovascular morbidity in type 2 DM patients were significantly higher than in the group without diabetes, while the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score, the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) and the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) were not statistically different. Daytime sleepiness was similar in patients with mild-to-moderate compared with severe OSA.
2:::We compared gene expression profiles in stromal fields of breast carcinomas by performing laser capture microdissection of the cancer-associated stroma from eight old (aged ≥80 years at diagnosis) and nine young (aged <45 years at diagnosis) patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Gene expression data were obtained by microarray analysis (Affymetrix). Differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed.
3:::Differential gene expression analysis showed changes reminiscent of increased growth, de-differentiation and migration in stromal samples of older versus younger patients. GSEA confirmed the presence of a SASP, as well as the presence of autophagy in the stroma of older patients.
4:::We provide the first evidence in humans that older age at diagnosis is associated with a different stromal micro-environment in breast cancers. The SASP and the presence of autophagy appear to be important age-induced stromal features.
3:::Overall, 1041 MERAFs were collected and data from 932 MERAFs were included for analysis. Patients with unresectable Stage IIIB/IV nonsquamous NSCLC had a median age of 59 years, 56.4% were male, 58.2% were never smokers, 95.0% had adenocarcinoma, and 92.9% had an ECOG PS ≤1. A total of 665 (71.4%) patients had gene aberration tests; 46.5% (309/665) had epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations, 11.5% (48/416) had anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fusions, and 0.8% (1/128) had a c-ros oncogene 1 gene fusion. The most common first-line treatment regimen for unresectable Stage IIIB/IV nonsquamous NSCLC was chemotherapy (72.5%, 676/932), followed by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; 26.1%, 243/932), and TKIs plus chemotherapy (1.4%, 13/932). Most chemotherapy regimens were platinum-doublet regimens (93.5%, 631/676) and pemetrexed was the most common nonplatinum chemotherapy-backbone agent (70.2%, 443/631) in platinum-doublet regimens. Most EGFR mutation-positive patients (66.3%, 205/309) were treated with EGFR-TKIs.
2:::We determined the expression of UGT2B15, UGT2B17, and UGT2B28 enzymes in 190 prostate tissue samples from surgical specimens of a multiethnic cohort of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The association between each proteins percent positive and H-score, a weighted score of staining intensity, and the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) was tested using separate Cox proportional hazards models. In an exploratory analysis, UGT2B17 total positive and H-score were divided at the median and we tested the association between UGT2B17 group and risk of BCR.'
4:::Our findings suggest that UGT2B17 overexpression may be associated with a significant increased risk of BCR. These results are consistent with previous reports which showed UGT2B17 significantly expressed in advanced prostate cancer including prostate tumor metastases.
2:::Volunteers received navigation training through a three-day workshop and then conducted in-home visits with clients living with advanced chronic illness over one year. A nurse navigator provided education and mentorship. Mixed method evaluation data was collected from clients, volunteer navigators, the nurse navigator, and other stakeholders.
3:::Seven volunteers were partnered with 18 clients. Over the one-year pilot, the volunteer navigators conducted visits in home or by phone every two to three weeks. Volunteers were skilled and resourceful in building connections and facilitating engagement. Although it took time to learn the navigator role, volunteers felt well-prepared and found the role satisfying and meaningful. Clients and family rated the service as highly important to their care because of how the volunteer helped to make the difficult experiences of aging and advanced chronic illness more livable. Significant benefits cited by clients were making good decisions for both now and in the future; having a surrogate social safety net; supporting engagement with life; and ultimately, transforming the experience of living with illness. Overall the program was perceived to be well-designed by stakeholders and meeting an important need in the community. Sustainability, however, was a concern expressed by both clients and volunteers.
4:::Genetic variations in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5may influence LF pharmacokinetics and treatment outcome in pregnant women.
3:::A total of 213 patients were included from 41 centres in 30 nations (109 from 17 DiN and 104 from 13 DeN). 7% of DiN patients died at a median age of 5 years whereas no death was observed in DeN. DiN patients were older at the time of diagnosis. In DiN, leukocyte cystine measurement was only available in selected cases for diagnosis but never for continuous monitoring. More patients had reached end-stage renal disease in DiN (53.2 vs. 37.9%, p = 0.03), within a shorter time of evolution (8 vs. 10 yrs., p = 0.0008). The earlier the cysteamine treatment, the better the renal outcome, since the median renal survival increased up to 16.1 [12.5-/] yrs. in patients from DeN treated before the age of 2.5 years of age (p = 0.0001). However, the renal survival was not statistically different between DeN and DiN when patients initiated cysteamine after 2.5 years of age. The number of transplantations and the time from onset of ESRD to transplantation were not different in DeN and DiN. More patients were kept under maintenance dialysis in DiN (26% vs.19%, p = 0.02); 79% of patients from DiN vs. 45% in DeN underwent peritoneal dialysis.
2:::Data on district level incidences of diarrhea from 2010 to 2014 were compiled together with population data. We mapped the relative risks using empirical Bayesian smoothing. The spatial scan statistics was used to detect and map spatial and space-time clusters. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between space-time clustering and urbanization strata, i.e. rural, peri-urban, and urban districts.
4:::Among patients receiving atazanavir/ritonavir-based second line antiretroviral therapy, bilirubin levels better predicted virological failure than pill count adherence. Therefore, strategic use of bilirubin and viral load testing to target adherence counseling and support may be cost-effective in monitoring second line antiretroviral therapy adherence and virological failure. Drug resistance testing targeted for patients with virological failure despite elevated bilirubin levels would facilitate timely switch to third line antiretroviral regimens whenever available.
3:::We identified 94 probable measles cases, 10 (11%) were confirmed by positive measles-specific IgM. Of the 64 probable measles patients aged <5 years, 16 died (case-fatality rate = 25%). In the case-control study, no history of vaccination against measles was found in 94% (15/16) among the case-persons (i.e., measles patients who died) and 54% (26/48) among the controls (i.e., measles patients who survived) (ORM-H = 12; 95% CI = 1.6-104), while 56% (9/16) of case-persons and 67% (17/48) of controls (ORM-H = 2.3; 95% CI =0.74-7.4) did not receive vitamin A supplementation during illness. 63% (10/16) among the case-persons and 6.3% (3/48) of the controls (ORM-H = 33; 95% CI = 6.8-159) were not treated for measles illness at a health facility (a proxy for more appropriate treatment), while 38% (6/16) of the case-persons and 25% (12/48) of the controls (ORM-H = 2.5; 95% CI = 0.67-9.1) were malnourished.
2:::Using RNA-seq expression data, we undertook a pan-cancer classification of 9,096 TCGA tumor samples representing 31 tumor types. We randomly assigned 75% of samples into training and 25% into testing, proportionally allocating samples from each tumor type.
3:::The mean age of T1D patients was 14.33 years. The mean duration of diabetes was 4.88 years. Anti-TPO was positive in 43 (16.7%) patients with T1D as compared to 3 (3.4%) in controls. IgA tTG was positive in 12 (4.65%) patients with T1D and was absent in controls. 21-OHAb was positive in two (1.1%) patients with T1D and was absent in controls. Both patients who had positive 21-OHab had the other two antibodies. Five patients had positive anti-TPO and IgA-tTG antibodies.
4:::Anti-TPO antibody was the most prevalent antibody in patients with T1D. Anti-TPO and IgA-tTG antibodies were significantly higher than in the control population. Further studies will be required to assess the clinical significance of these positive antibodies.
2:::The influence of spherical SVL and four different designs of PALs that differ in the near zone width (PAL 1) or that have different signs and magnitude of horizontal gradients of mean power adjacent to their near vision zones (PAL 3 and PAL 4) on the accommodative response was investigated for different near viewing distances (40, 33, and 25 cm) in 31 subjects, aged 18 to 25 years.
1:::The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of computer-assisted input-based intervention for children with speech sound disorders (SSD).
3:::We found that of 85 NHs, those that received implementation training and support exhibited statistically nonsignificant reductions in hospitalization rates compared with control NHs (net difference, -0.13 per 1000 resident-days; P = .25), hospitalizations during the first 30 days after NH admission (net difference, -0.37 per 1000 resident-days; P = .48), hospitalizations during periods more than 30 days after NH admission (net difference, -0.09 per 1000 resident-days; P = .39), 30-day readmission rates (net change in rate among hospital discharges, -0.01; P = .36), and ED visits without admission (net difference, 0.02 per 1000 resident-days; P = .83). Intervention NHs exhibited a reduction in potentially avoidable hospitalizations overall (net difference, -0.18 per 1000 resident-days, P = .01); however, this effect was not robust to a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
3:::Of the 122 participants, 36 were categorized as remitters (29.5%), 56 as nonresponders (45.9%), and 30 as neither (24.6%). Predictors of remission were higher levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and IL-1B, greater depressive symptom severity, and higher postexercise positive affect. Predictors of treatment nonresponse were low cardiorespiratory fitness, lower levels of IL-6 and BDNF, and lower postexercise positive affect. Models including these predictors resulted in predictive values greater than 70% (true predicted remitters/all predicted remitters) with specificities greater than 25% (true predicted remitters/all remitters).
4:::Thalidomide treatment prevents CAV development in a rodent model and is therefore potentially useful in clinical applications to prevent post-transplant heart rejection.
2:::A genome-wide association approach was applied. A case was defined as a diabetic patient (type 1 or type 2) who had ever been recorded in the linked e-health records as having a foot ulcer (current or previous) in at least one foot as well as a positive result of the monofilament test in the longitudinal e-health records. A control in this study was defined as a diabetic individual (type 1 or type 2) who has never been recorded as having a foot ulcer in either foot in the linked e-health records and the monofilament test results of any foot was once recorded to be positive in the longitudinal e-health records.
3:::Better survival in macrophages was observed for UCN34, BAA-2069 and ATCC43143 than for DSM16831 and LMG17956. S. gallolyticus strains show high resistance to tested bactericidal agents (acid, lysozyme and hydrogen peroxide). S. gallolyticus stimulates significant lower cytokine gene expression and causes less lysis of macrophages compared to the control strain Staphylococcus aureus. S. gallolyticus reacts to oxidative burst with a higher gene expression of NADH oxidase initially at the early phase. Expression of genes involved in D-alanylation of teichoic acid, carbohydrate metabolism and transport systems were upregulated thereafter.
2:::A meta-analysis was performed to compare the incidence of neonatal congenital malformations after exposure to different antithyroid drugs during pregnancy. Twelve studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in this meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL databases were searched from inception until January 2017. Study designs included case-control studies, prospective cohort studies, and retrospective cohort studies.
4:::Limited high-quality clinimetric evidence exists for lower limb neurological impairment tests in children and young people with a neurological condition. Results of currently used neurological tests, therefore, should be interpreted with caution. Robust clinimetric evidence on these tests is required for clinicians and researchers to effectively select and evaluate rehabilitation interventions.
3:::Longer movement durations and increased APS were found with higher MACS-levels (p<0.001). Increased APS was also associated with more severe sensorimotor impairments (r = -0.30-(-0.73)) and with lower AHA and MA2-scores (r = -0.50-(-0.86)). For the joint specific parameters, stronger movement deviations distally were significantly associated with increased muscle weakness (r = -0.32-(-0.74)) and muscle tone (r = 0.33-(-0.61)); proximal movement deviations correlated only with muscle weakness (r = -0.35-0.59). Regression analysis exposed grip force as the most important predictor for the variability in APS (p<0.002).
3:::Out of the 761 GNB, Acinetobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp. and others were 27, 23 , 21 , 17 , 5  and 7 % respectively. A high prevalence of ESBL was found across all genera in these strains. The carbapenem resistance was higher in North than in South Indian GNB. The level of AmpC production was comparatively lower in both North and South Indian strains.
2:::GCF and subgingival plaque were collected from 77 patients at 3 representative sites, 1 healthy (≤ 3mm) and 2 diseased (≥ 6mm) at baseline and at 3 and 6-months post treatment. Patients received standard nonsurgical periodontal treatment at each time point as appropriate. The outcome measure was improvement in pocket depth of ≥2mm. Concentrations of active enzymes (MMP 8, elastase and sialidase) in GCF and subgingival plaque levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Fusobacterium nucleatum were analysed for prediction of the outcome measure.
4:::A growing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) literature (total N = 1,717) and a plethora of apparent findings suggest atypical interhemispheric connection in ADHD. However, FA results in ADHD should be considered with caution, since many studies did not examine potential group differences in head motion, and most of the studies reporting no difference in motion showed no significant results. Future studies should address head motion as a priority and assure that groups do not differ in head motion.
3:::Phantom measurements showed a small bias (median = -0.9 ms) and good short-term repeatability (median wCV = 0.5%). Long-term repeatability was 0.9 and 1.1% and reproducibility between systems was 1.7%. The median bias observed in patients was -1.1 ms. At voxel level, the median wCV was 15%, dropping to 4% for structures of 0.5 cm(3) . The median tumor T2 values (79 ms) were significantly lower (P < 0.001) than in the peripheral zone (149 ms), but overlapped with the transition zone (91 ms).
2:::Patients included in the National Cancer Database who were diagnosed with oral cavity cancer between 1998 and 2011 were included in the study. Data was stratified by facility where care was provided, including community cancer programs (CCP), comprehensive community cancer programs (CCCP), and academic centers (AC). Univariate analysis was performed using analysis of variance, chi squared, and log-rank test, whereas multivariate analysis was performed using Cox regression.
3:::Out of eighty patients, 54 (67.5%) died. Univariate analysis showed that age >60 years, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate, thrombocytopenia, need of mechanical ventilation, and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were variables associated with high mortality. The independent predictors of mortality identified by multivariate regression analysis were platelet count below 1 lakhs, serum levels of CRP >100, APACHE II score >25 on the day of admission to the ICU with severe sepsis, and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.
3:::Pastors expressed widely ranging opinions, especially about discussion of condom use, but generally agreed that sermons should discuss marriage, abstinence, monogamy, dating, and infidelity - behaviors that impact sexual networks and HIV transmission. The major barriers to incorporation of these subjects into sermons include the extent to which a concept undermines their religious beliefs and uncertainty about how to incorporate it. However, scriptural support for a prevention message and the pastors perception that the message is relevant to the congregation facilitate incorporation of related topics into sermons.'
4:::In this preclinical model, robotic radical perineal cystoprostatectomy and extended pelvic lympadenectomy was feasible using the SP1098 robotic platform. Further investigation is needed to assess the feasibility of urinary diversion using this novel approach and new technology. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
3:::Validation showed that the chromatographic method has good selectivity with no interfering peaks. Sensitivity, linearity, repeatability and accuracy were shown to be adequate. In analyses of several batches of H. pilosella, contents of caffeoylquinic acids ranging from 0.7 to 1.9% were found. Compared to the colorimetric method, this newly developed HPLC method is more specific and results in detection of nominally lower amounts of caffeoylquinic acid derivatives. A new acceptance limit of 1.0% instead of 2.5% caffeoylquinic acid, expressed as chlorogenic acid, for H. pilosella, is proposed when using this HPLC-method.
2:::We conducted semistructured, telephone interviews with the pediatric medical director and clinical nurse consultant from all 11 LTFU clinics at tertiary referral pediatric oncology units across ANZ (n = 19; 100% response rate). Data were analyzed using NVivo10.
3:::From the first dataset, two substantial changes of the phase relationship during anesthesia was found: (1) the dynamics of the phase relationship between frontal channels became progressively less diverse and more stereotyped during unconsciousness, quantified as a reduction in PLE; and (2) the reduction in PLE was consistent across subjects. Furthermore, PLE provided better performance in the classification of states of consciousness than did phase-lag index, a classical time-averaged connectivity method. From the second dataset, PLE showed the highest agreement with the level of consciousness, compared to existing anesthetic depth indicators.
1:::To evaluate the effect of in vitro application of pentoxifylline (PX) on sperm parameters and ultrastructure after vitrification in asthenozoospermic patients.
3::: There were 219 procedures recorded and analyzed (134 with a trainee, 85 without). Three trainees were involved. Selective biliary cannulation was achieved in 201 (92 %) of cases. When a trainee was present, cannulation was successful in 122/134 procedures (91 %), compared to 79/85 (93 %) with a senior endoscopist alone ( P  = 0.8, Fishers exact test). Mean time to biliary cannulation with a trainee present was 7 minutes, compared with 5 minutes with no trainee. Mean time for successful independent cannulation by the trainee was 4 minutes, and 9 minutes for a consultant following a trainee's attempt. There were no serious adverse events.'
2:::This systematic review was conducted based on the eight-step guidelines presented by the York University. The databases relevant to the medical field including Nursing and Allied Health, Web of Science, Scopus, Pubmed, Embase, PsycINFO and Psychology Library were used. Finally, 12 articles observing the inclusion criteria and with regard to the research questions were found. The data obtained from these articles were summarized, classified, and analyzed.
4:::POGS may be a clinically acceptable alternative to CS as a treatment to achieve stable transverse axes of the dentition in both arches in patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion and facial asymmetry.
3:::Out of 1030 women, 164 (18.9%) were detected TPO antibody positive with euthyroid status. The mean FT4 and TSH level were significantly different in those who were TPO Ab positive as compared TPO Ab negative euthyroid pregnant women. No correlation was observed between the maternal age, gestational age and gravidity with anti TPO antibody levels. Eighteen (12%) women in Group 1and 5 (3.3%) women in Group 2 had miscarriages and the difference was found to be statistically significant (P value of 0.004). Twenty-one (14%) women in Group 1 and 5 (3.3%) women in Group 2 had preterm deliveries, which was also found to be statistically significantly (p value of 0.001). Other pregnancy related complications like Intrauterine death, IUGR, preeclampsia and PIH though are present in comparatively higher number in TPO Ab positive euthyroid pregnant women as compared to TPO Ab negative euthyroid pregnant women but this difference was not found to be statistically significant.
3:::FT-IR and H-NMR analyses confirmed the synthesis of the polymer. The size of polymer was approximately 40 nm with a molecular weight (MW) of 52 kDa, which would be excellent for a nano carrier. Microscopic analyses showed that the polymer was rodshaped. This polymer had no toxicity for individual cells.
3:::The proportion of patients without rectal bleeding during the 48-week treatment period in the per protocol set was 84.8% (84/99) in the multimatrix mesalazine 2.4 g/day group and 78.0% (78/100) in the controlled-release mesalazine 2.25 g/day group. The difference between the 2 treatment groups was 6.8% (two-sided 95% confidence interval, -3.9% to 17.6%). The noninferiority margin of -10% was met in the comparison of multimatrix mesalazine 2.4 g/day once-daily with controlled-release mesalazine 2.25 g/day. Multimatrix mesalazine 2.4 g/day once-daily demonstrated consistent efficacy in all subgroups. There was no difference between the 2 treatment groups with regard to safety.
4:::A once-daily dose of 2 multimatrix mesalazine tablets (2.4 g) was not inferior to controlled-release mesalazine 2.25 g/day 3 times-daily in maintaining absence of rectal bleeding in ulcerative colitis.
2:::The International Journal of Nursing Studies, Journal of Nursing Scholarship, and Journal of Advanced Nursing were the three top-ranked nursing journals according to 2015 SNIP values. SNIP values for the selected journals were retrieved from the Scopus database, and extracted data were exported to Joinpoint trend analysis software to perform trend analysis.
3:::Before surgery, mean brown/beige adipose tissue activity and the expression of signature transcripts were similar between obese non-diabetic and obese diabetic groups. Eight months after surgery, body mass reduction was similar between the obese groups. Nevertheless, the activity of brown/beige adipose tissue was increased in obese non-diabetic and unchanged in obese diabetic subjects. This effect was correlated with a more pronounced improvement of insulin resistance, as evaluated by the hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp, in obese non-diabetic subjects as compared with obese diabetic subjects.
4:::The present findings highlight the influence of telehealth and disability status on treatment discontinuation, while minimizing the role of the previously identified variables from studies with less sensitive analyses.
2:::Hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition tests were used to determine the hemagglutination (HA) activity of the HA subtypes. The entire genomes of the viruses were sequenced on an ABI PRISM 3500xl DNA Analyzer. The sequences were genetically analysed to study their genetic evolution using DNASTAR and MEGA 6. The pathogenic effects of the viruses were evaluated using mouse infection models.
3:::Inclinations of the mandible to the true vertical and cervical column were smallest in the high angle group and largest in the low angle group. Other variables representing head posture and craniocervical posture were largest in the high angle group, smallest in the low angle group. Inclinations of ramus to cervical column were largest in the high angle group and smallest in the low angle group.
3:::The theoretical base rates obtained from the new methods were close to the observed base rates.
4:::The new methods can derive reasonable theoretical base rates and are usable practically.
3:::The intron 20 of OGT from European and Chinese pigs was 514 and 233 bp, respectively, in the pigs tested initially. They included 1 White composite (WC) boar and 7 sows (2 Minzu×WC, 2 Duroc [DU]×WC, 2 ME×WC, 1 Fengzing×WC) at USMARC. The 281-bp difference was due to an inserted 276-bp element and GACTT in European pigs. When additional WC and ME boars, the grandparents that were used to generate the 1/2ME×1/2WC parents, and the 84 boars of 16 litters from mating of 1/2ME×1/2WC parents were analyzed, the breeds of origin of X chromosome quantitative trait locus (QTL) were confirmed. The polymorphism was determined in an independent population of pigs including DU, Landrace, Yorkshire, and ME breeds at NIAS. OGT was placed at position 67 cM on the chromosome X of the USMARC swine linkage map.
2:::A model of osteoporosis and its management programmed entirely in Visual Basic for Applications and made public by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Decision Support Unit was downloaded and used to guide construction of its DICE version in Microsoft Excel(®). The DICE model was then run using the same inputs and settings, and the results were compared.
1:::To study the levels of pathogenic and non-pathogenic Th17 and Th22 cells in autoimmune thyroid disorders patients. Although Th17 cells seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of thyroid autoimmune disorders, the specific subsets of these lymphocytes have not been analyzed in this condition.
3:::We found increased levels of pathogenic Th17 lymphocytes and Th22 cells in peripheral blood from autoimmune thyroid disorders patients. In addition, these cells were detected in thyroid glands from HT patients. Furthermore, we found significant correlations between the levels of these cells and disease activity, disease duration, and the presence of ophthalmopathy.
4:::Our findings do not support an association between T. vaginalis infection and PCa.
2:::In a randomized, prospective, masked-observer study, 30 New Zealand albino rabbits underwent glaucoma filtration surgery. The animals were allocated to receive either intraoperative application of infliximab (group A) or mitomycin C (MMC) at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml (group B) or balanced salt solution (BSS, control) (group C). Different infliximab doses, namely 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 mg in 0.1 ml, were applied. Bleb survival and characteristics were evaluated over a 30-day period. The animals were killed on postoperative day 15 or 30. Histology of the operated eyes was performed to evaluate and grade the amount of scarring in each group. Cellular density was evaluated in each case.
3:::We selected 29, 20, 24, 22, and 16 patients from stages 1 to 5 CKD, respectively. In a sex-adjusted general linear model, mean ± SD of myeloperoxidase levels decreased from 18.1 ± 12.3 pmol in stage 1 to 10.9 ± 4.7 pmol in stage 5 (p = 0.011). In patients with and without CAD, the levels were 19.1 ± 10.1 and 14.8 ± 8.7 pmol (p = 0.036). There was an increase in 3-ClY mean from 0.81 ± 0.36 mmol/mol-tyrosine in stage 1 to 1.42 ± 0.41 mmol/mol-tyrosine in stage 5 (p < 0.001). The mean 3-ClY levels in patients with and without CAD were 1.25 ± 0.44 and 1.04 ± 0.42 mmol/mol-tyrosine (p = 0.023), respectively. C-statistic of ClY when added to myeloperoxidase level to predict CKD stage 5 was 0.86, compared to 0.79 for the myeloperoxidase level alone (p = 0.0097).
2:::Identified curriculum requirements included suitability for distance learning and applicability to many clinical intensive care units. Curriculum modules were cross-mapped to the ""Plan-Do-Study-Act"" model to aid in planning quality improvement projects. A questionnaire was e-mailed to users to evaluate the curriculums effectiveness.'
3:::Exposure to hypoxia reduced the expression of MCM7 mRNA and a primary transcript of miR-106b-25 cluster, but did not affect that of mature miRNAs. The putative promoter element of miR-106b-25 cluster was not bound by hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1-α), and was not activated under hypoxia.
3:::Twenty-seven patients, with a median age of 74 years (range=70-80 years) were treated for adenocarcinoma in 14 (52%) and SCC in 13 (48%), clinical stage IIIA in eight (30%) and IIIB in 19 (70%). Grade 3 or 4 toxicity was reported for five patients (18.5%). The ORR was 46% in 12 (partial responses) out of 26 assessable patients.
3:::Ratios of polyunsaturated to mono-unsaturated lysophosphatidylcholine, ceramide/sphingomyelin and cholesteryl ester/free cholesterol were changed in HCC compared to both control cohorts. The latter was most suited to diagnosing HCC. Systemic ratios of these lipid classes were not associated with fibrosis, staging or grade in patients with HCC.
3:::Rates of change were slower in women than men: DAS28 fell by 0.19 and 0.17 units/month, and HAQ-DI by 0.028 and 0.023 units/month in men and women, respectively. Baseline pain and EMS had small effects on rates of change, whereas fatigue VAS was only associated with DAS28 and HAQ-DI at baseline. In patients recruited up to 2002, DAS28 reduced more quickly in those with greater pain at baseline (by 0.01 units/mo of DAS28 per cm pain VAS, p = 0.024); in patients recruited after 2002, the effect for pain was stronger (by 0.01 units/mo, p = 0.087). DAS28 reduction was greater with longer EMS. In both cohorts, fall in HAQ-DI (p = 0.006) was greater in patients with longer EMS duration, but pain and fatigue were not significant predictors of change in HAQ-DI.
4:::The spatial-related flow parameters showed more consistency with the qualitative flow profile pattern for pulmonary arteries, and could be a decisive complement for diagnostic classification.
2:::After ethics committee approval, 102 consecutive patients who underwent breast conservative surgery for nonpalpable proven breast cancer were prospectively included. All patients underwent ultrasound/mammography-guided wire localization of their lesions. After excision, each specimen was marked for orientation and imaged using FFDM and DBT. Two blinded radiologists (R1, R2) independently analyzed images acquired with both modalities. Readers identified in which direction the lesion was closest to the specimen margin and to measure the margin width. Their findings were compared with the final histopathological analysis. True positive margin status was defined as a margin measuring <1mm for invasive cancer and 5mm for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) at imaging and pathology.
3:::Volume transfer constant (K(trans)) hot-spot value best correlated with TF (r=0.886, p<0.001), followed by 90th percentile K(trans) value (r=0.801, p<0.001). Moreover, histogram analysis of K(trans) value demonstrated that weak TF expression was associated with less heterogeneous and positively skewed distribution. Finally, pathology analysis revealed TF was associated with glioma grade and significantly correlated with these two dynamic angiogenic indexes which could be used to explain the strong correlation between K(trans) and TF expression.
1:::To analyze long-term outcomes in patients bridged/downstaged to orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or yttrium-90 radioembolization (Y90) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
3:::Antibiotic exposure in children within the first 2 years of life was associated with current asthma (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-2.70), current atopic dermatitis (aOR 1.40, 95% CI 1.01-1.94), and current allergic rhinitis (aOR 1.65, 95% CI 1. 05-2.58) at 5 years of age. Analysis of the associations by type of antibiotics showed that cephem was associated with current asthma (aOR 1.97, 95% CI 1.23-3.16) and current rhinitis (aOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.12-2.93), and macrolide was associated with current atopic dermatitis (aOR 1.58, 95% CI 1.07-2.33).
2:::Data were acquired from 13,782 subjects (8091 mothers) ages < 18 years who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, which was conducted from 2007 to 2014. The presence of allergic disease (asthma or atopic dermatitis) and depression was based on self-reported physician diagnosis in the health interview surveys.
3:::Of 540 households intended to be included in the survey, 507 responded to the study (94.24% response rate), covering the homes of 2759 people. More than 58% of the households had family size >5 (the regional average), and 60.2% of them had at least one child below the age of 5 years. The ownership of at least one LLIN among households surveyed was 89.9%, and using at least one LLIN during the night prior to the survey among net owners was 85.1% (n = 456). Only 36.7% (186) mentioned at least as the mean of correct scores of all participants for 14 possible malaria symptoms and 32.7% (166) knew at least as the mean of correct scores of all participants for possible preventive methods. Over 30% of nets owned by the households were out of use. After controlling for confounding factors, having two or more sleeping places (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.58, 95% CI 1.17, 5.73), knowledge that LLIN prevents malaria (aOR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.17, 5.37), the presence of hanging bed nets (aOR = 19.24, 95% CI 9.24, 40.07) and walls of the house plastered or painted >12 months ago (aOR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01, 0.71) were important predictors of LLIN utilization.
2:::Participants were residents (age 18-79, n = 61) of Utila, a Honduran island where economic disparities are overt and geographically contained. Objective SES was measured as a composite of income, education, and occupation. Subjective SES was measured with a MacArthur ladder and a perceived lifestyle discrepancy (PLD) scale. Salivary cortisol was collected three times per day for two days. Questions addressing demographic, social, and household characteristics were assessed as predictors of PLD.
4:::This study was the first to demonstrate SHOX duplications in three girls with tall stature and normal karyotypes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
3:::Pulp cell proliferation decreased with HEMA exposure in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. HEMA concentrations <400 μg/mL did not induce changes in cell viability at 48 h (P < 0.05). Pulp cells were induced to differentiate into odontoblast-like cells in media containing 5 mg/mL ascorbic acid and 10 mmol/L β-sodium glycerophosphate for 3-4 weeks. After incubation with HEMA, dose-dependent inhibition was observed; HEMA had a strong inhibitory effect on MMP activity. Compared with the control group, cell migration and MMP expression were inhibited significantly with increasing HEMA concentration at non-cytotoxic doses (P < 0.05).
2:::Retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with portopulmonary hypertension between 01/01/1988 - 06/30/2015 at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Compared age, sex, right ventricle systolic pressure by echocardiography, and right heart catheterization measurements/calculations among subgroups of portopulmonary hypertension patients with splenectomy and/or autoimmune liver disease (autoimmune hepatitis/primary biliary cirrhosis/primary sclerosing cholangitis).
3:::Hip hop interventions have been developed to improve health literacy, health behavior, and mental health. The interventions were primarily targeted to African-American and Latino children and adolescents. Many of the health literacy and mental health studies used non-experimental study designs. Among the 12 (of 14) health behavior studies that used experimental designs, the association between hip hop interventions and positive health outcomes was inconsistent.
4:::The study found a very high rate of binge drinking among ED visitors, and this suggests a need for large scale ED-based interventions. As binge drinkers are at elevated risk for accidents, violence and related problems, effective ED-based interventions could make an important contribution to public health. Accordingly, Israel is in the process of assessing the effectiveness of a large-scale ED-based counseling intervention.
2:::The current study was conducted during the formative phase of cluster-randomized trials of oral-fluid HIVST distribution. Young people aged 16-25 years were purposively selected for in-depth interviews (n = 15) in Malawi and 12 focus group discussions (n = 107) across countries. Representative samples of young people in both countries (n = 341) were administered discrete choice experiments on HIVST delivery, with data analyzed to estimate relative preferences. The qualitative results provided additional depth and were triangulated with the quantitative findings.
3:::There was strong concordance across methods and countries based on the three triangulation parameters: product, provider and service characteristics. HIVST was highly accepted by young people, if provided at no or very low cost. Young people expressed mixed views on oral-fluid tests, weighing perceived benefits with accuracy concerns. There was an expressed lack of trust in health providers and preference for lay community distributors. HIVST addressed youth-specific barriers to standard HIV testing, with home-based distribution considered convenient. Issues of autonomy, control, respect and confidentiality emerged as key qualitative themes.
3:::The median follow-up was 92 months (4 to 288). The mean MSTS 87 score was 29.1 (19 to 35), the mean MSTS 93 score was 82.2 (50 to 100) and the mean TESS score was 81.2 (43 to 100). Overall survival of the allograft was 84.8%. A total of 15 patients (33%) had a complication. Five allografts were revised for complications and one for local recurrence.
3:::A total of 6005 outpatient hemodialysis facilities reported dialysis event data for 2014 to the National Healthcare Safety Network. These facilities reported 160,971 dialysis events, including 29,516 bloodstream infections, 149,722 intravenous antimicrobial starts, and 38,310 pus, redness, or increased swelling at the hemodialysis vascular access site events; 22,576 (76.5%) bloodstream infections were considered vascular access related. Most bloodstream infections (63.0%) and access-related bloodstream infections (69.8%) occurred in patients with a central venous catheter. The rate of bloodstream infections per 100 patient-months was 0.64 (0.26 for arteriovenous fistula, 0.39 for arteriovenous graft, and 2.16 for central venous catheter). Other dialysis event rates were also highest among patients with a central venous catheter. Facility bloodstream infection standardized infection ratio distribution was positively skewed with a median of 0.84. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated bloodstream infection pathogen (30.6%), and 39.5% of S. aureus isolates tested were resistant to methicillin.
4:::The 2014 National Healthcare Safety Network Dialysis Event data represent nearly all United States outpatient dialysis facilities. Rates of infection and other dialysis events were highest among patients with a central venous catheter compared with other vascular access types. Surveillance data can help define the epidemiology of important infections in this patient population.
2:::A critical review was conducted by identifying relevant studies in the electronic databases PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and CINAHL from 2011 to the present. Because of the limited number of publications focused exclusively on mild traumatic brain injury, research studies that assessed the impact of computer-based interventions on cognitive outcomes in populations with acquired brain injury were included.
3:::Of the 58 studies identified, only 10 publications included participants with mild traumatic brain injury. Overall, the identified studies did not use a standard method for assessing the severity of traumatic brain injury, and many studies included participants with a wide variety of etiologies for acquired brain injury and used multiple measures of cognitive performance, which made comparisons difficult across studies. In addition to small sample sizes, the study samples were heterogeneous in regard to the number of previous traumatic brain injuries, time elapsed since injury, and age and gender distributions. Preinjury comorbidities that may affect cognitive performance, such as depression, anxiety, or learning disabilities, were often not assessed.
3:::Data analysis revealed that perceived competency in palliative and EOL care is significantly higher in the ICU nurses (p <.0001). Mean scores were significantly higher when nurses had more than 10 years of experience (p <.0001). Open-ended responses indicated concerns regarding improved communication behaviors, decision making, and facilitation of continuity of care.
2:::Subjects (ages 17-42, n = 21) wore short wavelength-blocking glasses prior to bedtime for 2 weeks. The ipRGC-mediated post illumination pupil response was measured before and after the experimental period. Stimulation was presented with a ganzfeld stimulator, including one-second and five-seconds of long and short wavelength light, and the pupil was imaged with an infrared camera. Pupil diameter was measured before, during and for 60 s following stimulation, and the six-second and 30 s post illumination pupil response and area under the curve following light offset were determined. Subjects wore an actigraph device for objective measurements of activity, light exposure, and sleep. Saliva samples were collected to assess melatonin content. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was administered to assess subjective sleep quality.
4:::Fourier decomposition of posterior Keratometric data provides parameters with high accuracy in differentiating SKC from normal corneas and should be included in the prompt diagnosis of KC.
3:::The total V-V angle in the ACL-deficient knee under 5 Nm of V-V torque was significantly greater than that in the intact knee, whereas the angle in the ACL-deficient knee with 30 N of posterior tibial load was significantly smaller than that in the ACL-deficient knee and approached that in the intact knee, at both 30° and 60° of flexion. The in situ force of the ACL was approximately 30 N at 30° and 16 N at 60° of flexion under 5 Nm of both varus and valgus torques.
2:::The oxygen-sensing paint-on bandage was applied to the left hind limb in a rodent model. Simultaneously, a near-infrared imaging device and Clark electrode were attached to the right and left hind limbs, respectively. Tissue oxygenation was measured under normal, ischemic (aortic ligation), and reperfused conditions.
3:::The child demonstrated gains in throwing accuracy, significant gains on measures of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-2, the Test of Gross Motor Development-2, and the School Function Assessment.
4:::Fertility rates in HIV-positive women are stable in the context of generally decreasing fertility. Despite a decrease in HIV-exposed infants, there has been an increase in ART-exposed infants.
2:::MMD, defined as the inability to walk 400 m, was determined over an average follow-up of 2.6 years. Participants were divided into four subgroups: (1) nonobese (BMI < 30 kg/m(2) ; n = 437); (2) nonobese with high waist circumference (WC > 102 cm [men], > 88 cm [women]; n = 434); (3) class 1 obesity (30 kg/m(2)  ≤ BMI < 35 kg/m(2) ; n = 430); and (4) class 2 + obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2) ; n = 312). Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to test an obesity by intervention interaction.
3:::Moderate-to-severe PTH was reported by 21.9% of patients (29.8% in mTIH group and 14.0% in non-mTIH group B, p = 0.012) at the 12-month follow-up. The mean NRS was higher in mTIH group than in non-mTIH group throughout the follow-up period (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11 to 1.14; p < 0.05, ANCOVA). Logistic regression analysis showed that post-traumatic seizure (odds ratio, 1.520; 95% CI, 1.128-6.785; p = 0.047) and mTIH (odds ratio, 2.194; 95% CI, 1.285-8.475; p = 0.039) were independently associated with moderate-to-severe PTH at the 12-month follow-up.
3:::The review of 49 sections (mean=16.3, range=14-20) in the three colectomies revealed 60 ulcers (mean=20, range=13-27). The following CCC phenotypes were found bordering mucosal ulcers: with asymmetric lateral fission (n=11), with dual or three-foiled corrupted fission (n=19), with cystic dilatations (n=3), L-shaped crypts (n=7), T-inverted crypts (n=6), shoe-shaped crypts (n=3), horizontal crypts (n=14), multi-lobate crypts (n=2), and/or inter-connecting crypts (n=5).
3:::The region corresponding to the maxillary canines appeared to be thinner, and the palatal area of the maxillary central incisors and the distobuccal region of the mandibular second molars appeared to be thicker. Greater tooth inclinations were observed in the maxillary incisors and mandibular canines, and smaller tooth inclinations were observed on the buccal roots of the mandibular second molars.
4:::The prevalence of malocclusion was higher among children with ASD. Posterior crossbite, increased overjet, and severe maxillary crowding were the most common malocclusion traits in these children.
2:::Electronic databases and reference lists of relevant studies were searched with no language restriction (PROSPERO: CRD42016036059). Randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, case series, qualitative and mixed-methods studies objectively assessing compliance levels were identified. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaborations risk of bias tool, risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions (ROBINS-I), or mixed-methods appraisal tool based on their design.'
1:::This work aims to characterize the relationship between tear film neuropeptide substance P and the structural integrity of the sub-basal nerve plexus in diabetes.
3:::Of 1,598 eligible patients, 719 (45.0%) were persistent D-ER users, and 879 (55.0%) were nonpersistent D-ER users. The 2 cohorts had similar demographic and clinical characteristics, with mean (SD) ages of 51.0 (8.4) and 50.6 (8.6) years and were 71.3% and 66.6% female, respectively. Compared with nonpersistent D-ER use, persistent D-ER use was associated with lower odds of all-cause inpatient admissions (OR = 0.58, P = 0.010) and MS-related inpatient admissions (OR = 0.50, P = 0.004). Persistent use was also associated with lower inpatient expenditures for all-cause admissions ($669 vs. $1,515, P = 0.002) and MS-related admissions ($388 vs. $891, P = 0.008).
4:::Radiation therapy for breast and regional lymph nodes in crawl position is feasible. Good comfort and set-up precision were demonstrated. Planning results support the hypothesis that breast and regional lymph nodes can be treated in crawl position with less dose to organs at risk and equal or better dose distribution in the target volumes than in supine position. The crawl technique is a candidate methodology for further investigation for patients requiring breast and regional lymph node irradiation.
2:::Creation of the registry, which began in August 2014, entailed use of an existing platform, which could interface with the outpatient EHR. The registry was designed to help ensure regular testing and monitoring of patients while enabling identification of patients and subpopulations with suboptimal management. The work flow used for the clinics warfarin patients was also redesigned. An assessment indicated that the registry identified 341 (96%) of 357 patients actively seen in the clinic.'
3:::As of this writing, I-PASS Study Group members have directly worked with more than 50 hospitals to facilitate implementation of I-PASS. To further disseminate I-PASS, Study Group members delivered hundreds of academic presentations, including plenaries at scientific meetings, workshops, and institutional Grand Rounds. Some 3,563 individuals, representing more than 500 institutions in the 50 states in the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 57 other countries, have requested access to I-PASS materials. Most recently, the I-PASS(SM) Patient Safety Institute has developed a virtual immersion training platform, mobile handoff observational tools, and processes to facilitate further spread of I-PASS.
3:::Compared with individuals without ADHD, those with ADHD were significantly more likely to become parents at 12 to 16 years of age (IRR for females 3.62, 95% CI 2.14-6.13; IRR for males 2.30, 95% CI 1.27-4.17) and at 17 to 19 years of age (IRR for females 1.94, 95% CI 1.62-2.33; IRR for males 2.27, 95% CI 1.90-2.70).
2:::A standard deltopectoral approach was performed on 10 fresh-frozen cadaveric specimens. The distance between AN and the inferior border of the humeral head and inferior glenoid while placing the shoulder in 0°, 45°, and 90° of external rotation or abduction was measured. Continuous variables for changes in AN position were compared with paired 2-tailed Student t test.
4:::Utilization of both TWA and WF has remained unchanged among emerging career orthopedic surgeons. Although WF is performed nearly 5 times more frequently than TWA, our short-term findings suggest that TWA compares favorably with WF.
3:::A total of 1807 patients were identified for this study; 59% were male, and the mean age at time of injury was 8 years. Most commonly, injuries occurred when a finger was crushed (n = 831, 46%) in a door or window. Average length of stay in the ED was 3 hours 45 minutes, 25% of cases needed surgery, and, on average, patients had more than 1 follow-up appointment. About one-third of patients were referred from outside institutions. The average ED charge for fingertip injuries was $1195 in 2014, which would amount to about $320 430 each year (in 2014 dollars) for fingertip injuries presenting to BCH.
2:::A total of 61 prospectively collected cases, including 40 children with EoE and 21 children with GERD, and a control group of 14 sex- and age-matched healthy children were enrolled. Patients with EoE were treated with skin testing-driven elimination diet and/or corticosteroids. The immunohistochemical expression of FLG and POSTN was evaluated in esophageal biopsies obtained from patients and controls, and the results were correlated with EoE-related clinicopathological parameters.
4:::Cyclosporine had the highest response rate at 6 months in children with standard-treatment-refractory AIH; however, it also had the highest rate of adverse events. MMF was the second most efficacious option with a low adverse effect rate.
3:::All patients in this series reported postural lightheadedness and syncope or near-syncope. Autonomic testing confirmed the presence of orthostatic hypotension on tilt-table testing in 5 patients and an excessive postural tachycardia and/or hypertensive response in 8 patients. Only 2 of the patients with orthostatic hypotension had a significant sensory neuropathy. Symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal and genitourinary impairment were seen in nearly all patients, with abnormal motility testing (most frequently esophageal dysmotility) in 5 of 6 patients who underwent formal testing. Patients in this series treated with immune-modulating therapy experienced significant improvement.
3:::A total of 382 patients (mean age: 54 years) participated in the Netherlands; 81% were below retirement age and of these, 31% were employed. Employment was inversely related to disease severity, and MS affected productivity at work for 82% of patients. Overall, 96% and 73% of patients experienced fatigue and cognitive difficulties, respectively, as a problem. Mean utility and annual costs were 0.744 and €23,100 at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-3, 0.595 and €32,300 at EDSS 4-6.5, and 0.297 and €50,500 at EDSS 7-9. The mean cost of a relapse was estimated at €3000.
2:::Protein conformational changes and aggregation after loading and release was evaluated by circular dichroism (CD), steady-state tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, electrophoresis and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Finally, the capacity of both released proteins to bind to VEGF was tested by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology.
3:::Seventy-eight strains were identified as resistant to at least one carbapenem; these CRKP strains had a high prevalence rate (38.5%, 30/78) of carbapenemase producers. Additionally, most isolates harbored MDR genes, including Extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC, and quinolone and aminoglycoside resistance genes. Loss of porin genes was observed, and Class 1 integron was detected in 66.7% of the investigated isolates. PFGE and MLST results excluded the occurrence of clonal dissemination among these isolates.
4:::A high prevalence of NDM-1 genes encoding carbapenem resistance determinants was demonstrated among the K. pneumoniae isolates. Importantly, this is the first report of bla(NDM-1) carriage in a K. pneumoniae ST1383 clone in China and of a MDR CRKP isolate co-harboring bla(NDM-1), bla(KPC-2), bla(CTX-M), bla(SHV), acc(6)-Ib, rmtB, qnrB, and acc(6')-Ib-cr.'
2:::A total of 90 subjects including 40 healthy individuals and 50 MS patients [24 with classical clinical course of MS (C-MS), 26 with benign MS (B-MS)] were recruited for this study. The levels of serum adipokines and inflammatory mediators were measured using immunoassay methods.
3:::The levels of adiponectin, MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly higher in C-MS patients compared with B-MS patients and healthy controls. Only adiponectin and MCP-1 levels remained significantly high after Bonferroni correction. Adiponectin, MCP-1 and TNF-α levels showed a modest correlation with expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores, which disappeared after Bonferroni correction.
4:::Aromatherapy is a viable intervention for improving insomnia and other symptoms commonly experienced by patients with acute leukemia.
3:::Patients consisted of a total of 134 program completers (72 males, 62 females; mean age = 67.8 years). Significant improvements in functional performance with regard to 6MWT scores were observed across all groups postintervention (P < .05). The Present group, in both the anxiety and depression domains, failed to reach a minimally clinically important difference postintervention. The Probable and Present groups achieved a significant improvement in CAT scores postintervention (P < .05).
2:::EmploYEd antithrombotic therapies in patients with acute coronary Syndromes HOspitalized in iTalian cardiac care units was a nationwide, prospective registry aimed to evaluate antithrombotic strategies employed in ACS patients in Italy.
3:::Of the 94 patients, four underwent conservative treatment and 90 underwent operations. Seventy-five patients (79.8%) were followed up for a minimum of 24 months or until death. The median follow-up duration was 75.3 months. The overall recurrence rate was 37.3%. Ten patients (13.3%) died before the last follow-up (median: 18.5 months). Two patients (2.6%) developed osteogenic sarcoma. The local recurrence rate was 80.0% (24/30) in patients who underwent intralesional curettage, 8.8% (3/34) in patients who underwent extracapsular piecemeal spondylectomy, and 0 (0/9) in patients who underwent TES. The risk factors for local recurrence were lesions located in the cervical spine (P = 0.049), intralesional curettage (P < 0.001), repeated surgeries (P = 0.014), and malignancy (P < 0.001). Malignant transformation was a significant risk factor for death (P < 0.001).
2:::The NEMA body phantom with determined Tc-99m concentration was scanned with the four state-of-the-art SPECT/CT systems. SPECT data were reconstructed using different numbers of the product of subset and iteration numbers (SI) and the width of 3D Gaussian filter (3DGF). The mean (SUVmean), maximal (SUVmax), and peak (SUVpeak) SUVs for six hot spheres (10, 13, 17, 22, 28, and 37 mm) were measured after converting SPECT count into SUV using Becquerel calibration factor. DRO smoothed by 3DGF with a FWHM of 17 mm (DRO17 mm) was generated, and the corresponding SUVs were measured. The reconstruction condition to yield the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of SUVmeans for all the spheres between DRO17 mm and actual phantom images was determined as the harmonized condition for each SPECT/CT scanner. Then, inter-scanner variability in all quantitative metrics was measured before (i.e., according to the manufacturers recommendation or the policies of their own departments) and after harmonization.'
4:::Our proposed method clearly reduced inter-scanner variability in SUVs. A digital phantom developed by QIBA would be useful for harmonizing SUVs in multicenter trials using SPECT/CT.
3:::The study included 9362 patients from 51 centers in Australia. The technique failure rate was 0.35 (95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.36) episodes per patient-year, with a sevenfold variation across centers that was mainly associated with center-level characteristics. Technique failure was significantly less likely in centers with larger proportions of patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (>29%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 0.94) and more likely in smaller centers (<16 new patients per year; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.21) and centers with lower proportions of patients achieving target baseline serum phosphate levels (<40%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.29). Similar results were observed for death-censored technique failure, except that center target phosphate achievement was not significantly associated. Technique failure due to infection, social reasons, mechanical causes, or death was variably associated with center size, proportion of patients on peritoneal dialysis, and/or target phosphate achievement, automated peritoneal dialysis exposure, icodextrin use, and antifungal use. The variation of hazards of technique failure across centers was reduced by 28% after adjusting for patient-specific factors and an additional 53% after adding center-specific factors.
3:::Nanoparticles functionalized by both probes efficiently interacted with the three types of amyloid fibrils, with KD values in 10 micromolar and 10 nanomolar range for, respectively, Pittsburgh compound B and B10AP nanoparticles. Moreover, they allowed the detection of amyloid deposits on pathological tissues.
4:::Hospital costs represent the largest portion of acute and long-term costs in this population. Detailed costing using utilization data is feasible and representative of UK clinical practice, but is labor intensive. The availability of a standardized coding system in the UK drug costing data would greatly facilitate drug costing.
2:::In 15 patients with severe horizontal alveolar ridge resorption, lateral augmentation procedures were performed using CCXBB as bone replacement grafts. Twenty-six weeks postoperatively, a re-entry procedure was performed to evaluate the bone width for adequate implant placement and two histological specimens were retrieved from each patient, one being processed for ground sectioning and the other for decalcified paraffin-included sections. In non-decalcified sections, the relative proportions occupied by bone, biomaterials, and connective tissue present in the biopsies were identified. In de-calcified sections, structures and cells positive for osteopontin (OPN), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity (TRAP), osteocalcin (OSC), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were assessed.
3:::SAGES has developed an educational curriculum across eight domains (Acute Care, Biliary, Bariatric, Colorectal, Hernia, Foregut, Flex Endoscopy, and Robotic Surrey) incorporating SAGES educational materials and guidelines, social media, coaching and mentoring.
3:::Staphylococcus aureus infection was more common in hemodialysis patients than in nonhemodialysis patients (42% vs 21%; P < .0001), but invasive disease was similar in the 2 groups (47%; P = .3). Hospital mortality was 13% and 5-year survival was 20% for hemodialysis patients, 20% below that expected in a general hemodialysis population but 15% above that of hemodialysis patients treated nonsurgically for IE. For matched patients, hospital mortality was 13% for hemodialysis patients versus 5.1% for nonhemodialysis patients (P = .05), and survival at 1 and 5 years was 56% versus 83% and 24% versus 59%, respectively (P < .004). Use of an arteriovenous graft for dialysis access (P = .01) and preoperative placement of a pacemaker (P < .0001) were risk factors for late mortality in hemodialysis patients. For matched patients, freedom from reoperation was similar in the hemodialysis and nonhemodialysis groups (P > .9).
4:::The use of a hexapod frame for the infected tibial nonunions with bone loss is an effective method for achieving union and eradicating infection in a difficult orthopaedic patient population. Use of adjunctive stabilization is a reasonable technique to address delayed regenerate and docking site nonunions.
3:::There were no differences in baseline physiology or during the initial 30 minutes of hypotension. During the 60-minute intervention period, REBOA resulted in higher maximal pMAP (REBOA, 105.3 ± 8.8; PAO, 92.7 ± 9.2; Control, 48.9 ± 7.7; p = 0.02) and higher Qcarotid (REBOA, 673.1 ± 57.9; PAO, 464.2 ± 53.0; Control, 170.3 ± 29.4; p < 0.01). Increases in ICP were greatest during blood resuscitation, with Control animals demonstrating the largest peak ICP (Control, 12.8 ± 1.2; REBOA, 5.1 ± 0.6; PAO, 9.4 ± 1.1; p < 0.01). There were no differences in the percentage of animals with hemorrhage progression on CT (Control, 14.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-57.9; REBOA, 28.6%; 95% CI, 3.7-71.0; and PAO, 28.6%; 95% CI, 3.7-71.0).
2:::Preoperative smoking status, self-reported depression, prevalence of diabetes, obesity, level of education, and employment status were assessed in the context of patient outcome and satisfaction after lumbar spine surgery. Patients were contacted before surgery, and at 3 and 12 months postoperatively, and responded to Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) self-assessment examinations, as well as a satisfaction measure.
4:::VESC prevalence increases with age, underlying the degenerative causative etiology. Surgical indication should not be stated on the basis of the VESC findings alone, the main factor for indicating surgery depends more on other associated degenerative spinal changes.
3:::The mean vertebral canal area and sagittal diameter of the lateral recess were significantly larger at 6 months and 2 years after surgery compared with 1 day before surgery (P<0.001). The mean JOA scale scores were significantly higher at 6 and 24 months following surgery compared with before surgery (P<0.001). The mean Oswestry Disability Index scores and Visual Analogue Scale scores at 6 months and 2 years after surgery were significantly lower compared with before surgery (both P<0.001). The mean JOA recovery rates at 6 months and 2 years of follow-up were 61% and 64.3%, respectively.
2:::Sixteen consecutive patients received 36 months post-surgical follow-up in a single-center. Six had phantom limb pain after amputation and ten deafferentation pain after brachial plexus injury, all due to traumas. To evaluate the efficacy of DBS, patient-reported outcome measures were collated before and after surgery, using a visual analog scale (VAS) score, University of Washington Neuropathic Pain Score (UWNPS), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).
4:::Researchers and practitioners can use the isometric squat and isometric mid-thigh pull with confidence in terms of reliability and construct validity. Further work to investigate other validity components such as criterion validity, smallest detectable change and responsiveness to resistance exercise interventions may be beneficial to the current level of evidence.
3:::Of the 858 women included, 730 (85.1%) were white and 128 (14.9%) were nonwhite. Univariate analysis demonstrated that nonwhite women had higher rates of preterm birth <32 weeks (12.5 versus 6.7%, p = .022), cesarean delivery (78.1% versus 61.4% of all women, p < .001 and 43.5% versus 16.1% of women who attempted labor, p < .001), preeclampsia (22.4% versus 14.5%, p = .029) and gestational diabetes (23.2% versus 7.3%, p < .001). On adjusted analysis, nonwhite race remained significantly associated with cesarean delivery in women who attempted labor (aOR 2.27, 95% CI: 1.09, 4.71) and gestational diabetes (aOR 2.61, 95% CI: 1.53, 4.45).
2:::Relative expression levels of NNT-AS1 in cervical cancer tissues were determined by qRT-PCR. The biologic functions of NNT-AS1 in cervical cancer were explored by MTT assay, transwell assay and flow cytometric analysis in vitro. The influence of NNT-AS1 on tumorigenesis was measured by mice xenograft model. In addition, we evaluated the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by luciferase assay and western blot.
3:::Four hundred three records were screened. Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Four scales were identified: the Scale for Contraversive Pushing (SCP), the Modified Scale for Contraversive Pushing (M-SCP), the Burke Lateropulsion Scale (BLS), and the Swedish Scale for Contraversive Pushing (S-SCP). Psychometric property investigation was most robust for the SCP and the BLS. Cross-cultural validity has not been fully investigated in scales used outside of their country of origin.
4:::Thread carpal tunnel release is potentially a safe, quick, and effective procedure to transect the transverse carpal ligament. Future clinical investigation is recommended.
2:::We used proportional hazards methods to determine adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) for associations between several components of acute exposures (e.g., injury, immersion in the dust cloud) and four chronic disease outcomes: asthma, other non-neoplastic lung diseases, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, in 8701 persons free of those conditions prior to exposure and who were physically present during or immediately after the World Trade Center attacks. Participants were followed prospectively up to 11 years post-9/11.
3:::A total of 40 patients (5.5%) had recurrent IS or TIA within 1 year of posterior circulation IS. Multivariate Cox regression identified chief complaint with dysphagia (hazard ratio [HR], 4.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69-10.2; P=0.002), repeated TIAs within 3 months before the stroke (HR, 15.4; 95% CI, 5.55-42.5; P<0.0001), responsible artery stenosis ≥70% (HR, 7.91; 95% CI, 1.00-62.6; P=0.05), multisector infarcts (HR, 5.38; 95% CI, 1.25-23.3; P=0.02), and not on antithrombotics treatment at discharge (HR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.09-8.58; P=0.03) as independent predictors of recurrent IS or TIA.
4:::The disparity in ambulatory medical follow-up following surgery among black or African American vs nonblack or non-African American Veterans in the Midwest region deserves further study and may lead to important quality improvement initiatives aimed specifically at this population.
3:::mtDNA and hepcidin levels were significantly increased in OB/GDM(-) versus NW, significantly correlating with pregestational BMI. Male/female (M/F) ratio was equal in study groups, and overall F-carrying pregnancies showed significantly higher mtDNA and hepcidin levels than M-carrying pregnancies both in obese and normal weight mothers.
4:::Our results indicate a potential compensatory mechanism to increased obesity-related OxS and inflammation, indicated by the higher hepcidin levels found in obese mothers. Increased placental mitochondrial biogenesis, due to lipotoxic environment, may account for the greater mtDNA amount released in maternal circulation. This increase is namely related to F-carrying pregnancies, suggesting a gender-specific placental response.
2:::We estimated 3-year progression to clinically determined Stage D HF and competing mortality among 964 outpatients with Stage C heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), where ejection fraction is ≤40%.
3:::Significant correlations were observed between SUVmean, max, peak, TLG with K(trans) (ρ=0.446, 0.417, 0.491, 0.430; p≤0.01); with Kep(ρ=0.303, ρ=0.315, ρ=0.319; p≤0.05); and with iAUC(ρ=0.401, ρ=0.410, ρ=0.379; p≤0.05, p≤0.01). The ratio of ve/iAUC showed significant negative correlation to SUVmean, max, peak and TLG (ρ=0.420, 0.446, 0.443, 0.426; p≤0.01). Ability of SUV as well as pharmacokinetic parameters to predict response to therapy matched the RECIST criteria in 9 out of 11 lesions in 9 patients. Maximum post therapy quantitative reduction was observed in SUVpeak, TLG and K(trans).
1:::To determine the utility of liver T1-mapping on gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for the measurement of liver functional reserve compared with the signal intensity (SI) based parameters, technetium-99m-galactosyl serum albumin ((99m)Tc-GSA) scintigraphy and indocyanine green (ICG) clearance.
4:::This large study is expected to provide a comprehensive picture of patients with SVT under clinical practice conditions in Germany.
2:::Placentae were obtained following normal pregnancy and from pregnancies affected by preeclampsia. Washed villous tissue fragments were used to prepare syncytial microvillous (MVM) and basal plasma membranes (BM) microvesicles. GLUT1 protein and mRNA expression was assessed by western blot analysis and qPCR using Fast SYBR Green. A radio-labeled glucose up-take assay using placenta-derived syncytial microvesicles was used to analyze GLUT1 function.
3:::GLUT1 protein expression was significantly down-regulated in (apical) MVM of the syncytiotrophoblast in preeclampsia (n = 6) compared to controls (n = 6) (0.40 ± 0.04 versus 1.00 ± 0.06, arbitrary units, P < 0.001, Students t-test), while GLUT1 mRNA expression did not show a significant difference. In addition, the functional assay in syncytial microvesicles showed a significantly decreased glucose transport activity in preeclampsia (61.78 ± 6.48%, P < 0.05) compared to controls. BM GLUT1 protein expression was unchanged and glucose up-take into BM microvesicles showed no differences between the preeclampsia and control groups.'
2:::This was an observational study of attendance from past SRS AM and IMAST meetings. Fourteen years of AM and 8 years of IMAST data were made available from the SRS. Participation based on delegate type and countries were tallied. Details from the 10 most represented nations and host nations per year were also tallied, and their national holidays were reviewed for overlaps with the AM.
3:::Membership in AM and IMAST increased from 820 in 2003 to 1,323 in 2016. Attendance at the AM has increased, whereas attendance at IMAST has declined, even after adjusting for membership size. Trends in participation were highly influenced by location. Participation by attendees from the host continent, and especially the host country, is generally high. The negative impact of distant meetings is profoundly seen with North Americans, whereas the positive impact of a nearby meeting was mostly clearly demonstrated by South Americans. Although SRS AM overlapped with holidays in China, Japan, or Korea nearly 50% of the time, this did not influence participation by delegates from these countries.
3:::A significant reduction in Th1 lymphocyte frequency, transcription factor expression and cytokine levels were observed in IVIG-treated group, while all the above parameters indicated a significant increase for Th2 lymphocytes. Th1/Th2 ratio decreased significantly (p value<0.0001) at the end of treatment and 28 out of 32 (87.5%) women in IVIG-treated group had live birth in comparison with 5 out of 12 (41.6%) in untreated group.
4:::We described the largest cohort of severe systemic capillary-leak syndrome flares requiring ICU admission. High-volume fluid therapy was independently associated with poorer outcomes. IV immunoglobulin use was not associated with improved survival; hence, their use should be considered prudently and needs further evaluation in future studies.
2:::Blood samples were collected from 51 patients with plaque psoriasis. EGF and sEGFR plasma concentrations were examined with immunoenzymatic method prior and 14 days after topical treatment. The outcomes were analyzed with respect to PASI.
3:::We found one significant DMP (cg03559389, DIP2C) and 104 significant DMRs after multiple-testing correction. Of these, 34 DMRs mapped to genes differential expressed with respect to the same trait. Five of the genes were associated with more than two traits: CTU2, USP36, ZNF516, KLK10 and CPT1B.
2:::Respiratory Health in Northern Europe (RHINE) provided information about snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), BMI and somatic diseases at baseline (1999-2001) and follow-up (2010-2012) from 4962 men and 5892 women. At follow-up participants were asked whether they had a diagnosis of and/or treatment for sleep apnea.
3:::Among those with symptoms of SDB (snoring and EDS), more men than women had been given the diagnosis of sleep apnea (25% vs. 14%, p < 0.001), any treatment (17% vs. 11%, p = 0.05) and CPAP (6% vs. 3%, p = 0.04) at follow-up. Predictors of receiving treatment were age, BMI, SDB symptoms at baseline and weight gain, while female gender was related to a lower probability of receiving treatment (adj. OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.3-0.5). In both genders, the symptoms of SDB increased the risk of developing hypertension (adj OR, 95% CI: 1.5, 1.2-1.8) and diabetes (1.5, 1.05-2.3), independent of age, BMI, smoking and weight gain.
4:::Limitations in the available literature prevent firm conclusions from being reached about the relative economic merits of the various approaches to the prevention of PIs. The authors review revealed a need for additional high-quality studies that adhere to commonly used standards of both currently utilized and emerging ways to prevent hospital-acquired PIs.'
3:::In sepsis combined with hyperglycemia the least CSE and PGC1α expression could be detected, along with reduced mitochondrial respiratory activity, and enhanced ADRP expression, a marker of lipid droplet formation, in the liver. A novel in vivo finding is the CSE translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus triggered by metabolic stress.
2:::Observational case report.
3:::The net differences in ECD estimates when comparing sets of 20 cells with 200 cells were 5.0% ± 3.9%, 8.1% ± 7.3%, 11.3% ± 9.4%, and 14.5% ± 12.4% for groups 1 to 4, respectively. For measures on 100 cells per image, the predicted variances in ECD values were 5.6%, 8.8%, 11.1%, and 13.7% for the 4 groups.
4:::Results supported the conclusion that pain catastrophizing and sex moderate the relationship between pain intensity and opioid prescription. Although men and women patients had similar Pain Catastrophizing Scale scores, historically ""subthreshold"" levels of pain catastrophizing were significantly associated with opioid prescription only for women patients. These findings suggest that pain intensity and catastrophizing contribute to different patterns of opioid prescription for men and women patients, highlighting a potential need for examination and intervention in future studies.
3:::For all B cell lymphomas, an increased risk (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.0) was observed in the highest exposure category (consumption >4 cups per day for at least 30 years), but without a clear dose-response trend. Subgroup analyses highlighted an increased risk for drinkers of at least four cups per day for follicular lymphoma (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.4). The risk increased with years of exposure and was more elevated among current smokers.
2:::We analyzed the annual transition of prevalence, geographic origin of dengue infection, and seasonal distribution of occurrence. The raw data on dengue cases in Korea were obtained from the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention infectious diseases surveillance website and Korean Statistical Information Service website. Data on dengue cases in Japan were obtained from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japans Infectious Disease Surveillance Center website.'
3:::RXRα Was found to directly bind to HBV cccDNA; recruitment of RXRα to HBV mini-chromosome paralleled HBV replication, histone recruitment, and histone acetylation in HBVcccDNA. Moreover, RXRα overexpression or knock-down significantly increased or impaired the recruitment of the p300 acetyltransferase to cccDNAminichromosome.
4:::Brain-infiltrating IL-17-producing γδ T cells belong to the subset of natural IL-17-producing γδ T cells. In stroke, these previously unrecognized innate lymphocytes trigger a highly conserved immune reaction, which is known from host responses toward pathogens. We demonstrate that therapeutic approaches targeting synergistic IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor-α pathways in parallel offer additional neuroprotection in stroke.
2:::In this randomized controlled study, a total of 150 type 2 diabetes patients who had a mean age of 49.8±7.3years, 51% male, with disease duration <1year and without evidence of atherosclerosis were randomized into an intensive intervention group (IG), in which patients received multiple risk factors intervention by the special project team and tried to reach the pre-determined intervention goals, and a conventional group (CG), in which patients received standard diabetes care by the clinic doctor. All patients recieved intervention study for 7 years, then underwent a 3-year observational follow-up study. The primary endpoints were occurrence of subclinical atherosclerosis, defined as the intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery (CC-IMT)≥1.0mm or formation of atherosclerosis plaques, and the occurrence of cardiovascular events.
3:::Based on histologic features and IHC results, we were able to reclassify 10 tumors (8 Adca-NOS and 2 PLGA) as CATMSG.
3:::Sixty-eight patients (inoperable CTEPH, n = 41; PAH, n = 27) entered the long-term extension. Median treatment duration at the final data cut-off was 77 months. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis (57%) and peripheral edema (37%). Three patients (4%) experienced serious adverse events of hemoptysis: two moderate, one severe, none fatal or considered drug-related. At Month 48, 6-minute walking distance increased from baseline by 69 ± 105 m, and World Health Organization functional class improved/stabilized/worsened versus baseline in 50/45/5% of patients. Three-year survival and clinical worsening-free survival were 91% and 49%, respectively (with patients censored if they withdrew without experiencing an event). Starting a new PAH treatment was the most frequent clinical worsening event.
4:::Despite heterogeneity in MMT duration, abuse duration, substance use and psychiatric comorbidity, all performed within ±1 SD of average for age and education in most cognitive domains. Our findings challenge the notion of MMT as being synonymous with compromised cognition and may lead to reduced bias regarding cognitive function of MMT patients.
2:::Sustained stimuli included 2-rev/s, 85% contrast checkerboard patterns of 1- and 2-degree check sizes, whereas transient stimuli comprised 4-rev/s, 10% contrast vertical sinusoidal gratings with column width of 0.25 and 0.50 cycles/degree. We tested two models: an a priori clinical model based on an assumption of at least a minimal (beyond instrumentations margin of error) 2-millisecond lag of transient response latencies behind sustained response latencies in concussed patients and a statistical model derived from the sample data.'
3:::The prevalence of PCLs was 13.7%, which was increased according to age. Individuals with PCLs were more prone to obesity (body mass index, 24.0 vs 23.7 kg/m [P = 0.015]; waist circumference, 87.4 vs 85.5 cm [P < 0.001]). DM was more prevalent in individuals with PCLs (18.4% vs 10.5%, P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; P < 0.001), excess body mass index (OR, 1.26; P = 0.039), and DM (OR, 1.39; P = 0.005) were associated with PCLs.
4:::Relapse is a frequent problem in PD, and long-term treatment does not protect these patients in the long run. Treatment with clonazepam predicts lower relapse when compared with paroxetine.
1:::To investigate the effects of high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy on cellular progression of a radioresistant human squamous cell carcinoma in vitro, based on clinical parameters.
2:::Three hundred fifty women aged 22 to 33 years from the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial provided exfoliated cells from the cervical and oral regions at 2 visits 2 years apart. Samples from both visits were tested for 25 characterized α HPV types by the SPF10 PCR-DNA enzyme immunoassay-LiPA25 version 1 system. Risk factors for oral HPV persistence were calculated utilizing generalized estimating equations with a logistic link.
3:::The proportion of male gonorrhea cases among MSM varied by jurisdiction (range: 20% to 98%). Estimated MSM rate increased from 1369 cases per 100,000 in 2010 to 3435 cases per 100,000 in 2015. Between 2010 and 2015, the MSM-to-Women gonorrhea rate ratio increased from 13:1 to 24:1, and the MSM-to-MSW gonorrhea rate ratio increased from 16:1 to 31:1.
4:::RBC transfusion is commonly used in the early resuscitation of septic patients with hematological malignancies. Although it was preferentially provided to the most severe patients, we found it possibly associated with an increased risk of death.
2:::A 6-year prospective study (May 2009-March 2015) in the medical ICU of an 850-bed university-affiliated hospital was conducted.
3:::Of the 6303 patients admitted, 843 (13.4%) had ESBL-PE carriage detected. Among carriers, 111 (13%) patients developed ICU-acquired pneumonia of whom 48 (43%) had ESBL-PE pneumonia (6% of carriers). By multivariable analysis, SAPS II at admission >43 [OR 2.81 (1.16-6.79)] and colonization with Enterobacter sp. or K. pneumoniae species [OR 10.96 (2.93-41.0)] were independent predictive factors for ESBL-PE pneumonia in colonized patients, whereas receipt of >2 days of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid during the ICU stay [OR 0.24 (0.08-0.71)] was protective. Patients with ESBL-PE pneumonia had a higher SOFA score (p = 0.037) and more frequent septic shock at pneumonia onset (p = 0.047). However, ESBL-PE pneumonia was not an independent predictor of mortality. Twenty-five patients had pneumonia caused by CRB. Chronic renal insufficiency, administration of third-generation cephalosporin within the past 3 months, acute respiratory distress syndrome before pneumonia and prior therapy with a carbapenem or fluoroquinolones were associated with CRB pneumonia in this selected population.
3:::SSB intake (100 g/d) was associated with higher BMI (β = 0.06 kg/m(2); P = 0.001) and WC (β = 0.19 cm; P < 0.001). A linear trend with BMI and WC also was seen when SSB intake was examined as categories of servings per day (Ptrend ≤ 0.001). Replacing SSB with water, coffee/tea, or milk was inversely associated with BMI (β = -0.07 to -0.09 kg/m(2); P < 0.001) and WC (β = -0.25 to -0.28 cm; P < 0.001).
4:::ω-3 PUFAs may have a therapeutic role in decreasing pain associated with RA, with doses of 3 to 6 g/d appearing to have a greater effect. Due to the limitations identified in the RCTs included in this review, more research is needed to investigate ω-3 PUFAs in larger populations and over extended periods of time.
2:::MBP was chronically administered to mice in their drinking water for 3 wk, and body weight, water intake, and bone mineral density were measured. Additionally, plasma bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b, and ghrelin concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To examine the direct effect of MBP on ghrelin secretion, gastric tissue culture and primary mucosal cells were stimulated by MBP.
3:::We found significant differences in the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale between patients who had and had not received respite admission. Qualitative analysis of the data indicated that respite admission was a contributory factor in continuing and stabilizing home care. Limited provision of social services and hospital care quality were barriers to respite admission.
2:::This prospective study compared initial staging and response evaluation at EOT. One hundred eighty-one patients were randomly assigned to either ceCT64 or FDG PET/ceCT. A nuclear medicine physician and a radiologist read FDG PET/ceCT scans independently and achieved post hoc consensus, whereas another independent radiologist interpreted ceCT64 separately. The reference standard included all clinical information, all tests, and follow-up. Ethics committees of the participating centers approved the study, and all participants provided written consent.
3:::One hundred forty-four cases of PRMTs were included in this analysis. Eighty-nine percent occurred in women. Most of the PRMTs were found to be malignant (53%). No preoperative factors predicting tumor dignity were identified by multiple regression analysis. Five-year disease specific survival of patients with benign and borderline tumors was excellent, reaching 100%, whereas it was only 68% for patients with malignant disease. Adjuvant surgical treatments including hysterectomy, salpingoophorectomy, and lymph node dissection were not associated with a statistically significant survival advantage. However, there was a nonsignificant association of hysterectomy with improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-2.07; P = 0.285). Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with reduced survival (hazard ratio 3.791; 95% confidence interval, 1.509-9.526; P = 0.0046).
4:::Adenocarcinoma is associated with a poorer prognosis and a greater probability of distanat recurrence compared with SCC. Different therapeutic strategies for ADC need to be developed, and when considering the greater tendency for distant recurrence in patients with ADC, systemic chemotherapy may have a role in reducing the risk of hematogenous spread.
2:::Using data from the 2012 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance interviews with persons who inject drugs across 20 US cities (n = 10,171), we conducted latent class analysis to identify injection risk classes and assess the relationship between engagement in prevention services and injection-related risk behavior. We conducted stratified analyses to examine the consistency of these associations across different geographical regions.
3:::Overall, 2042 (11.9%) participants were classified as MSMW. MSMW were less likely than MSMO to have condomless sex with male partners [aPR 0.77; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74 to 0.81] and to have been diagnosed with another sexually transmitted disease (aPR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.72 to 0.95). MSMW were more likely than MSMO to have given money or drugs for sex (aPR 2.85; 95% CI: 2.52 to 3.24) or received money or drugs for sex (aPR 2.64; 95% CI: 2.37 to 2.93) and to ever have injected drugs (aPR 2.05; 95% CI: 1.80 to 2.34). MSMW had more total sex partners (median 6, interquartile range: 4-11 vs. 3, 2-8), casual sex partners (5, 2-10 vs. 3, 1-7), and condomless sex partners (2, 1-4 vs. 1, 0-2) in the last 12 months (P < 0.01 for all comparisons).
4:::Our data indicate the importance of both subcutaneous and subfascial fat in relationship to glucose and lipid metabolism.
3:::Data demonstrated that angiogenesis was inhibited by the WEVEP in zebrafish (from 100µg/mL to 250µg/mL, p < 0.0001) and in the HUVEC model (from 100µg/mL to 400µg/mL, p < 0.0001). In the zebrafish model, the mean vessel numbers of administered groups were 26.00 ± 1.29 (100µg/mL), 24.54 ± 2.20 (150µg/mL), 22.66 ± 2.68 (200µg/mL), 20.80 ± 1.75 (250µg/mL), compared to 27.67 ± 0.96 of control group. Relative quantitative gene expression in zebrafish treated with WEVEP demonstrated that only VEGFR3 was significantly increased and other 23 genes including Met, VEGFA, Flt-1 were significantly decreased.
2:::In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients aged at least 18 years with ALK-rearranged stage IIIB or IV non-small-cell lung cancer (with at least one measurable lesion) who had received previous chemotherapy (one or two lines, including a platinum doublet) and crizotinib and had subsequent disease progression, from 99 centres across 20 countries. Other inclusion criteria were a WHO performance status of 0-2, adequate organ function and laboratory test results, a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks, and having recovered from previous anticancer treatment-related toxicities. We randomly allocated patients (1:1; with blocking [block size of four]; stratified by WHO performance status [0 vs 1-2] and presence or absence of brain metastases) to oral ceritinib 750 mg per day fasted (in 21 day treatment cycles) or chemotherapy (intravenous pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) [investigator choice], every 21 days). Patients who discontinued chemotherapy because of progressive disease could cross over to the ceritinib group. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed by a masked independent review committee using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 in the intention-to-treat population, assessed every 6 weeks until month 18 and every 9 weeks thereafter. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01828112, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients.
3:::Mitral valve (MV) prolapse was observed in 23% of our DM1 patients vs. 8.5% of HCs (p < 0.05). Left ventricle (LV) systolic dysfunction was observed in 6% of patients and none of the HCs (p < 0.05). Frequency of diastolic dysfunction showed no significant difference between DM1 patients and HCs (8.1% vs. 15.5%, p > 0.05). Systolic dysfunction was more common in patients with severe electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormality (18.8% vs. 2.7%, p < 0.01).
4:::These findings suggest nuanced associations between financial strain and HRQoL. We discuss the implications for prevention and intervention programs.
2:::Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to analyze VPA data from the Utah Higher Education Health Behavior Survey, a descriptive cross-sectional survey conducted in 2003 (N = 4574), 2005 (N = 9673) and 2007 (N = 7938).
3:::A total of 180 patients were included, of which 110 for the reliability analysis. Fifty-nine patients (33%) had neuropathic pain according to the reference test. Both the painDETECT and DN4 had moderate sensitivity of respectively 75% (95% CI: 61.6-85.0) and 76% (95% CI: 63.4-86.4) and poor specificity of respectively 51% (95% CI: 42.0-60.4) and 42% (95% CI: 33.2-51.5). Combining negative test results for both screening tools increased the sensitivity up to 83% (95% CI: 71.0-91.6). The ICC for the painDETECT was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86-0.94) and for the DN4 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.91).
4:::Familiarity with and use of data sharing projects was high among GPs and PMs. Both their individual and organisational characteristics were associated with the reported frequency of discussions and patients responses. Improved awareness of the impact of provider characteristics and attitudes on patients' decisions about data sharing may enhance the equity and autonomy of those decisions.'
2:::We analyzed clinic-level survey data collected in 2006-2007 from 170 VA primary care clinics. We examined four user-centered design practices: 1) pilot testing, 2) provider satisfaction assessment, 3) formal usability assessment, and 4) analysis of impact on performance improvement. We used a regression model to evaluate the association between user-centered design practices and the perceived utility of clinical decision support, while accounting for other important factors at those clinics, including implementation climate, available resources, and structural characteristics. We also examined associations separately at community-based clinics and at hospital-based clinics.
3:::The proposed method was able to identify 23 possible issues in the original document (ambiguities, omissions, redundant information, and inaccuracies, among others). The formal verification process aided the specialists to consider a wider range of usage scenarios and to identify which instructions form the kernel of the proposed SOP and which ones represent additional or required knowledge that are mandatory for the correct application of the medical document.
1:::The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between serum glucose levels and intraocular pressure (IOP) both in subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) as well as in subjects with diabetes mellitus (DM).
3:::According to Angles classification of malocclusion, it was found that 37.6% of all participants presented malocclusion. Class II malocclusion was the most common form of malocclusion in both groups, whereas class III cases were present almost exclusively in ID group (91.7%). The mean DAI score was 30.85 (± 13.7), being higher in the ID group (32.80) than in the control group (27.81; p = 0.003). A total of 45 (22.3%) participants had DAI scores of 36 and above, which indicate a handicapping malocclusion requiring mandatory orthodontic treatment. From those needing mandatory orthodontic treatment, the majority (84.4%) belonged to ID group. Mandibular irregularity (56.4%) and incisal segment crowding (45%) were the most common features of the malocclusion. Linear regression indicates that having an intellectual disability predicts severe or very severe malocclusion.'
4:::In this study, the prevalence of malocclusion was found to be higher and more severe in intellectual disabled participants. The dental practitioner should understand the particular relevance of this problem especially in patients with intellectual disabilities where impaired oral functions and poor appearance may further complicate oral health and increase negative social responses.
2:::Between 2001 and 2015, 91 patients with metachronous pulmonary metastases underwent curative surgical resection at five centers. Patients with stage IV at diagnosis were excluded. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from pulmonary resection until death. The disease-free interval (DFI) was defined as the time from pulmonary resection until recurrence or death.
3:::The sexual maturation of untreated rats was set at 90 days old. This sexual maturation was indicated by the simultaneous elevation of gonadotropins (FSH and LH (p<0.01)) and ovarian hormones (estradiol (p<0.001) and progesterone (p<0.05)) in animals aged 90 days. Uterine and vaginal growths (p < 0.001) observed in these animals appear as the result of elevated level of estradiol. The root aqueous extract of Milicia excelsa displayed genistein-like effects and increased FSH and estradiol serum levels following both treatment periods (7 and 15 days). Estradiol serum concentration significantly increased following a 7-day treatment at the dose of 14mg/kg BW (p<0.001). This resulted in an increase in the uterine wet weight, uterine and vaginal epithelial heights (p<0.05). These results suggest that the root aqueous extract of Milicia excelsa reduced rats sexual maturation from 90 to 52 days. Moreover, animals' body weight was not affected following treatment with Milicia excelsa.'
2:::We conducted a cross-sectional study in which women with symptoms of vaginitis were recruited at ten clinical centers and consented to the investigation between May and September 2015. The woman collected a vaginal swab, sheathed, and then handed it to the clinician. These swabs were to evaluate how self-collected swabs compared with clinician-collected swabs. The clinician collected an investigational test swab and reference test swabs. From 1,740 symptomatic patients, clinician-collected and self-collected vaginal swabs were evaluated by the molecular test and six tests. The reference methods for bacterial vaginosis were Nugents score and Amsel's criteria for intermediate Nugent results. The reference methods for Candida infection were isolation of any potential Candida microorganisms from inoculation of two culture media: chromogenic and Sabouraud agar and sequencing. The reference methods for trichomoniasis were wet mount and culture.'
3:::For clinician-collected swabs, by reference methods, bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed in 56.5%, vaginal candidiasis in 32.8%, trichomoniasis in 8%, and none of the three infections in 24% with a coinfection rate of 20%. The investigational test sensitivity was 90.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 88.3-92.2%) and specificity was 85.8% (95% CI 83.0-88.3%) for bacterial vaginosis. The investigational test sensitivity was 90.9% (95% CI 88.1-93.1%) and specificity was 94.1% (95% CI 92.6-95.4%) for the Candida group. Sensitivity for Candida glabrata was 75.9% (95% CI 57.9-87.8%) and specificity was 99.7% (95% CI 99.3-99.9%). Investigational test sensitivity was 93.1% (95% CI 87.4-96.3%) and specificity was 99.3% (95% CI 98.7-99.6%) for trichomoniasis. Results from self-collected swabs were similar to clinician-collected swabs.
3:::From October 2014 through February 2015, 4 groups of 5 raters blinded to surgeon skill level evaluated 6 different laparoscopic right colectomy videos (novice = 2, intermediate = 2, expert = 2). The overall Cronbach α was 0.98 (>0.9 = excellent internal consistency). The intraclass correlation for the overall assessment was 0.93 (range, 0.77-0.93) and was >0.74 (excellent) for each step. The average scores (scale, 1-5) for experts were significantly better than those in the intermediate category, with a mean (SD) of 4.51 (0.56) versus 2.94 (0.56; p = 0.003). Videos in the intermediate group scored more favorably than beginner videos for each individual step and overall performance (mean (SD) = 3.00 (0.32) vs 1.78 (0.42); p = 0.006).
4:::Anastomotic leakage after low anterior resection for rectal cancer was a frequent observed complication in this cohort. Differences in clinical outcome suggest that grade B and C leakage should be considered separate entities in future registrations. In patients with a diverting stoma, the chances of experiencing grade C anastomotic leakage were reduced. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A315.
2:::Longitudinal sections (7 μm) of enucleated eyes of healthy rats that received, by instillation, balanced salt solution with or without 10 mM of Y-27632 daily for 7 or 15 days, were subjected to the Feulgen reaction. Feulgen-stained nuclei of corneal and limbal epithelial cells were studied by microscopy and video image analysis to establish the nuclear size (area and perimeter), supraorganization of chromatin (texture and degrees of condensation), and the Feulgen-DNA amount.
3:::Mean daily consumption of Phe increased significantly after the first year of BH4 treatment in group 2 compared to group 1 (p<0.05). At the end of the first year of treatment with BH4, another dramatic difference observed between the two groups was the ability to transition to a Phe-free diet. Eight patients from group 2 and two from group 1 could quit dietary restriction.
2:::The validation cohorts included 849 patients from the NHLBI ARDSNet Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial (FACTT), 144 patients from a clinical trial of sivelestat for ARDS (STRIVE), and 545 ARDS patients from the VALID observational cohort study. To evaluate the performance of the prediction model, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), model discrimination, and calibration were assessed, and recalibration methods were applied.
3:::The biomarker/clinical prediction model performed well in all cohorts. Performance was better in the clinical trials with an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.70-0.79) in FACTT, compared to 0.72 (95% CI 0.67-0.77) in VALID, a more heterogeneous observational cohort. The AUC was 0.73 (95% CI 0.70-0.76) when FACTT and VALID were combined.
4:::Quality of life was most affected at mental dimension and physical dimension, mainly in patients at induction and palliative treatment. The results showed that the objectives of care aimed to reduce symptoms and maintain patient comfort are not achieved.
2:::This study assessed the prevalence of respiratory symptoms, confirmed pulmonary TB, and associated socio-economic factors among indigenous Paraguayan populations. Indigenous persons residing in selected communities were included in the study. A total of 24,352 participants were interviewed at home between October and December 2012. Respiratory symptomatic individuals were defined as those with respiratory symptoms of TB. A hierarchical Poisson regression analysis was performed with four levels: individual characteristics, living conditions and environmental characteristics, source of food, and type of nutrition.
3:::Compared with the control group, the DA group had statistically significant improvements in knowledge about pregnancy and epilepsy (Cohens d = 1.24; 95%CI = 0.77 to 1.83) and reduced decisional conflict (Cohen's d = 0.59; 95%CI = 0.21 to 0.99). Changes in decision self-efficacy, certainty of choice, patient-practitioner communication abilities and value congruence with choice were comparable between the DA and control group. Importantly, women's decisions about motherhood were not biased towards either direction, and there were no adverse effects on depression or anxiety. All women who received the DA indicated they would recommend it to other WWE.'
2:::In a cross-sectional study, data were collected from May 2015 to January 2016 among 60 women aged 30-59 years who were not pregnant, provided informed consent, had not been screened in 2 years, had no history of pre-cancer treatment, and did not attend a scheduled HPV screening. Participants completed questionnaires and received educational information before being given an opportunity to self-sample with the Hybrid Capture 2 High Risk HPV DNA Test.
3:::Self-sampling was accepted by 41 (68%) participants. Almost all women chose to self-sample because the process was easy (40/41, 98%), could be performed at home (40/41, 98%), and saved time (38/41, 93%), and because they felt less embarrassed (33/41, 80%). The most common reason for declining the test was not wanting to be screened (8/19, 42%). The prevalence of high-risk HPV types among women who accepted self-sampling was 17% (7/41).
4:::Our findings suggest that endometrial thickness is an additional ART-related factor influencing neonatal birth weight. This finding should be confirmed in large cohort studies.
3:::Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging data showed that postischemic MRE-269 treatment significantly reduced infarct volume compared with vehicle-treated rats at both 48 hours and 3 weeks after stroke. MRE-269 treatment resulted in a significant long-term recovery in both locomotor and somatosensory functions after middle cerebral artery occlusion, which was associated with a reduced weight loss in animals receiving the IP receptor agonist. Postischemic MRE-269 treatment reduced proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and oxidative stress. Damage to the blood-brain barrier, as assessed by extravasation of immunoglobulin G to the ischemic brain, was significantly reduced by MRE-269, which was associated with a reduction in matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity in the brain of stroked aged rats given the IP agonist at 4.5 hours after ischemia onset.
4:::FRAIL and CFS are simple frailty measures that may identify older adults at highest risk of adverse outcomes of hospitalization. FRAIL performed better in predicting in-hospital mortality.
2:::This was an explorative, semistructured interview-based study with 21 participants from all four thoracic surgery centers in Denmark that perform VATS lobectomy. Data analysis was deductive, and directed content analysis was used to code the text into the Oxford Non-Technical Skills system for evaluating operating teams non-technical skills.'
3:::The following factors were most strongly associated with a lower QoL: characteristics of AD lesions (Spearman Rs = 0.61-0.69, P < 0.01), a higher SA-EASI score (Rs = 0.54, P < 0.01) and a larger number of different topical AD prescriptions (Rs = 0.38, P < 0.01). The following factors were correlated with more severe AD: age (Rs = -0.36, P < 0.01), larger number of different TCS preparations used (Rs = 0.27, P < 0.05) and larger number of TCS prescriptions (Rs = 0.25, P < 0.05).
1:::The utility of perfusion-weighted imaging in multiple sclerosis (MS) is not well investigated. The purpose of this study was to compare baseline normalized perfusion measures in subgroups of newly diagnosed MS patients. We wanted to test the hypothesis that this method can differentiate between groups defined according to disease severity and disease activity at 1 year follow-up.
2:::All dermatology inpatients from January 2010 to May 2015 were analyzed. Bullous pemphigoid cases were identified based on clinical features and consistent histopathologic and direct immunofluorescence findings. Patients with other autoimmune bullous skin disorders were excluded. An equal number of inpatients with other skin conditions were selected randomly as age- and sex- matched controls.
3:::Rural patients and patients travelling farther to the GP had better 3-year survival. When the travel outcome associations were explored using interaction terms, the associations differed between rural and urban areas. Longer travel in urban areas significantly reduced the odds of emergency admissions (odds ratio [OR] 0.62, P<0.05), and increased survival (hazard ratio 0.75, P<0.05). Longer travel also increased the odds of presenting with alarm symptoms in urban areas; this was nearly significant (OR 1.34, P = 0.06). Presence of alarm symptoms reduced the likelihood of emergency admissions (OR 0.36, P<0.01).
3:::107 HIV+ and 147 HIVU children met inclusion criteria. In the HIV + cohort 17.8% had evidence of TM perforations and 8.4% had otorrhea. In the HIVU group 2.7% had a TM perforation and 0% had otorrhea. Hearing was significantly worse in HIV + children. (Audiologist determination: 38.3% HL HIV+, 12.2% HIVU, Fishers-Exact-Test OR: 4.5, 95% CI 2.4-8.3, p-value <0.0001; Worse-hearing-ear PTA > 40 dB: 19.6% HL HIV+, 6.1% HIVU, OR: 3.7, 95% CI 1.7-8.4, p-value <0.001).'
2:::An 8 month old with proximal esophageal atresia and distal TEF underwent endoscopic closure of a recurrent TEF. The fistula was approached endotracheally utilizing Bugbee electrocautery (EC) and endoluminally through the esophagus using argon plasma coagulator and placement of porcine submucosa graft into the tract. Current literature review is presented with a synthesis of data on cases utilizing endoscopically applied EC and the combined results of this closure technique.
4:::TPLS-5 is the first and only language test in our country that can evaluate receptive and/or expressive language skills of children aged between 0-7 years 11 months. Results of the study show that TPLS-5 is a valid and reliable language test for the Turkish children.
3:::Patients with a rapid onset of dementia within one, respective three following DBS showed significant higher WML volumes compared to cognitive normal and MCI patients (55.8cm(3)±18.836 vs. 9.3cm(3)±12.2; p=0.002). The same significant association was found in a multivariable model, including the covariables age, gender and PD disease duration (p=0.01). WML volume was associated to the rate of decline in cognitive composite score within three years after DBS surgery (p=0.006; R(2)=0.40) after correction for age.
2:::A retrospective review was performed. Preoperative and postoperative apnea-hypopnea indices (AHIs) were compared to determine OSA treatment success.
3:::The recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 5 years showed a significant difference between 3 groups: patients with circumferential resection margin (CRM) ≤1 mm, CRM 1.1 to 5 mm, and CRM >5 mm (46.2% vs 68.6% vs 77.5%, P<.001). Patients with CRM ≤1 mm showed a significantly higher cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence (P<.001) and distant metastasis (P<.001) at 5 years compared with the other 2 groups. Patients with CRM 1.1 to 5 mm showed a significantly higher cumulative incidence of distant metastasis (P<.001), but not locoregional recurrence (P=.192), compared with those with CRM >5 mm. Distal resection margin (≤5 vs >5 mm) did not show any significant difference in cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence (P=.310) and distant metastasis (P=.926).
4:::We validated that a combination of mean lung dose, pre IL-8 level, and TGF-β1 2w/pre ratio provided a more accurate model to predict the risk of RILT2 compared with MLD alone.
3:::A total of 208 (27%) household surveys were completed and returned. This school closure caused difficulties to 36 (17%) households; uncertain duration of closure, childcare arrangements, and lost pay were the most often reported difficulties. Having 1 adult in the household losing pay and household income below $25,000 were significantly associated with overall difficulty during this school closure. Concern about student health and safety was the most frequent theme in school administrator interviews.
2:::A community-based intervention provided administrators and teachers with a training on evidence-based public health and then collaborated with them to identify and implement environmental (walking track) and local school policy interventions (brain breaks). The evaluation included conducting in-depth interviews and SOPLAY observations to assess the facilitators and barriers and impact of the dissemination of environmental and policy changes.
4:::Active dissemination of environmental and policy interventions by engaging school administrators and teachers in planning and implementation shows potential for increasing physical activity in rural school settings.
1:::The aim of this study is to study the age, gender and lateral asymmetry-related white matter changes of long association tracts throughout late childhood and adolescence into adulthood using diffusion tensor tractography (DTT).
3:::Two copies of haplotype D in the UGT2B7 gene increased venous thrombosis risk (ORLETS: 3.78; ORMEGA: 2.61) as well as SHBG levels (mean difference 27.6nmol/L, 95%CI: -61.7 to 116.9 compared with no copies) in oral contraceptive users and not in non-users. In oral contraceptive users, haplotype A and B in the CYP3A4 gene were associated with venous thrombosis risk, but not in non-users; however, the effect on SHBG levels was not directional with the risk. None of the other haplotypes were associated with venous thrombosis.
2:::The study included 765 cases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma matched with 831 controls. Risk perceptions and beliefs of cases and controls were compared using Chi(2) tests and differences in dietary reports were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA.
4:::Higher PS was found using Osstell™ device in implants with double thread design (PHIA) in comparison to implants with single thread design (PHI) in D3 bone.
3:::34 oral lichen sclerosus cases with histological confirmation and one clinicopathologic study linked with this disease were found in literature. Oral lichen sclerosus affected most commonly female patients, were asymptomatic and not associated to skin or genital lesions. Furthermore, affected patients in a range of 7 - 70-years old (Average age = 31.81).
2:::The ""seed, environment, and soil"" medical hypothesis was first raised, following review of the literatures, to demonstrate the possible causes of persistence or recurrence of SHPT after parathyroidectomy. Subsequently, the novel surgical strategy of PPTX was proposed, which involves comprehensive resection of the fibro-fatty tissues, including visible or invisible parathyroid, within the region surrounded by the thyroid cartilage, bilateral carotid artery sheath, and the brachiocephalic artery. The perioperative information and clinical outcomes of patients who underwent PPTX from June 2016 to December 2016 were analyzed.
3:::We identified 88 operable patients among 661 patients with cT1-2N0M0 NSCLC. The median age was 79 years (range: 55-88). The median follow-up time after SBRT was 40 months (range: 4-121). Fifty-nine patients had been pathologically diagnosed and the other 29 had been clinically diagnosed as having NSCLC. Local control, cause-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) at 3 years were 91%, 97% and 90% for T1, and 100%, 82% and 74% for T2, respectively. The CSS and OS at 3 years were 100% and 100% for GGO and 83% and 59% for solid tumors, respectively (p=0.005). On univariate analysis, age and T stage were significantly associated with CSS, and age, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and opacity were significantly associated with OS. On multivariate analysis, age and CCI were significantly associated with OS. As for toxicities, Grades 0, 1, 2 and 3 radiation pneumonitis occurred in 37.5%, 47.7%, 13.6% and 1.1% of patients, respectively. No Grade 4 or 5 radiation pneumonitis occurred, and no other toxicities of Grade 2 or above were observed.
4:::This study identified heterogeneous traumatic stress symptom trajectories among civilians during a conflict, with different subgroups showing distinct response patterns over time, associated with various risk factors. Investigating responses to ongoing trauma, and identifying predictors of different stress symptom trajectories has clinical implications for the targeted delivery of interventions. Further exploration of heterogeneous trajectories could potentially elucidate mechanisms that drive resilience and recovery, including in situations of ongoing exposure such as during conflict.
3:::At this point, many material, informative, cognitive and emotional needs of young adults and their parents are not met. Obstacles, mainly organisational, persist and result in a particularly difficult transition to adulthood experience.
2:::Patients (≥18 years old) were identified from the Premier Research Database of US hospitals if they had any of the following types of elective surgical resections between 1/2008 and 12/2014: lung lobectomy, lower anterior resection of the rectum (LAR), liver wedge resection, or total hysterectomy. Cancer status was determined based on ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes. Operating room time (ORT), length of stay (LOS), and total hospital costs, as well as frequency of bleeding and infections during hospitalization were evaluated. The impact of cancer status on outcomes (from a hospital perspective) was evaluated using multivariable generalized estimating equation models; analyses were conducted separately for each resection type.
3:::The structural network was significantly disrupted in global and regional levels in both SVD groups. SVD+D group showed more severe impairment of global network efficiency, and lower nodal efficiency and less connections within multiple regions like hippocampus, amygdala and several cortical structures. The disruption of network connectivity was associated with depressive symptoms and MRI measures of SVD, however, no mediation effect of network efficiency was detected between MRI measures and depressive symptoms.
2:::A systematic literature review was conducted that included quantitative and qualitative studies. Quality assessment was made in accordance with Malteruds guidelines on qualitative research and Polit and Beck's guidelines on quantitative research. The analysis was guided by Patricia Benner's organisation of teaching as teaching and learning in classroom and skills laboratory and teaching and learning in clinical practice.'
3:::Social support was significantly associated with global cognitive function (β = .11, SE = .02, p < .001), episodic memory (β = .11, SE = .03, p < .001), working memory (β = .18, SE = .08, p < .05), and executive function (β = 1.44, SE = .37, p < .001). Social strain was significantly associated with global cognitive function (β = .23, SE = .05, p < .001), episodic memory (β = .27, SE = .07, p < .001), working memory (β = .34, SE = .17, p < .05), and executive function (β = 2.75, SE = .85, p < .01). In terms of sources of social support/strain, higher support from friends was significantly associated with higher global cognitive function (β = .04, SE = .02, p < .05), higher episodic memory (β = .05, SE = .02, p < .05), and higher executive function (β = .71, SE = .29, p < .05). Higher strain from spouse was significantly associated with higher global cognitive function (β = .10, SE = .03, p < .01), higher episodic memory (β = .11, SE = .04, p < .01), and higher executive function (β = 1.28, SE = .49, p < .01). Higher strain from friends was significantly associated with higher executive function (β = 3.59, SE = 1.17, p < .01).
4:::Social support and strain were associated with cognitive outcomes. Future longitudinal studies should be conducted.
2:::We used the data from the Population Study of ChINese Elderly in Chicago (PINE), a population-based survey of community-dwelling Chinese older adults in the Greater Chicago area. Grandparents with grandchildren younger than 16 years old were selected for present study (N = 2,775). Negative binominal regression and logistic regression models were used to test the relationships of grandparent caregiving time and psychological well-being measured by depressive symptoms and quality of life.
3:::Twenty-four eyes were included. Ganglion cell complex and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness did not show statistically significant changes through 12 months (55.6 ± 18.5 and 81.9 ± 9.9 μm at baseline, 52.7 ± 19.3 and 84.6 ± 15.5 μm at month 12, P > 0.05). Central macular thickness showed progressive decrease from baseline to month 12, with maximum reduction at month 3 (P < 0.001). Statistically significant reduction in choroidal thickness was registered in the nasal 500, 1000, and 1,500 μm from the fovea, corresponding to the papillomacular region (from 169.6 ± 45.3 to 153.9 ± 46.9, P < 0.001).
2:::Eight hundred ninety-eight women in the intervention arms of a randomized trial assessing the effectiveness of an integrated online and mobile phone behavioral intervention to decrease the prevalence of excessive GWG were included in this secondary analysis. Data were analyzed using χ(2) analysis and modified Poisson and linear regression approaches.
4:::Electronic tracking of GWG is an effective component of electronic and mobile health interventions aiming to decrease the prevalence of excessive GWG in not-low-income women. Income group-specific motivators are needed to increase the prevalence of GWG tracking.
3:::Among NYC residents, 8,827 HCC cases were diagnosed during 2001-2012. Significant clustering was detected in the HCC rates (Morans I = 0.25) with the strongest clustering found in HCC patients with comorbid HCV infection (Moran's I = 0.47). Poverty and uninsured status were associated (p < 0.05) with increased rates of HCC patients with HBV or HCV infection. Neighborhoods with high rates of HCC without viral hepatitis infection had lower rates of poverty and uninsured status.'
2:::We simultaneously recorded multichannel EEG, median nerve SEPs, and flash VEPs during the first few postnatal days in 50 term newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. EEG background was scored into five grades and the worst two grades were considered to indicate poor cerebral recovery. Evoked potentials were classified as absent or present. Clinical outcome was determined from the medical records at a median age of 21months. Unfavorable outcome included cerebral palsy, severe mental retardation, severe epilepsy, or death.
3:::The accuracy of outcome prediction was 98% with SEPs compared to 90% with EEG. EEG alone always predicted unfavorable outcome when it was inactive (n=9), and favorable outcome when it was normal or only mildly abnormal (n=17). However, newborns with moderate or severe EEG background abnormality could have either favorable or unfavorable outcome, which was correctly predicted by SEP in all but one newborn (accuracy in this subgroup 96%). Absent VEPs were always associated with an inactive EEG, and an unfavorable outcome. However, presence of VEPs did not guarantee a favorable outcome.
4:::Individuals with effort-reward imbalance at work have an increased risk of coronary heart disease, and this appears to be independent of job strain experienced. These findings support expanding focus beyond just job strain in future research on work stress.
3:::All isolates of S. maltophilia were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole and colistin, and only 1 (6.2%) isolate was resistant against ceftazidime. The MIC50/MIC90 of ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, colistin and ceftazidime was 0.25/0.38 mg/mL, 0.125/0.19 mg/mL, 0.25/0.38 mg/mL, and 2/4 mg/mL, respectively. Genotypic analysis of ERIC-PCR results revealed two distinct types of pattern. Interestingly, the only ceftazidime resistant isolate showed different patterns with other isolates.
2:::Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify, from individual and work-related characteristics, factors significantly associated with appropriate vaccination status.
1:::The purpose of this paper is to discuss the challenges of the upcoming policy change in the field of clinical drug trials due to the shift from the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC to the new Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014, adopted in 2014. Although it is expected that the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation will increase Europes competitiveness in clinical research, the paper argues that some measures to assure protection of research subjects should be taken before the Regulation comes into application in 2018.'
4:::In 2002-2013, the incidence of stroke in China increased rapidly. Combined with a high prevalence, a trend toward a younger age, and stable mortality, this finding suggests that additional clinical and behavioral interventions for metabolic and lifestyle risk factors are necessary to prevent stroke, particularly in certain populations.
3:::Untreated patients had increased body cell mass (113 ± 9% of predicted) and ECW (110 ± 20%) and decreased BF (67 ± 7.6%). At one-year follow-up, serum concentration of IGF-I was reduced and body composition had normalized. At baseline, isometric muscle strength in knee flexors and extensors was normal and concentric strength was modestly increased whereas grip strength and endurance was reduced. After one year, muscle strength was normal in both patients with still active disease and patients in remission. At long-term follow-up, all patients were in remission. Most muscle function tests remained normal, but isometric flexion and the fatigue index were increased to 153 ± 42% and 139 ± 28% of predicted values, respectively.
2:::Three patients with megalencephaly, diffuse asymmetric overgrowth, hypoketotic, hypoinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia and no AKT2 mutation underwent further genetic, clinical and metabolic investigation. Signalling in dermal fibroblasts from one patient and efficacy of the mTOR inhibitor Sirolimus on pathway activation were examined. Finally, the metabolic profile of a cohort of 19 further patients with mosaic activating mutations in PI3K was assessed.
4:::In this study, LUTS appear to be more frequent in male MND patients, but are not related to age, clinical or genetic characteristics. When reported early, LUTS could be a sign of rapid disease spread and poor prognosis. Further prospective longitudinal and neuroimaging studies are warranted to confirm this hypothesis.
2:::We searched PubMed for relevant observational studies. Random effects models with DerSimonian-Laird weights were used to investigated the association between CMBs presence at baseline MRI and ICH or ischaemic stroke during follow-up.
3:::Among the women interviewed (mean age 20.4 ± 1.45 years), 146 (41.8%) had experienced sexual harassment in the previous 12 months: 91 (26.1%) level 1 and 55 (15.7%) level 2. The frequency of premenstrual symptoms was 31.9% ( n=110); heavy bleeding, 35.3% ( n=124); pain, 51.4% ( n=181); irregular cycles, 55.5% ( n=195); and amenorrhea, 6.7% ( n=23). After adjustment for age, place of birth, being in a couple relationship and receiving hormone therapy, the frequency of menstrual disorders, except for amenorrhea, was increased with sexual harassment, with a regular gradient from no harassment to level 2 harassment. Introducing factors of depression, specific gynaecological problems and lifetime sexual violence did not change the results. For instance, the adjusted odds ratios of premenstrual symptoms were 2.10 [1.19-3.68] for women with level 1 harassment and 3.58 [1.83-7.03] for women with level 2 compared with women without harassment exposure.
3:::Twelve months after the initial treatment, a total of 24 (80%) patients in the TAC group and 23 (82.1%) patients in the CTX group achieved remission (either partial or complete remission). The survival curve of the probability of remission and complete remission were similar between the two groups (p > .05). Proteinuria (based on 24 h urinary protein excretion) was significantly decreased, and serum albumin was significantly increased after immunosuppressive treatment in both the groups. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was comparable between before and after treatment. The main adverse effects in TAC treatment were glucose intolerance, diabetes and abnormal aminotransferase.
4:::Long-term survival was reduced in patients with AIH. No gender difference regarding prognosis was seen but men died younger, probably as a result of earlier onset of disease. Cirrhosis at diagnosis was a risk factor for poor prognosis and the overall risk of liver-related death was increased.
2:::Four DPT students with the Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) credential voluntarily provided collegiate athletes strength and conditioning training. Students were interviewed to obtain their perceptions of how the experience impacted performance in DPT school and perceptions of anticipated future benefits.
3:::Overall, the prevalence of drug offers decreased significantly from 16.3% in 2002 to 12.3% in 2014, reflecting a 24.5% reduction in the relative proportion of adolescents who were offered drugs. While the decreasing trends were observed in all subgroups (e.g., race/ethnicity), the decreases were more limited among African-American and Hispanic youth than White youth. As a result, while no differences were observed at the outset of the study, a higher proportion of African-American and Hispanic adolescents were offered drugs between 2012 and 2014.
2:::Atherosclerotic plaques were induced in carotid arteries in ApoE-/- mice by perivascular collar placement. All mice were randomly divided into PBS and AG1296 groups. 3 weeks after the surgery, the carotid arteries were harvested for histological analysis.
3:::The Spanish version of the short FES-I showed good reliability and validity in an elderly Chilean population.
4:::Implant failure is a recognised complication of intramedullary nailing in cases of non-union. The increased rate of implant failure in our department required a change to a 130° CMN implant and a 3.2mm diameter guide wire for placement of the lag screw. We continue to monitor this difficult group of patients very closely.
3:::Reaching velocity decreased with abduction loading (p<0.001) such that velocity was 30% slower when lifting the arm at 50% of abduction strength compared to when arm weight was supported. Abnormal flexion synergy increased with abduction loading (p<0.001) such that normalized activation ranged from a median (interquartile range) of 0.07 (0.03-0.12) when arm weight was supported to 0.19 (0.12-0.40) when actively lifting (large effect size, d=0.59). Flexor spasticity was detected during reaching (p=0.016) but only when arm weight was supported (intermediate effect size, d=0.33).
2:::This prospective multicenter study was conducted in 2 gynecologic oncology centers between 2012 and 2014 (Institute for Maternal and Child Health IRCCS Burlo Garofolo in Trieste and Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome, Italy). We enrolled 153 patients diagnosed with clinical early (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages I-II) type I endometrial cancer.
4:::A conceptual framework of pathophysiological responses to passive muscle stretch is defined. This framework can be used in clinical assessment of hyper-resistance and will improve communication between clinicians. Components within the framework are defined by objective parameters from instrumented assessment. These parameters need experimental validation in order to develop treatment algorithms based on the aetiology of the clinical phenomena.
3:::Pepsinogen levels were highly correlated among the assays (pairwise Rhos: PgI≥0.84, PgII≥0.87; all P-values<.01). Based on manufacturers cutoffs, sensitivities, specificities and areas under the ROC curve for detecting moderate to severe histological corpus atrophy by PgI/PgII were 44%/91%/0.70, 56%/84%/0.76, and 52%/90%/0.77 for Biohit, Vector Best and Eiken, respectively. Cutoffs optimized by ROC or data mining analyses did not substantially improve test performance.'
2:::We carried out a retrospective cohort comparison of 69 neonates who underwent hybrid ductal stenting with balloon-expandable and self-expanding stents from December, 2005 to July, 2014.
3:::The functional study confirmed faster recovery of the regenerated axons in acetyl-L-carnitine treated than control group (P<0.05). The mean ratios of gastrocnemius muscles weight were measured. There was a statistically significant difference between the muscle weight ratios of SIL/ALC and SIL groups (P<0.05). Morphometric indices of regenerated fibers showed that the number and diameter of the myelinated fibers in SIL/ALC were significantly higher than in the control group. In immuohistochemistry, the location of reactions to S-100 in the SIL/ALC group was clearly more positive than in the SIL group.
4:::Liquid-based endometrial cytology can be considered a useful method for detecting of endometrial pathology as a first-line approach.
3:::Chi-square test found that Edmondson-Steiner grade and satellite nodule were significantly associated with recurrence, while the former was the single marker for early recurrence. Stepwise logistic regression analysis demonstrated the independent predictive role of Edmondson-Steiner grade for recurrence. On the other hand, Edmondson-Steiner grade, serum AFP level and satellite nodule were significant for overall and disease-free survival in univariate analysis, whereas tumor size was linked to disease-free survival. Of the variables, Edmondson-Steiner grade, serum AFP level and satellite nodule were independent indicators.
2:::A systematic review of the literature was conducted using MEDLINE, Scopus, PubMed and the Cochrane library. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported the incidence of pedestrian injury in a defined population from a high-income country defined using the World Bank atlas method for the 2016 fiscal year. A meta-analysis was performed on the population incidence of pedestrian traffic injury by world region.
3:::There was a strong longitudinal effect of the ERI ratio, as well as of its subcomponents, and OC on somatic symptoms (all Bs≥|0.49|; p-values ≤0.004). Moreover, the ERI ratio×OC interaction was significant (p-value=0.047). Multiple mediation analyses revealed especially anxiety to mediate the effect of work stressors on somatic symptoms (Sobel test=0.007).
2:::MRC National Survey of Health and Development study members reported sleep quality at age 68 (n=2446). Cumulative exposure to and changes in positive and negative support were derived from data at age 53, 60-64 and 68years. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores were regressed on social support measures adjusted for i) gender only then additionally ii) education, marital status, number in household, limiting illness, body mass index, caregiving, iii) and affective symptoms.
4:::Our real-life prospective cohort showed the higher cumulative incidence of thiopurine withdrawal due to AEs reported to date. Switching from AZA to 6-MP was often ineffective.
3:::Results reported from three RCTs involving 1,887 patients are included in this analysis. Indirect comparison between pembrolizumab and nivolumab in advanced NSCLC shows no statistically significant difference in ORR (OR: 1.14, 95% CI, 0.60-2.01), OS (HR: 0.98, 95% CI, 0.35-2.74) and PFS (HR: 1.12, 95% CI, 0.70-1.77). The incidence of grades≥3 adverse effects is higher with pembrolizumab as compared with nivolumab (OR: 3.44, 95% CI, 1.87-6.32). There are no significant statistical differences between severe adverse effects, such as pneumonitis and hypothyroidism, of the two drugs.
2:::The study included 136 post-STEMI patients, 96 men and 40 women, aged 60.1 ± 11.8 years, admitted for cardiac rehabilitation (phase II) to the Department of Internal Medicine and Cardiac Rehabilitation, WAM University Hospital in Lodz, Poland. On admission fasting blood cell count was performed and serum glucose and creatinine level was determined (GFR assessment). The following results were considered abnormal: glucose ⩾ 100 mg/dl, GFR < 60 ml/min/1, 73 m², red blood cells (RBCs) < 4 × 106/μl, white blood cells (WBCs) > 10 × 103/μl; platelets (PLTs) < 150 × 10³/ml. In all patients an exercise test was performed twice, before and after the completion of the second stage of rehabilitation, to assess its effects.
3:::In total, 78% (n = 72) of all Dutch hospitals participated in the survey. In these hospitals 16,471 female patients underwent a mastectomy for DCIS (n = 1,980) or invasive BC (n = 14,491) between 2011 and 2014. IBR was performed in 41% of patients with DCIS (hospital range 0-80%) and in 17% of patients with invasive BC (hospital range 0-62%). Hospital type, number of plastic surgeons available and attendance of a plastic surgeon at the MDT meeting increased IBR rates. For invasive BC, higher percentage of mastectomies and more weekly MDT meetings also significantly increased IBR rates. Adjusted data demonstrated decreased IBR rates for DCIS (average 35%, hospital range 0-49%) and invasive BC (average 15%, hospital range 0-18%).
4:::We conclude that adding the classification objective to the traditional auto-encoder objective and optimizing for finding Pareto-optimal solutions, using evolutionary multi-objective optimization, results in producing more discriminative features.
2:::The proposed algorithm combines a pre-processing step with subsequent stages that involve local processing techniques and a morphological reconstruction-based segmentation algorithm. Segmentation performance was assessed in three constructed image sets, comparing F-measure scores and AUC values (ROC analysis) for Bio-EdIP, its previous version and TScratch. Furthermore, segmentation results were compared with published algorithms using eight public benchmarks.
3:::By employing wavelet decomposition of the gait variables as an alternate method for the identification of Parkinsons subjects, the classification accuracy of 90.32% (Confidence Interval; 74.2%-97.9%) has been achieved, at par to recently reported accuracy, using only one gait parameter. Left stance interval performed equally good to Right swing interval showing classification accuracy of 90.32%. The classification accuracy improved to 100% when all the gait parameters from left leg were put together to form a larger feature vector. We have shown that Haar wavelet performed significantly better than db2 wavelet (p = 0.05) for certain gait variables e.g., right stride time series. The results show that wavelet analysis is a promising approach in reducing down the required number of gait variables, however at the cost of increased computations in wavelet analysis.'
3:::There were 620 dairy farmers in the analytical sample, with 50 medically-attended agricultural injuries observed during the 14-year study time period (5.7 injuries per 1000 dairy farmers per year). In the multivariable model, the odds of agricultural injury were significantly greater among farmers who have private individually-purchased health insurance (OR=4.25; 95% CI: 1.31, 13.84), do not live at their dairy operation (OR=2.91; CI: 1.27, 6.67), and do not provide safety training to their workers (OR=4.27; CI: 1.00, 18.21).
2:::All patients that underwent cardiopulmonary bypass at our institution (Jan 1, 2011 to Jun 30, 2016) were identified through our Society of Thoracic Surgery database. Pharmacy records identified patients receiving MB within 72 hours of cardiopulmonary bypass. Multivariate logistic regression identified predictors of major adverse events among patients receiving MB.
4:::The results indicate that sub-clinically level depressive symptoms influence the mothers affective facial expression during early face-to-face interaction with their infants. One of the clinical implications is to consider even sub-clinical depressive symptoms as a risk factor for mother-infant relationship disturbances.'
3:::Comparison of the results of the 10th day with the baseline: LDL-C, TG decreased significantly (P<0.01) in the observation group, while the control group did not have a significantly change (P>0.05). Comparison of observation group and control group: after treatment, LDL-C and TG decreased more significantly in the observation group than the control group (-27.2% vs -14.6%, P<0.05). Whether according to LDL-C <2.07mmol/L standard or LDL-C <1.8mmol/L standard, the compliance rate of the observation group was significantly better than the control group, the results were (69% vs 28.9%, P<0.05) and (47.6% vs 13.2% P<0.05), respectively. After 10days treatment, comparing to baseline, hs-CRP was significantly lowered in these two groups (P<0.01). And there is no liver and kidney toxicity, myopathy and other adverse reactions during treatment.
2:::We performed a MEDLINE-search and used manual cross-referencing for reports of antibiotic-induced mania and included cases in which a (hypo)manic episode was diagnosed in close temporal relationship with the prescription of an antibiotic.
4:::We demonstrated a severe vascular leakage and a pro-inflammatory pulmonary response in mechanically ventilated mice, which was enhanced by severe hyperoxia and longer duration of mechanical ventilation. Prolonged ventilation with high oxygen concentrations induced a time-dependent immune response characterized by elevated levels of neutrophils, cytokines, and chemokines in the pulmonary compartment.
3:::GCDCA-S and CDCA-24G were substrates for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and NTCP. The uptake of [(3)H]atorvastatin, GCDCA-S, and CDCA-24G by human hepatocytes was significantly inhibited by both rifampicin and pioglitazone, whereas that of taurocholate was inhibited only by pioglitazone. Rifampicin elevated plasma concentrations of GCDCA-S more than those of other bile acids. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve for GCDCA-S was 20.3 times higher in rifampicin-treated samples. CDCA-24G could be detected only in plasma from the rifampicin-treatment phase, and CDCA-3G was undetectable in both phases.
2:::Systematic literature searches were performed in PubMed and EMBASE. We included original studies comparing fetuses or newborns with congenital heart defects to reference fetuses or newborns with respect to brain biometrics, including biparietal diameter, brain volume, and head circumference at birth. The study characteristics and the results were extracted and presented in tables. No meta-analysis was undertaken.
3:::Both of the OCD groups exhibited topological alterations in the brain functional network characterized by abnormal small-world parameters at the beta band. However, the alterations at the theta band only existed in the OCD patients with poor insight.
4:::PrefHer revealed that switching from IV to SC trastuzumab (hand-held syringe or SID) or vice versa did not impact the known safety profile of trastuzumab.
2:::Thirteen subjects (initial age 5.8 ± 2.0 mos) with 15 IHs were enrolled. IHs were classified as proliferative, plateau phase, or involuting. Nine patients with 11 IHs were untreated; four patients with 4 IHs were treated with timolol or propranolol. Each IH was evaluated by placing the DOS system directly on the lesion as well a normal contralateral skin site. IH vascularity and oxygenation were scored using a newly defined normalized hypoxia fraction (NHF) coefficient. Measurements were recorded at various intervals from the initial visit to 1 to 2 years of age.
3:::For the nine untreated IHs, the NHF was highest at 6 months of age, during proliferation. Differences in NHFs between the proliferation and the plateau (p = 0.02) and involuting (p < 0.001) stages were statistically significant. In treated patients, the NHF normalized to 60% after 2 months. One treated IH came within 5% of the NHF for normal skin after 12 months.
1:::Prehospital transfusions are a novel yet increasingly accepted intervention in the adult population as part of remote damage control resuscitation, but prehospital transfusions remain controversial in children. Our purpose was to review our pediatric prehospital transfusion experience over 12 years to describe the safety of prehospital transfusion in appropriately triaged trauma and nontrauma patients.
3:::Three of the eight serum microRNAs,i.e., miR-1a, miR-26a, and miR-133, had significantly different expression profiles among the four groups. Spearmans correlation analysis showed that the relative expression level of miR-1a was positively correlated with free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4), and negatively related to thyroid stimulating hormone. Spearman's correlations analysis also revealed that the level of miR-1a was negatively correlated with a critical echocardiographic parameter (left atrial diameter), which was dramatically increased in GD + AF group compared to GD group. Furthermore, the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that, among the eight microRNAs, miR-1a had the largest area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves not only for discriminating between individuals with and without Graves' disease, but also for predicting the presence of atrial fibrillation in patients with Graves' disease.'
2:::Adult male miR-15a/16-1 knockout and wild-type mice, or adult male C57 BL/6J mice injected via tail vein with the miR-15a/16-1-specific inhibitor (antagomir, 30 pmol/g), were subjected to 1 hour of middle cerebral artery occlusion and 72 hours of reperfusion. The neurological scores, brain infarct volume, brain water content, and neurobehavioral tests were then evaluated and analyzed. To explore underlying signaling pathways associated with alteration of miR-15a/16-1 activity, major proinflammatory cytokines were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction or ELISA and antiapoptotic proteins were examined by Western blotting.
4:::Molecular testing elucidated the etiologies of most biochemically uncharacterized PAI patients. Genetic defects such as NR0B1 defects are presumed based on phenotypes, while others with broad phenotypic variability, such as STAR defects, are difficult to diagnose. Molecular testing is a rational approach to diagnosis in biochemically uncharacterized PAI patients.
3:::The dementia conversion rate was 57.4% in T2D patients vs. 42.6% in non-diabetic subjects (p=0.02). T2D and APOE ε4 allele were independent risk factors for developing dementia.
2:::We conducted preseason screenings for shoulder internal and external rotation ROM and humeral retrotorsion on 832 high school baseball players and tracked their exposure and incidence on throwing-related shoulder and elbow injuries during a subsequent season. Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to determine whether preseason screening could identify injury risk in baseball players and whether the injury risk was higher for pitchers compared with players who do not pitch.
3:::In the present experiemnt, two of the patients tested had pairs of alters where there was no interference from the material which was presented to the other alter. In one of these cases, there was breakthrough with one pairing of alters, a pattern matched in a subsidiary experiment.
2:::We tested the M4-selective positive allosteric modulators VU0152100 and VU0467154 in a drug discrimination assay and a conditioned place preference assay, including extinction and reinstatement of place preference. Specificity of the cocaine discrimination effect was verified using knockout mice lacking either M1 or M4 receptors (M1(-/-), M4(-/-)). We also replicated previous findings in cocaine-induced locomotor hyperactivity and striatal dopamine microdialysis assays.
3:::This study shows that mannitol alone (0.5gkg(-1)), and the combinations of furosemide (0.5mgkg(-1)) with different doses of mannitol (0.5gkg(-1)-1gkg(-1)) provides adequate brain relaxation. However, administration of furosemide with low or high doses of mannitol may cause reduction in the sodium and chloride levels as well as rise in the lactate level. Moreover it may cause high urine output and negative intra-operative fluid balance.
4:::Higher BMI, age, and comorbid disease were consistently identified as significant risk factors for functional decline among older individuals across all approaches and analyses.
2:::Expression of keratin 10 (K10), K14, K16, involucrin, filaggrin, Ki-67, and Melan-A was detected by immunohistochemistry in eight patients with SAK, seven patients with ichthyosis vulgaris (IV) and six healthy controls (HCs).
3:::Expression of K14, K16, involucrin and filaggrin was upregulated in patients with SAK compared with patients with IV and the HCs (P < 0.01-0.05), but K10 expression was similar for the three groups (P > 0.05). Numbers of Ki-67+ and Melan-A+ cells were higher in patients with SAK than in patients with IV and the HCs (P < 0.05).
3:::Corticosterone dose dependently decreased CETP mRNA in THP-1 macrophages. Corticosterone also decreased CETP mRNA expression after LXR pretreatment. In patients, CETP activity decreased with doubling of the HCT dose (P = 0·049), coinciding with an increase in HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I and the HDL cholesterol/apolipoprotein A-I ratio (reflecting HDL size; P < 0·01 for each). The increase in the HDL cholesterol/apolipoprotein A-I ratio was correlated with the decrease in plasma CETP activity (r = -0·442, P = 0·002).
2:::The protein binding of the various AEDs was undertaken in sera of 278 patients with epilepsy. Separation of the free non-protein-bound component was achieved by using ultracentrifugation (Amicon Centrifree Micropartition System) under set conditions: 500 μl serum volume; centrifugation at 1,000 g for 15 min, and at 25°C. Free and total AED concentrations were measured by use of fully validated liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) techniques.
4:::Cysteine seems to be an indispensable amino acid for HCEC growth and survival. Its necessity might reflect a high requirement for antioxidants to protect HCECs from oxidative stress, as HCECs have high aerobic metabolic activity.
1:::The purpose of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to determine if irrigation of breast implant pockets with antibiotics reduces the rate of capsular contracture (CC). Capsular contracture is the most common complication after primary augmentation mammoplasty, yet its etiology remains cryptogenic.
3:::Significant reduction of hepatic enzymes activity, systolic blood preasure, inflammatory markers and TAG levels were detected in both groups in comparison to the control group. Activity of SOD and GPx increased significantly after additive therapy. Coenzyme Q10 addition significantly reduced most of the abovementioned parameters (systolic blood preasure, total cholesterol, LDL, hsCRP, IL-6, SOD) in comparison with the statin+omega-3 PUFA group. The intensity of statin adverse effects were significantly reduced in the group with the addition of CoQ10.
2:::Data of 55 eligible patients with UCS who underwent preoperative ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT and surgical staging were analyzed retrospectively. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV₂.₅), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG₂.₅) of the primary tumors were measured using a SUV threshold of 2.5. The optimal cutoff value of each parameter was determined by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve, and its impact on progression-free survival and overall survival was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards model.
3:::At a mean follow-up of 20±11.7 months (range, 12-42 months), KSS scores improved significantly, from 46.7±5.2 preoperatively to 87±4.4 postoperatively (p<0.001), as did the Kujala score, from 44±8 preoperatively to 86.6±6.8 postoperatively (p<0.001). The WBL decreased significantly, from 76±7% preoperatively to 41±11% postoperatively (p<0.001). The FTA was improved significantly, from 12.7±1.7° preoperatively to 4±4° postoperatively (p<0.001), as was the mLDFA, from 83±4° preoperatively to 91±1.3° postoperatively (p<0.001).
1:::Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is indicated for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) B hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Whether TACE provides any long-term survival benefits remains unclear. We aimed to investigate micrometastases predictors with which to identify patients who would benefit from surgical resection (SR).
3:::During the 3-year follow-up period, the cumulative incidences of revascularization [target lesion revascularization: hazard ratio (HR), 2.40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-4.85; p=0.015, target vessel revascularization (TVR): HR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.69-6.58; p=0.001, non-TVR: HR, 5.64; 95% CI, 1.90-16.6; p=0.002] and major adverse cardiac events (MACE; HR, 3.32; 95% CI, 1.92-5.73; p<0.001) were significantly higher in the RAF group than the CF group. However, the 3-year incidences of death and myocardial infarction were not different between the two groups.
2:::From 1997 to 2016 we conducted a retrospective analysis from a prospective database. We described and analyzed 4 cut-points, 1997-2004, 2009, 2012 and 2016.
3:::Five out of 11 would have been diagnosed with 22q11.2DS without NBS, whereas early identification of 22q11.2DS in 6/11 led to the diagnosis of significant associated features including hypocalcemia, congenital heart disease (CHD), and gastroesophageal reflux disease that may have gone unrecognized and therefore untreated.
4:::Our findings support rapidly screening infants with a positive NBS for SCID, but without SCID, for 22q11.2DS even when typically associated features such as CHD are absent, particularly when B cells and NK cells are normal. Moreover, direct NBS for 22q11.2DS using multiplex qPCR would be equally, if not more, beneficial, as early identification of 22q11.2DS will obviate a protracted diagnostic odyssey while providing an opportunity for timely assessment and interventions as needed, even in the absence of T cell lymphopenia.
3:::Of the 1 017 691 men included in the cohort, 4310 developed bipolar disorder; 784, schizoaffective disorder; 4823, schizophrenia; and 5013, other nonaffective psychoses. After adjustment, with use of mean scores as a reference, low social maturity (hazard ratio [HR], 1.61; 95% CI, 1.48-1.74), low mental energy (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.24-1.44), and low emotional stability (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.40-1.63) were inversely associated with schizophrenia in a dose-dependent fashion. Other nonaffective psychoses displayed a similar pattern. Bipolar disorder was associated with high (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.09-1.35) and low (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01-1.25) social maturity and low emotional stability (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.46-1.78). Schizoaffective disorder was associated with low emotional stability (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.26-1.85).
2:::Patients with SCD who developed IPD from 2004 up to 2013 were identified using microbiology records. Descriptive analysis of presence of risk factors for IPD, type of SCD, pneumococcal vaccination and prophylaxis status, clinical presentation, microbiological data, and the outcome of IPD was performed.
3:::In the recirculation condition, partial recovery of contractile forces was observed for 60 minutes at 4%, 8%, and 12% LE. A contracture followed after exposure to 16% LE in some asystolic muscles. In the washout experiments, following asystole, LE (0.05%-12%) had no effect on the recovery time of the first and regular contractile responses. LE (0.1%-8%) restored contractility to baseline levels after 45 minutes; partial recovery was shown with lower (0.05%) and higher (12%) concentrations. Oxfenicine did not alter the recovery of contractile forces. Contractile depression was observed with 12% LE alone. Concentration-related reduction of tissue BPV concentration by LE was observed in both circulating conditions.
2:::Sequential cohorts of Western Australian (WA) opioid-dependent women treated with implant naltrexone, oral methadone or sublingual buprenorphine were identified via records from a drug and alcohol clinic (Subiaco, WA) for naltrexone and state prescribing records for methadone and buprenorphine. A control cohort of non-opioid-dependent women was obtained from the WA electoral roll. Identifying information and treatment records for these women were linked against the Midwife Notification System records to identify exposed offspring born between 2001 and 2011. Birth characteristics, congenital anomalies and perinatal mortality for all neonates were extracted from state records.
3:::Four maternal deaths occurred in the study group. The rates of pregnancies with composite maternal adverse outcome [42 vs 9% RR 4.6 (95% CI 2.5-8.4)] and composite perinatal adverse outcome [36 vs 17% RR 2.1, (95% CI 1.3-3.3)] were significantly more in ascites group than in control group. After adjusting for other confounding variables, ascites was independently associated with adverse maternal events [adjusted OR 16.40 (95% CI 2.88-93.31)] but not adverse perinatal outcome.
4:::Post-operative bleeding in the wound and inadequate drainage are the primary causes of SSEH. The severity of neurologic injury before haematoma evacuation was associated with the treatment outcome; therefore, it is important to have early diagnosis of SSEH to prevent progression of the neurologic injury.
1:::Common variable immunodeficiency disorder (CVID) is a primary immunodeficiency disease (PIDD) often associated with severe and chronic infections. Patients commonly receive immunoglobulin (Ig) treatment to reduce the cycle of recurrent infection and improve physical functioning. However, how Ig treatment in CVID affects quality of life (QOL) has not been thoroughly evaluated. The purpose of a recent Immune Deficiency Foundation (IDF) mail survey was to assess the factors that are associated with QOL in patients with CVID receiving Ig treatment.
2:::We analyzed administrative data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project for the state of California from 2007 to 2009 using a case-crossover design. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for combined hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke risk occurring within 15, 30, 90, 180, and 365 days of a hospitalization for a psychiatric diagnosis (as defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code) among adults.
3:::Statistical analysis by ANOVA and Tukeys test showed a significant decrease (p<0.05) in light transmittance with the addition of opacifiers to the experimental composite-resins. There was a linear correlation between different concentrations of TiO2 and Al2O3 and total transmittance. Total transmittance was also found to be wavelength dependent. The color differences for the concentrations of 0-1wt.% of the opacifiers were above 1 ΔE* unit, with Al2O3 showing the smallest color shift.'
2:::All adults initiating treatment in 2008/09 in all 149 local treatment systems reporting to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System (n=54,347). Admission polydrug use sub-populations were identified by Latent Class Analysis. The treatment outcome measure was successful completion and no re-presentation within six months' (SCNR) analysed by multilevel, multivariable logistic regression and funnel plots to contrast outcome by treatment system.'
4:::In the postpartum period, bipolar PPD is common, can be differentiated from unipolar PPD, and needs to be identified promptly in order to expedite appropriate treatment. Future studies on pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy should focus on the acute and preventative treatment of bipolar PPD.
3:::The prevalence rate of SSD was 36% at baseline and 62% at 12-months follow-up. The persistence rate of SSD was 82% and the incidence rate was high, leading to a markedly increased prevalence rate at follow-up. Risk factors for persistent SSD were a self-concept of bodily weakness (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.30-1.78) and an increase of depression during the study period (OR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02-1.22). Further, the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder (OR: 7.52, 95% CI: 1.17-48.23) or both anxiety and depressive disorder (OR: 23.14, 95% CI: 2.14-249.91) at baseline were significant predictors.
2:::In a multicenter retrospective study conducted in patients hospitalized from July 1, 2004, to July 1, 2014, we investigated functional long-term prognosis and identified prognosis factors of patients admitted in an intensive care unit (ICU) with prolonged neurological manifestations related to hypoglycemia. Eligible patients were adults admitted to the ICU with a Glasgow Coma Score <8 due to hypoglycemia and persistent consciousness disorders after normalizing blood glucose levels. Patients with possible other causes of consciousness disorders, previous cognitive disorders, hypothermia <35 °C or circulatory arrest within 24 h after ICU admission, were excluded. Follow-up phone call was used to determine patients functional outcome using modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at a minimum of 1-year follow-up with mRS 0-3 defining good and mRS 4-6 poor outcomes.'
3:::We followed 262 patients to 6 months, with a mean age of 59 ± 16 years, and of whom 175 (67%) were men. Moderate or severe disability was reported in 65 of 262 (25%). Predictors of disability included a history of anxiety/depression [odds ratio (OR) 1.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22, 2.23), P = 0.001]; being separated or divorced [OR 2.87 (CI 1.35, 6.08), P = 0.006]; increased duration of mechanical ventilation [OR 1.04 (CI 1.01, 1.08), P = 0.03 per day]; and not being discharged to home from the acute hospital [OR 1.96 (CI 1.01, 3.70) P = 0.04]. Moderate or severe disability at 6 months was associated with limitation in activities, e.g. not returning to work or studies due to health (P < 0.002), and reduced health-related quality of life (P < 0.001).
4:::Practice leads to improvements in endovascular simulator procedure and fluoroscopy times, especially for more novice trainees. Initial operator performance gaps can be approximated with a few sessions to expected proficiency. Incorporation of endovascular simulators in residency training may assist in shortening the learning curve in rarer endovascular procedures.
3:::The cases showed less frequent Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infections (45.1% versus 60.7%, p = .005), more frequent duodenal location (31.8% versus 19.1%, p = .009), and more frequent rebleeding (13.9% versus 5.8%, p = .02) than the controls. Multivariate analysis revealed that duodenal location (odds ratio [OR] 3.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-6.65) and use of antithrombotic medications (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.13-5.77) were independent factors for rebleeding. However, there were no differences in clinical outcomes, including final successful endoscopic hemostasis, need for surgical intervention, and mortality between cases and controls. Thromboembolic events did not occur in any cases and controls during the periendoscopic period.
2:::Using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), we collected 90 assessments of real-life PA experiences across 30 days in 18-24 year old individuals with anhedonia (N=69) and without anhedonia (N=69).
3:::Herein, the result indicated that IF remarkably bated cell proliferation in human colorectal cancer cells HT-29 and SW-480 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, IF treatment showed obvious inhibitory activity to cell colony formation in HT-29 and SW-480 cells. Confocal microscopy analysis and flow cytometry detection revealed that IF dramatically induced cell apoptosis in HT-29 and SW-480 cells compared with the control. And IF markedly decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2, whereas the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, including caspase-3, caspase-9 and bax, notably increased in HT-29 and SW-480 cells. Besides, IF blocked Akt pathway via inhibition expression of p-Akt. Furthermore, MK2206, an Akt inhibitor, could inhibit cell colony formation and induced apoptosis. This effect is even more obvious in the presence of MK2206 and IF compared to that of either agent alone.
4:::The proportion of treatment admissions reporting prescription opioid injection and smoking/inhalation abuse increased significantly in the U.S. between 2004 and 2013. Expanding prevention efforts as well as access to medication-assisted treatment and risk reduction services for people who inject drugs is urgently needed.
3:::Analyses showed that (a) SSS was inversely associated with BMI among young adults, (b) objective SES in both adulthood and early life explained about half of this relationship, (c) SSS appeared to offer a partial explanation for the association between SES (in both adulthood and early life) and BMI, (d) health behaviors, psychological characteristics, self-rated health, and perceived stress explained part of the relationship between SSS and BMI after controlling for SES and other covariates, and (e) SSS had a residual association with BMI that was not accounted for by any of the variables in the full model.
2:::We evaluated in vitro if adrenocorticotropic hormone was absorbed in a 2.5 cm plastic tube by measuring adrenocorticotropic hormone 1-24 concentration in a 1 μg/ml adrenocorticotropic hormone aliquot solution before and after being flushed through the plastic tube. For the in vivo study, we recruited 20 healthy adult volunteers. Each subject underwent low-dose test via 2.5 cm plastic tube via plastic tube and via direct intravenous injection by a metal syringe via direct intravenous injection, and cortisol responses were determined.
3:::All patients had physical symptoms for more than 12 weeks before admission. In total, 127 patients responded well to antibacterials. Eighty-seven out of 97 patients who were switched to antifungals had complete response to treatment; patients in the latter group had significantly higher A1C levels at baseline.
2:::Male C57BL/6J mice fed an HFD were orally treated with γ-oryzanol, and striatal levels of molecules involved in D2R signalling were evaluated. The impact of γ-oryzanol on DNA methylation of the D2R promoter and subsequent changes in preferences for dietary fat was examined. In addition, the effects of 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, a potent inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), on food preference, D2R signalling and the levels of DNMTs in the striatum were investigated. The inhibitory effects of γ-oryzanol on the activity of DNMTs were enzymatically evaluated in vitro.'
1:::To assess whether injuries occur more often in an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) where portable EEG amplifiers are used, and where patients can freely move within a large area during the monitoring.
4:::HbA1c did not change 1year after the updated guidelines despite adoption of the new targets. Assessing changes in severe hypoglycemia may require larger, prospective datasets or longer observation.
3:::Of the 368 articles identified in the search, 6 articles met eligibility requirements. Sensitivities ranged from 64 to 97.9% and specificities ranged from 65.6 to 98%. Studies that used multiple field images to detect DR in a younger population generally produced higher quality photos and more valid results.
2:::Fifty freshly extracted mandibular single-rooted premolars were prepared, and LAI was applied to all roots (17% EDTA was 5 mL for 120 seconds with an erbium, chromium:yttrium-scandium-gallium-garnet laser [0.50 W, 20 Hz, 25 mJ]). In addition, 50 quartz fiber posts were randomly assigned to 5 groups (n = 10) according to the surface treatments as follows: group S (sandblasting), group N1 and group N2 (neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser irradiation [2 W, 200 mJ, 10 Hz, with pulse durations of 180 or 320 microseconds), group HF (9.7% hydrofluoric acid etched), and group C (control with no treatment). Dual-cure resin cement was adhered onto the fiber posts after they were covered with a silane agent, and then the posts were placed into the canal space using a Lentulo spiral. The PBS test was performed after all specimens were transversally sectioned (root slices of 1-mm thickness). Data were analyzed with 1-way analysis of variance/Tukey post hoc test (α = 0.05).
3:::TF-XRD showed that both CSE and SU exhibited 10-MDP-Ca nano-layering at the adhesive interface, but with different intensity when reacted with dentin. OX, that contains GPDM, demineralized the dentin surface more severely, forming long resin tags into the dentinal tubules, and gained the highest μTBS at the immediate time-point. Thermo-cycling adversely affected the μTBS and nanoleakage of AEO and OX, but had no significant influence on CSE and SU which contain 10-MDP.
4:::Self-etching adhesives containing different structures/concentrations of functional monomers produced adhesive interfaces with obviously different chemical and morphological characteristics, which may have a direct impact on bonding effectiveness.
2:::Serum DKK-1 and sclerostin levels were measured at primary diagnosis as well as 3-5 days and 12 months after surgery in a cohort of 45 pre- and postmenopausal women with primary estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer treated with adjuvant tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors.
3:::Mean baseline levels ±SD for DKK-1 and sclerostin were 29.7 ± 14.6 and 27.1 ± 16.2 pmol/l, respectively. A significant negative correlation of DKK-1 levels and age was observed (r = -0.32; p < 0.05), but not for sclerostin. Of note, DKK-1 levels were significantly lower in peri- and postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal patients (-47%; p < 0.05). In tamoxifen-treated patients, DKK-1 levels were reduced by 35% (p < 0.01) one year after surgery but remained unaltered in patients treated with aromatase inhibitors. No significant changes were observed for sclerostin.
2:::A single-centre, parallel group, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a 929-bed tertiary referral hospital. Hospital inpatients requiring a peripherally inserted central catheter were randomized to chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) or polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) disc dressing group. Dressings were replaced every seven days, or earlier, if clinically required. Participants were followed until device removal or hospital discharge. Feasibility outcomes included: proportion of potentially eligible participants who were enrolled; proportion of protocol violations; and proportion of patients lost to follow-up. Clinical outcomes were: CLABSI incidence, diagnosed by a blinded infection control practitioner; all-cause bloodstream infection (BSI); and product-related adverse events.
3:::The mean body weight and body mass index (BMI) at baseline and progestin therapy completion was 65.3±16.2 and 66.5±15.9kg (P=0.044), respectively, and 25.51±5.99 and 25.99±5.94kg/m(2) (P=0.034), respectively. During progestin therapy, 51 (33.1%), 29 (18.8%), and 74 patients (48.1%) had weight loss, no weight change, and weight gain, respectively, of which 11 (7.1%) had 10% weight loss and 30 (19.5%) had 10% weight gain. A pretreatment BMI of ≥25kg/m(2) was significantly associated with a lower complete response rate to progestin therapy (P=0.003) and a high recurrence rate (P=0.033). A posttreatment BMI of ≥25kg/m(2) was also a significant factor for high recurrence rate (P=0.049). However, weight change during therapy was not significantly associated with complete response or recurrence rate. Pre and posttreatment BMIs and weight change were not associated with pregnancy and live birth rates.
4:::These analyses suggest that exposure to industrial emissions of air pollutants is related to ACPA positivity.
3:::A total of 872 women underwent randomization in Elaris EM-I and 817 in Elaris EM-II; of these women, 653 (74.9%) and 632 (77.4%), respectively, completed the intervention. At 3 months, a significantly greater proportion of women who received each elagolix dose met the clinical response criteria for the two primary end points than did those who received placebo. In Elaris EM-I, the percentage of women who had a clinical response with respect to dysmenorrhea was 46.4% in the lower-dose elagolix group and 75.8% in the higher-dose elagolix group, as compared with 19.6% in the placebo group; in Elaris EM-II, the corresponding percentages were 43.4% and 72.4%, as compared with 22.7% (P<0.001 for all comparisons). In Elaris EM-I, the percentage of women who had a clinical response with respect to nonmenstrual pelvic pain was 50.4% in the lower-dose elagolix group and 54.5% in the higher-dose elagolix group, as compared with 36.5% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for all comparisons); in Elaris EM-II, the corresponding percentages were 49.8% and 57.8%, as compared with 36.5% (P=0.003 and P<0.001, respectively). The responses with respect to dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain were sustained at 6 months. Women who received elagolix had higher rates of hot flushes (mostly mild or moderate), higher levels of serum lipids, and greater decreases from baseline in bone mineral density than did those who received placebo; there were no adverse endometrial findings.
2:::This was a cohort of consecutively identified Cuban-born adults who developed IBD in the United States and were followed in gastroenterology (GI) clinic. We divided time cohorts of immigration by historical relevance: before 1980, 1980-1994 and 1995-to-present. We examined differences across time cohorts in diagnosis age, time from immigration to IBD diagnosis, and IBD phenotype (ie, IBD type, disease location).
4:::Hepatic impairment does not appear to impact vismodegib PK, and therefore, dose adjustment is not necessary in this special population. The study was influenced by the high number of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with advanced cirrhosis; rendering it difficult to draw any causal relationships between vismodegib exposure and the serious adverse events.
1:::Results of a study comparing the performance of allometric versus consensus guideline-recommended vancomycin dosing in achieving initial trough concentrations within the desired range are reported.
3:::The mean maximum angle of medialization was 20.8°±2.8° (right) and 21.1°±2.8° (left), as measured in the axial CT images. Sagittal CT images show the mean maximum superior angulation was 24.7°±4.3° (right) and 24°±4.0° (left), and the mean minimum superior angulation was 13.6°±4.4° (right) and 13.6°±3.9° (left). The mean screw length within the lateral mass was 21.2±1.9mm (right) and 21.3±2.0mm (left). Given an additional 10-15mm needed for rod adaptation, an ideal screw length of 30-35mm was determined.
2:::In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients aged 20-75 years with ALS of grade 1 or 2 in the Japan ALS Severity Classification, scores of at least 2 points on all 12 items of ALSFRS-R, forced vital capacity of 80% or more, definite or probable ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria, and disease duration of 2 years or less were recruited from 31 hospitals in Japan. Eligible patients also had a decrease of 1-4 points in the ALSFRS-R score during a 12-week observation period before randomisation. Patients meeting all criteria were then randomly assigned 1:1 to receive 60 mg intravenous edaravone or intravenous saline placebo for 6 cycles (4 weeks per cycle with 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off) for a total treatment duration of 24 weeks. In cycle 1, the study drug or placebo was administered once per day for 14 days within a 14 day period, followed by the drug-free period. In cycle 2 and thereafter, the study drug or placebo was administered for 10 days within a 14 day period, followed by a 2 week drug-free period. Participants and investigators, including those assessing outcomes, were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy outcome was the change in ALSFRS-R score from the baseline to 24 weeks (or at discontinuation if this was after the third cycle) after randomisation. The primary outcome was assessed in all patients who had received at least one treatment infusion, had at least one assessment post-baseline, and reached the end of cycle 3. For patients with missing values at the end of cycle 6, data were imputed by the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method, provided the patients had completed at least cycle 3. Safety was assessed in all patients who had received at least one treatment infusion and had at least one assessment post-baseline. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01492686.
3:::Fundus photograph showed a dilated congenital retinal macrovessel with arteriovenous anastomosis, an intravascular white region indicating the thrombus at arteriovenous anastomotic region, and an area of retinal whitening temporal to the fovea. The spectral domain optical coherence tomography images through the area of retinal whitening showed a thickening and highly reflectivity at the level of the inner nuclear layer, which is likely due to the deep capillary ischemia. After 6 weeks, spectral domain optical coherence tomography images through the same area demonstrated a thinning and atrophy of only the inner nuclear layer, and the patients paracentral scotoma persisted.'
4:::RMD individuals are associated with a deficient manipulation for negative material and an unimpaired manipulation for positive material.
2:::70 T1DM patients and 48 healthy volunteers were included. All subjects accepted nerve conduction velocity and CPT examinations for four limbs. Detailed clinical indicators were recorded. CPT values were compared between TIDM group and control group. The risk factors affecting DPN were further explored.
3:::Compared with the control group, CPT values under three frequencies were decreased in T1DM group. The abnormality rate of sural nerves was higher than that of median nerves (P<0.001). Median nerve dysfunction mainly presented as hypoesthesia under 250Hz and 5Hz current stimulus. And sural nerve dysfunction mainly presented as hyperesthesia under three frequencies. Compared with left median nerve, abnormal rate of right median nerve was higher under 2000Hz current stimulus (P=0.035). However, abnormal rate of left sural nerve was higher than that of right side under 250Hz and 5Hz current stimulus (P=0.001, <0.001). Duration, NDS scores and CPT values of right median nerve under 2000Hz current stimulus were independent risk factors of abnormal nerve conduction velocity.
4:::Although the clinical course of UC remains unchanged or even improves in the majority of patients after LT, some may experience an aggressive course. The type of immunosuppression after transplantation can affect UC activity after LT. Cyclosporine may have some protective effects post-LT.
3:::By 2011 to 2015, Whites, African Americans, and Latino/as met both criteria of our operational ""end-of-the-epidemic"" definition. All comparisons that included HIV-HSV-2-coinfected persons had statistically significant higher rates of HIV among racial/ethnic minorities. No comparisons limited to HIV monoinfected persons were significant.
2:::We used a cross-sectional, state-level design to evaluate the effect of state-level firearm legislation on rates of fatal police shootings from January 1, 2015, through October 31, 2016. We measured state-level variation in firearm laws with legislative scorecards from the Brady Center, and for fatal police shootings we used The Counted, an online database maintained by The Guardian.
3:::The annual cumulative incidences of subthreshold depression and anxiety were 21.3% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 18.7-23.9%) and 9.5% (95% CI 7.4-11.6%), respectively. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms were: living alone, having just enough money to cover expenses, having macular degeneration, having problems with adaptation to vision loss, reduced health related quality of life, and experiencing symptoms of anxiety. For developing anxiety symptoms, a relatively younger age, experiencing symptoms of depression, not living alone and experiencing hindrance at work proved to be risk factors.
4:::This study shows that the incidence of subthreshold depression and anxiety in older adults with vision impairment is twice as high compared with older adults in general and confirms that depression and anxiety symptoms fluctuate over time. It is of great importance that low vision rehabilitation staff monitor older adults with vision impairment who are most vulnerable for developing these symptoms, based on the risk factors that were found in this study, to be able to offer early interventions to prevent and treat mental health problems in this population.
2:::Clinical records of 46 LS-SCLC patients with pre-treatment FDG-PET imaging were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were treated with definitive RT for a total dose of 50-60 Gy and chemotherapy. The clinical endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
3:::Participants reported a range of symptoms linked with PCOS, including problems relating to menstruation and weight difficulties. Hirsutism was reported as the most distressing symptom. Emergent themes included perceptions about symptoms and delays in receiving a diagnosis; psychological distress; practical implications of living with the condition; coping with PCOS and perceived support needs. Some findings were specific to cultural backgrounds. Participants were supportive of the idea of group education for women with PCOS and suggested a need to provide education within the community and health care providers.
4:::Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, NT and CRL are independent prognostic factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly PAPP-A and SGA with lower PAPP-A associated with increased risk. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
2:::All emergency surgeries performed in Denmark (2005 to 2011) were analyzed according to time elapsed between previous ischemic stroke and surgery. The risks of 30-day mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events were estimated as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs using adjusted logistic regression models in a priori defined groups (reference was no previous stroke). In patients undergoing surgery immediately (within 1 to 3 days) or early after stroke (within 4 to 14 days), propensity-score matching was performed.
3:::Of 146,694 nonvascular surgeries (composing 98% of all emergency surgeries), 5.3% had previous stroke (mean age, 75 yr [SD = 13]; 53% women, 50% major orthopedic surgery). Antithrombotic treatment and atrial fibrillation were more frequent and general anesthesia less frequent in patients with previous stroke (all P < 0.001). Risks of major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality were high for patients with stroke less than 3 months (20.7 and 16.4% events; OR = 4.71 [95% CI, 4.18 to 5.32] and 1.65 [95% CI, 1.45 to 1.88]), and remained increased for stroke within 3 to 9 months (10.3 and 12.3%; OR = 1.93 [95% CI, 1.55 to 2.40] and 1.20 [95% CI, 0.98 to 1.47]) and stroke more than 9 months (8.8 and 11.7%; OR = 1.62 [95% CI, 1.43 to 1.84] and 1.20 [95% CI, 1.08 to 1.34]) compared with no previous stroke (2.3 and 4.8% events). Major adverse cardiovascular events were significantly lower in 323 patients undergoing immediate surgery (21%) compared with 323 successfully propensity-matched early surgery patients (29%; P = 0.029).
3:::The proportion of patients with complete circumferential osseous extension was 6% (18 of 301 patients). Eighty-nine percent (16 of 18) of the patients had bilateral complete circumferential osseous extension. There were no differences in the proportions of patients with complete circumferential osseous extension among the three groups: 5.3% (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% CI, 0.45-2.31; p = 0.97), 5.3%, and 7.4% (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.28-1.73; p = 0.44) in the dysplasia, normal, and overcoverage groups, respectively, with the numbers available. Eighteen percent (six of 34) of the hips with complete circumferential osseous extension had pain.
4:::Hospital volume did not appear to influence outcomes in patients with TBI. High-volume hospitals may not be necessarily beneficial for patients with TBI exhibiting impaired consciousness as a whole.
2:::We conducted our study on 47 MDR tuberculosis and 14 pan-susceptible strains. We evaluated the ability of Anyplex to detect resistance mutations in rpoB (rifampin [RIF]), katG and inhA (isoniazid [INH]), gyrA (fluoroquinolones [FLQ]), and rrs and eis (aminoglycosides [AMG]). We used the agar proportion method as gold standard. We also studied concordance with GenoType MTBDRplus (first line drugs) and MTBDRsl (second line drugs). DNA sequencing was applied to clarify discrepancies.
3:::In a covariate-adjusted logistic regression model, cognitive decline, female gender, and greater diabetes-related complications were each significantly associated with increased odds of incident depressive symptoms (p < 0.05). In a multiple regression model adjusted for covariates, incident depressive symptoms and older age were associated with greater cognitive decline, and higher education was related to less cognitive decline (p < 0.05).
2:::The pCMV-MIR-143 vector was transfected into MDA-MB-468 cells via JetPEI transfection reagent. The transfected cells were selected by IC50 concentration of Geneticin antibiotic (G418) after a 2-week treatment. To evaluate the effect of miR-143 on the inhibition of migration, scratch wound healing assay was performed. Then, the expression level of miR-143, Kras, Vimentin, CXCR4, MMP9 and E-Cadherin were measured by the qRT-PCR method.
4:::Our results illustrate the high prevalence of combined depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment and that this combination is associated with worse self-care behaviors in older adults with diabetes. These findings highlight the difficulty that some older adults with diabetes may have in maintaining self-care behaviors in the presence of depressed mood and cognitive impairment, particularly in the areas of diet and exercise. The results emphasize the importance of providing more support for these aspects of self-care to such older adults.
1:::The purpose of this study was to develop and implement an interactive situational e-learning system, integrating nursing ethical decisions into a nursing ethics course, and to evaluate the effects of this course on student nurses ethical decision-making competence.'
3:::The percentage of children with overweight/obesity rose with an increasing Parenting Stress Index score. The percentage of children with overweight/obesity in the group of parents with better education and normal mother-child relations was 6.0%, while in the group of less educated parents and pathological mother-child relations, this percentage reached 13.9%. The stratified multivariable model showed that, with reference to the group of better educated parents and normal mother-child relations, lower education level and pathological mother-child relations were statistically significant risk factors for overweight/obesity in 4-6 year-old children, increasing the OR of overweight/obesity (aOR: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.31-4.51). Pathological mother-child relations and maternal smoking mediated the effect of low maternal education level on childrens BMI z-scores.'
2:::Studies that used multiple kinds of ADM products for implant-based breast reconstruction and compared outcomes between them were searched. Outcomes of interest were rates of postoperative complications: infection, seroma, mastectomy flap necrosis, reconstruction failure, and overall complications.
4:::Proton-CSI conferred better treatment outcomes than Photon-CSI for pediatric medulloblastoma patients. This review serves to compare the current literature in the absence of long-term data from prospective studies.
3:::The majority of respondents rated contaminants as a serious health threat, though few of them spontaneously mentioned examples of undesirable substances in foods that fit the scientific or legal definition of contaminants. Mercury and dioxin were the most well-known contaminants. Only a minority of respondents was familiar with pyrrolizidine alkaloids.
2:::Patients with operable TNBC were eligible following definitive breast surgery. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive four cycles of AC followed by either four cycles (12 weeks) of ixabepilone or 12 weekly doses of paclitaxel.
3:::614 patients were randomized: 306 to AC/ixabepilone and 308 to AC/paclitaxel. At a median follow-up of 48 months, 59 patients had relapsed (AC/ixabepilone, 29; AC/paclitaxel, 30). The median time from diagnosis to relapse was 20.8 months. The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates of the two groups were similar [HR 0.92; ixabepilone 87.1% (95% CI 82.6-90.5) vs. paclitaxel 84.7% (95% CI 79.7-88.6)]. The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were also similar [HR 1.1; ixabepilone 89.7% (95% CI 85.5-92.7) vs. paclitaxel 89.6% (95% CI 85.0-92.9)]. Peripheral neuropathy was the most common grade 3/4 event. Dose reductions and treatment discontinuations occurred more frequently during paclitaxel treatment.
3:::significantly attenuated behavioral and biochemical changes associated with diabetic neuropathy. Present study suggested that DAE and CR ameliorated hyperglycemia and diabetic neuropathic pain via modulation of oxidative-nitrosative stress and reduction in AGEs formation in the diabetic rats.
4:::The ACG is a new and effective method for studying functional connectivity of multiple spike trains. This method can identify accurately all the direct connections and can distinguish common source and indirect connections automatically.
2:::Using SEER-Medicare linked data, we identified 444 patients (age≥66years) with node-positive squamous cell vulvar carcinoma, without distant metastases, and treated with primary surgery between 1991 and 2009. We used claims to examine RT use and the following delivery metrics: 1) completion of ≥20 fractions, 2) treatment duration <8weeks, 3) <1week of intra-treatment break, and 4) treatment interval from surgery to start of RT <8weeks. We tested associations between RT use and metrics with overall (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS) using multivariate proportional hazards regression.
3:::Twelve institutions identified 227 patients (220 with complete treatment records) with a mean age of 55 ± 12.5 years. Median time to last follow up was 15 months (interquartile range, 3.8-32). Most patients were men (82% vs 18% women) and symptomatic at presentation (162 vs 65 asymptomatic). Isolated SMA dissection was more common than celiac artery dissection (n = 158 and 81, respectively). Concomitant dissection of both arteries was rare (n = 12). The mean dissection length was significantly longer in symptomatic patients than in asymptomatic patients in both the celiac artery (27 vs 18 mm; P = .01) and the SMA (64 vs 40 mm; P < .001). Primary treatment was medical in 146 patients with oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy (n = 76 and 70, respectively), whereas 56 patients were observed. LVT occurred in six patients, and 16 patients developed AD (3% and 8%, respectively). For symptomatic patients without evidence of ischemia (n = 134), there was no difference in occurrence of LVT with medical therapy compared with observation alone (9% vs 0%; P = .35). No asymptomatic patient (n = 64) had an episode of LVT at 5 years. AD rates did not differ among symptomatic patients without ischemia treated with medical therapy or observed (9% vs 5%; P = .95). Surgical or endovascular intervention was performed in 18 patients (3 ischemia, 13 pain, 1 AD, 1 asymptomatic). Excluding the patients treated for ischemia, there was no difference in LVT with surgical intervention vs medical management (one vs five; P = .57).
4:::Although the DENV NS1 antigen assay was highly specific in this cohort of laboratory confirmed ZIKV-infected travelers, we demonstrate high percentages of cross-reactivity of DENV IgM and IgG ELISÁs of which diagnostic laboratories should be aware. In addition, the high rate of DENV IgG background of >25% complicates a proper serological diagnosis in this group.
3:::120 patients (male 52.5%), aged 69±16years were enrolled. Ten patients on warfarin treatment had significantly lower ETP than the others. Among the remaining, ETP in the presence or absence of TM did not differ according to TOAST classification aetiology (large vessel vs. cardioembolic vs. lacunar vs. others). In PRP, ETP was similar in patients with ICAD and in those without (1748±160 vs. 1851±36nM·min, p=0.393), whereas, ETP measured in presence of thrombomodulin was higher in patients with than in those without ICAD (2045±99 vs. 1715±41nM·min, p=0.011). In PPP, ETP was similar in patients with ICAD and in those without, whereas thrombin peak was higher in patients with ICAD than in those without both in the presence (165±17 vs. 130±5nM, p=0.036) and in the absence of TM (178±19 vs. 142±5nM, p=0.037).
2:::In-depth interviews with 96 trainers at 9 public universities and 17 regional health science colleges across Ethiopia were conducted to elicit their opinions about available resources, program curriculum suitability, and competence of graduating students. Using Dedoose, data were thematically analyzed using grounded theory.
3:::Of the 4594 infants included in the cohort, 2496 infants (54.3%) were boys, and the mean (SD) gestational age was 28.5 (2.2) weeks and mean (SD) birth weight was 1213 (400) g. Mortality for the 662 infants (14.4%) unexposed to ANS was 20.6% (136 of 661). Administration of ANS was associated with an immediate and rapid decline in mortality, reaching a plateau with more than 50% risk reduction after an administration-to-birth interval of 18 to 36 hours. A similar pattern for timing was seen for the composite mortality or morbidity outcome, whereas a significant risk reduction of severe neonatal brain injury was associated with longer administration-to-birth intervals (greater than 48 hours). For all outcomes, the risk reduction associated with ANS was transient, with increasing mortality and risk for severe neonatal brain injury associated with administration-to-birth intervals exceeding 1 week. Under the assumption of a causal relationship between timing of ANS and mortality, a simulation of ANS administered 3 hours before delivery to infants who did not receive ANS showed that their estimated decline in mortality would be 26%.
3:::Sixty-seven MRI centers completed the survey (55% response rate). Sixteen centers (24%) did not specifically screen for endoscopic clips, five because they were not aware that endoscopic clips may not be safe for MRI. Fifty-one centers (76%) did screen for endoscopic clips. At least 23% of screeners misclassified the safety of one or more MRI-unsafe clips. As many as 36% of screeners may perform MRI on patients with confirmed gastrointestinal endoscopic clips; 16% reschedule for more than 6 weeks after endoscopy; and 18% limit the field strength to 1.5 T, the safety of which is uncertain.
4:::Continual refinement with LDN techniques based on intraoperative observations and technological advances is necessary to keep complication rates low and reduce donor morbidity and time for recovery.
2:::This was a retrospective study conducted in all the patients aged ≤18 years who underwent pediatric open-heart surgery in the year 2015. Clinical data were retrieved from the institutional database for cardiac surgery patients. Data on swab cultures were retrieved from the laboratory database. Swab colonization was tested for association with infection and other outcomes.
3:::The prevalence of hyperglycemia in internal medicine was 45.7% (886 out of 1939). A total of 741 (83.6%) patients were treated by non-endocrinology departments; of those, 230 (31.1%) were in poor glycemic control and needed an endocrinology consultation. Yet only 57 (24.8%) received one. In 4 cases, the physician did not follow the consultants advice. Among the remaining 53 consulted patients, 35 (66.1%) were still in poor glycemic control, yet only about half received a second consultation. Finally, among patients treated in non-endocrinology departments, 58 (7.8%) had hypoglycemia; less than half retested their blood glucose after treatment.'
2:::A total of 386 children aged 6-17 years were enrolled in the baseline investigation of the Beijing Myopia Progression Study in 2010. They were invited for follow-up vision examinations in the years 2011, 2012, and 2013, including cycloplegic (cyclopentolate 1%, three times) autorefraction. We investigated the difference between the cycloplegic spherical equivalent (SE) and the non-cycloplegic SE (DSE) provided by autorefraction and its association with refractive error progression. The progression of refractive error was defined as the difference between the cycloplegic SE at follow-up and at baseline.
4:::The tissue fixation system midurethral sling operation is a simple, safe and effective operation for older women with intrinsic sphincter deficiency, and it can be carried out under local anesthesia.
1:::Although breast cancer in young women accounts for <10% of diagnoses annually, tumors in young patients exhibit more aggressive characteristics and higher mortality rates. Determination of the frequency of germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes is needed to improve the understanding of breast cancer etiology in young women.
3:::Subjects in the highest quartile of DII scores (i.e., with the most pro-inflammatory diets) had a higher risk of NHL compared with subjects in the lowest quartile (i.e., with the most anti-inflammatory diets) (ORQuartile4vs1 1.61, 95% confidence interval CI 1.07-2.43; p-trend = 0.01). Stratified analyses produced stronger associations between DII and NHL among males (ORQuartile4vs1 2.14; 95% CI 1.25-3.67) with significant heterogeneity (p value = 0.02); when analyzed by histologic subtype, a significant association was observed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ORQuartile4vs1 1.84; 95% CI 1.09-3.10).
3:::In total 799 patients from 6 centers were included in the study. There were 67 patients (8.3%) with positive acute findings on head CT scan. All of these patients (100%) had at least one criteria positive. There were 732 patients who had negative acute findings on head CT scan with 376 patients (51%) having at least one criteria positive and 356 patients (49%) having no criteria positive. Sensitivity of 100% and negative predictive value of 100% was observed to predict negative acute findings on head CT scan when all the three criteria were negative.
2:::Electronic databases were searched through 1 May 2016 for literature on acellular dermal matrix use in laryngotracheal and pharyngeal reconstruction. Studies were appraised for surgical indications, outcomes and study design.
3:::In 2014, overall clozapine use prevalence was greatest in Finland (189.2/100 000 persons) and in New Zealand (116.3/100 000), and lowest in the Japanese cohort (0.6/100 000), and in the privately insured US cohort (14.0/100 000). From 2005 to 2014, clozapine use increased in almost all studied countries (relative increase: 7.8-197.2%). In most countries, clozapine use was highest in 40-59-year-olds (range: 0.6/100 000 (Japan) to 344.8/100 000 (Finland)). In youths (10-19 years), clozapine use was highest in Finland (24.7/100 000) and in the publicly insured US cohort (15.5/100 000).
4:::Our findings suggested, for the first time, the participation of LOX enzymes and products in the signaling pathway leading to CPT-associated nephrotoxicity, which could be the foundation stone for combining LOX pathway attenuators with CPT therapy to decrease CPT-associated renal toxicity.
2:::Wistar rats were divided into Sham, CLP, Sham+CoQ10, CLP+CoQ10 subgroups. CoQ10 (10mg/kg/day) or vehicle (olive oil; 1mL/kg/day) was intraperitoneally injected for 15days. At 16th day, Sham or CLP operation was performed. 20h after the operations, MABF and phenylephrine responses of isolated aortic rings were measured. Tissue samples were obtained for histopathological and biochemical evaluations. Furthermore, survival rates were monitored throughout 96h.
3:::At least 70% of the Canadian population has QEEG access through academic medical institutions with applicability to adults and children. QEEG was clinically used 50% in real-time and 50% retrospectively in the critical care and epilepsy monitoring units for long-term monitoring and automated seizure detection. QEEG trend use, montage use, and duration were variable.
3:::582,171 patients met the criteria for inclusion. 53.0% of them were women with an average age of 64.3 years (SD 10.8years). 53.2% were pensioners. 49% of the included population had an ND, with an average of 2.1ND per patient. The average costs per patient were 1824.62€ (with a median of 827.5€) 25 and 27 percentiles of 264.1€ and 1824.7€, respectively. The bivariate analysis showed a significant correlation between these expenses and all the demographic variables; the expenses increased when a nursing diagnosis has been made (Spearmans rank=0.37: the more diagnoses, the more expenses). In the multivariate analysis, a first linear regression with the sociodemographic variables as independent variables explains 13.7% of the variability of the logarithm of the full costs (R(2)=0.137). If we add to this model the presence of nursing diagnoses, the explanatory capacity reaches 19.77% (R(2)=0.1977).'
2:::Twenty patients treated for established or congenital unilateral facial palsy reanimated with gracilis muscle transplant reinnervated with masseteric nerve were retrospectively analyzed. The FDI questionnaire on quality of life was administered before and after surgery and statistical analysis of results was conducted to score changes.
4:::These results reinforce that a negative PCR could be a useful tool to support prophylaxis interruption among patients with CD4 counts above 200cells/mm(3) and that a positive PCR suggests imminent VL relapse.
3:::We included articles published between January 1, 1991 and February 29, 2016, where language was not limited. Of the 9 identified articles, the prevalence of ARD ranged from 1.19/1000 in multiday admission patients residing in the United Kingdom to 25.6% in elderly clinic alcoholics from the United States. The proportion of ARD in early-onset dementia taken from 3 studies was approximately 10%, whereas only 1.28% in late-onset dementia taken from 1 study.
2:::We first analyzed whether admitted patients were discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of TIA. We then analyzed whether admission was associated with a composite outcome (new stroke, new myocardial infarction, or death in the year after TIA) using multivariate logistic regression modeling with propensity score matching.
4:::VCDs ability like VPA to reduce rat brain AA turnover and inhibit recombinant Acsl-4, and its efficacy in BD, suggest that VCD be further considered as a non-teratogenic VPA substitute for treating BD.'
3:::Of the 4062 patients with DRTLE, 3.6%(n=148) underwent lobectomy. Overall, the mean age of the cohort was 42.35±16.33years, and 54% were female. Regression models adjusted for patient demographics, clinical and hospital characteristics demonstrated no racial disparities in access to surgical care for DRTLE. Likewise, no racial disparity was noted in outcomes in the surgical cohort.
1:::To characterize the dependence of normalized glandular dose (DgN) on various breast model and image acquisition parameters during spot compression mammography and other partial breast irradiation conditions, and evaluate alternative previously proposed dose-related metrics for this breast imaging modality.
2:::This study assessed the association between adolescent obesity and future risk for MPN. Data on 2,516,256 Israeli adolescents, who underwent a compulsory general health examination at ages 16 to 19, between 1967 and 2011, were linked to the National Cancer Registry in this nationwide, population-based cohort study. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for MPN associated with BMI measured at adolescence.
3:::Eighty three consecutive MOH patients were enrolled. Fifty seven patients completed the study protocol. Nineteen patients were randomized to each group. Withdrawal headache on the 5th day was absent in 21.0% of group A, in 31.6% of group B and in 12.5% of group C without significant differences. Withdrawal headache intensity decreased significantly after withdrawal without differences among the groups. Rregardless of withdrawal treatment, 52% MOH patients reverted to an episodic migraine and 62% had no more medication overuse after 3 months.
4:::Treating oncologists must distinguish platform differences from true biological heterogeneity when comparing tumor and cfDNA genomic testing results. Tumor and concurrent cfDNA contribute unique genomic information in metastatic breast cancer patients, providing potentially useful biomarkers for aggressive metastatic disease.
3:::The DISCOVER program will record patient, healthcare provider, and healthcare system characteristics, treatment patterns, and factors influencing changes in therapy. In addition, disease control (e.g. achievement of glycated hemoglobin target), management of associated risk factors (e.g. hypercholesterolemia and hypertension), and healthcare resource utilization will be recorded. Microvascular and macrovascular complications, incidence of hypoglycemic events, and patient-reported outcomes will also be captured.
2:::A total of 28 FES patients and 33 healthy controls (HCs) underwent NIRS while performing a VFT. Six regions of interests (ROIs) were defined: the bilateral frontal-, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and temporal regions. Laterality index (LI) was calculated and compared between the two groups in ROIs. In addition, we investigated whether language lateralization was correlated with severity of clinical symptoms.
3:::Associations (sometimes non-linear) were observed between HI and each health outcome. For example, a day with a HI of 95°F vs. 75°F was associated with a cumulative 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.5%, 8.5%) and 5.1% (95% CI: 0.2%, 10.3%) higher rate of all-cause ED visits and deaths, respectively, with some evidence of regional heterogeneity. We estimate that in the study area, days with a HI≥95°F were associated with an annual average of 784 (95% CI: 658, 908) excess ED visits and 22 (95% CI: 3, 39) excess deaths.
4:::Our results suggest the presence of adverse health impacts associated with HI below the current local guideline criteria of HI≥100°F used to issue heat advisories. We hypothesize that lowering this threshold may lead to substantially reduced heat-related morbidity and mortality in the study area.
2:::40 male Sprague-Dawley rats with an average weight of 180-220g were equally distributed into five groups. The normal control group was injected with normal saline (.9% NACL), the CFA group with CFA, AL(OH)3 group was given AL(OH)3 injection, T2 group using a novel peptide T2 and T2+AL(OH)3+CFA group was injected with T2+AL(OH)3+CFA. Dosing to all rat groups were injected subcutaneously. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and Immunohistochemistry were used to investigate inflammatory cell infiltration and IL-1β in the prostate tissue respectively. ELISA technique was used to measure the serum level of CRP and TNF-α. T-test was used to analyze the results.
3:::Women with low 2D:4D reported significantly more pain 1h after an operation than women with high 2D:4D. Similar correlation was observed for low 2D:4D in women 48h AO. In men, low 2D:4D was associated with lower postoperative pain 12h AO (p=0.029).
3:::From pregnant IBD women and pregnant controls, 174 and 21 fecal samples were collected, respectively. The median FC concentration in pregnant IBD women was 131 μg/g (range 0-3600) and in controls 0 μg/g (range 0-84) (P < 0.0001). FC strongly correlated with PGA at all 5 timepoints (r ≥ 0.80; P < 0.0001) and with HBI/SCCAI before (r = 0.66; P < 0.0001) and after pregnancy (r = 0.47; P < 0.003) but not during pregnancy (P > 0.05). An FC cutoff concentration of 250 μg/g significantly correlated with active disease according to PGA in all 5 periods (P ≤ 0.0002). CRP only significantly correlated with FC (P = 0.0007) and PGA in the second trimester (P = 0.0003). No significant correlation was found between CRP and HBI/SCCAI at any timepoint (P > 0.05).
4:::The physiological changes that occur during pregnancy do not affect FC, in contrast to CRP and HBI/SCCAI. The combined use of FC and PGA seems optimal to assess disease activity in IBD during pregnancy.
2:::A total of 34 patients who underwent surgical treatment for middle ear cholesteatoma were recruited in the study. The mRNA and protein expression of HB-EGF in middle ear cholesteatoma tissues and normal postauricular skin tissues was investigated by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), immunohistochemical staining, and western blot. The correlation between bone resorption degree and HB-EGF expression was also analyzed.
1:::The prevalence of allergic diseases is known to be associated with both demographic and environmental factors. Herein, we aimed to determine significant factors associated with the prevalence of allergic diseases and with total immunoglobulin E (tIgE) and specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) levels in Korea.
3:::One hundred patients were enrolled. The frequency of hypophosphatemia (Pi ≤ 0.65 mmol/l) was 70%. Chronic hypertension, acute hydrocephalus, and diffuse brain edema were more common in patients with hypophosphatemia compared with normophosphatemics (44% vs. 21%, P = 0.021; 59% vs. 33%, P = 0.021; and 43% vs. 13%, P = 0.004, respectively). Hypophosphatemic patients had higher maximum SOFA scores [10 (7-11) vs. 7.5 (5.75-10), P = 0.024]. Initial phosphate concentration correlated inversely with APACHE II score on admission (ρ = -0.304, P = 0.002) and SOFA score on the first ICU day (ρ = -0.269, P = 0.008). There was no difference in outcome between hypophosphatemic and normophosphatemic patients. In all five patients with severe hypophosphatemia (Pi < 0.32 mmol/l) the functional outcome was good.
4:::The study provides evidence that p-EVES devices can play a useful role in supplementing the range of low vision aids used to reduce activity limitation for near vision tasks.
2:::Pregnant mice were randomly divided into four groups on gestational day 14 (GD 14). Mice in the Control × 1 group were exposed to 100% oxygen for 150 min. Mice in the Sevo × 1 group were also exposed to 100% oxygen for 150 min, except that 2.5% sevoflurane was added during the first 120 min. Mice in the Control × 3 and Sevo × 3 group were identically treated as Control × 1 and Sevo × 1 group for three consecutive days, respectively (GD 14-16). Behavioral tests were performed only with the male offspring at the age of 2-4 months. Synaptic plasticity was also compared by inducing long-term potentiation in acute hippocampal slices.
3:::Death due to VF occurred in 12% of pigs treated with metformin compared with 50% of untreated controls (p = 0.03). The anti-fibrillatory effect of metformin was associated with attenuation of action potential shortening in ischaemic myocardium (p = 0.02) and attenuation of the difference in action potential duration between ischaemic and non-ischaemic regions (p < 0.001) compared with untreated controls. Metformin had no effect on myocardial contractile function, oxygen consumption, or glucose or lactate utilisation. During ischaemia, however, metformin treatment amplified the activation of AMPK and preserved ATP concentration in myocardium compared with untreated controls (each p < 0.05).
2:::A retrospective cohort study design was used. Clinical and laboratory data for 30 patients undergoing biologic therapy who were seropositive for HBV or HCV were evaluated. Next, a systematic review was performed. Primary outcomes were hepatitis and viral reactivation during therapy. Treatment duration and antiviral prophylaxis were also recorded.
3:::The results indicated that, compared to normal lighting conditions, participants sleepiness and melatonin rhythm significantly declined when they were exposed to blue-enriched white light. Furthermore, the experimental condition had a significant effect on the reduction of working memory errors. It also decreased omission errors and the reaction time during the sustained attention task.'
4:::Cone-beam CT has a significantly higher diagnostic performance compared with preprocedural multidetector CT in the detection of HCCs and can influence management of patients with cirrhosis by identifying particularly aggressive tumors.
3:::Four hundred and fifty-four patients underwent multigene panel screening, including 138 Ashkenazi Jewish patients. The median patient age was fifty-two years. Three hundred and fifty-four patients (78%) had a personal history of cancer. Two hundred and fifty-one patients had breast cancer, 49, ovarian cancer, 26, uterine cancer and 20, colorectal cancer. We identified 62 mutations in 56 patients and 291 variants of uncertain significance in 196 patients. Among the 56 patients with mutations, 51 (91%) had actionable mutations. Twenty mutations were identified by multigene panels among Ashkenazi Jewish patients, 18 of which were in genes other than BRCA1/2. A review of targeted BRCA1/2 testing performed over the same study period included 103 patients and identified six mutations in BRCA1/2, all of which occurred in Ashkenazi Jewish patients. Among all Ashkenazi Jewish patients undergoing genetic testing, 25/183 (14%) had a mutation, 24/25 of which were actionable (96%) and 17/25 patients (68%) had mutations in non BRCA1/2 genes.
2:::117 serum samples were analyzed for MPO and PR3 autoantibodies. The INOVA QUANTA Lite® IgG assay (INOVA Diagnostics) were performed at two facilities and the Bio-Plex® 2200 Vasculitis Panel (Bio-Rad) were performed at a third reference lab. The results were compared both qualitatively (between INOVA QUANTA Lite® and Bio-Plex® methods) and quantitatively (between two sites performing INOVA QUANTA Lite® assays).
4:::Compared with other techniques, presurgical hand hygiene with hydroalcoholic solution significantly decreases CFU, has similar latency time, a lower cost, and saves time.
3:::The mean annual dose of RLAI was 638.41mg, which was equal to an average dose of 24.6mg every 2 weeks. The prevalence of concomitant use of conventional antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics, lithium, and antidepressants decreased from the pre-RLAI period to the post-RLAI period by 23.75%, 31.91%, 1.29%, and 7.08%, respectively. RLAI use decreased emergency room (ER) visits, hospital admissions, length of hospital stay, and non-medication costs (all P<0.0001). The cost savings with RLAI were attributed to lower hospitalization costs in spite of higher medication costs. Moreover, rapid cycling patients (n=36) demonstrated greater reduction in ER and inpatient services with RLAI than non-rapid cycling patients (n=251).
2:::A randomized controlled efficacy study of three 6-month weight loss treatments was conducted in 96 adults with obesity: 1) self-guided (SELF), 2) standard (STND), or 3) technology-supported (TECH). STND and TECH received eight in-person group treatment sessions. SELF and STND used paper diaries to self-monitor diet, activity, and weight; TECH used a smartphone application with social networking features and wireless accelerometer.
4:::Findings illustrate the potential power of genome-wide PRSs to advance understanding of the relationship between PTSD and DMN connectivity, a putative neural endophenotype of the disorder.
3:::Among 183 participants, 106 (57.9%) were diagnosed with MetS. Components of MetS included hypertension (n=144, 78.7%), hyperglycemia (n=135, 73.8%), hypertriglyceridemia (n=125, 68.3%), abdominal obesity (n=123, 67.2%), and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (n=121, 66.1%). Although daily energy expenditure was similar among the women with or without MetS, total energy intake was increased in the group with MetS (P<0.001). The following measures were also increased among women with MetS: saturated fatty acid intake (P<0.001), C-reactive protein (P=0.051), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (P<0.001), and carbonyls (P<0.001). By contrast, decreased monounsaturated fatty acid intake (P=0.024) and catalase activity (P<0.001) were observed in this group.
1:::Avoiding measurement variability from (18) F phantom preparation by using (68) Ge/(68) Ga phantoms for the determination of (18) F recovery curves (RC) in clinical quality assurance measurements and for PET/CT site qualification in multicentre clinical trials.
2:::We performed a structured comprehensive review of controlled clinical trials and summaries of individual product characteristics to assess study and total patient numbers, quality of major outcome data and data of geriatric relevance. The resulting evidence was discussed in a round table with an interdisciplinary panel of ten European experts. Decisions on age appropriateness were made using a Delphi process.
3:::Twelve randomized trials with data for the primary outcome were identified. Data were available for meta-analysis for two comparisons. Wounds managed with film dressings (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.57) or with hydrofiber dressings (odds ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20-0.40) were significantly less likely to have wound complications than those managed with passive dressings. There was no evidence that any dressing significantly reduced surgical-site infection rates compared with any other dressing. Hydrofibre dressings showed better fluid handling capacity than passive dressings in terms of mean number of dressing changes (mean difference 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-2.57) and number of patients requiring early dressing change (odds ratio, 8.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.68-15.83).
3:::Compared with the numeric only format, both the spinner and icon array increased risk knowledge and were rated more likeable by subjects. Subjects viewing the spinner format were also more likely to prefer the pill with the lowest side-effect burden.
4:::FLAPS is a new technique, in which the preparation of an ultrathin CAG is done by the FSL. After optimization in porcine eyes, the clinical trial in the first 6 eyes was performed without any complications and the FSL might assist in further standardizing the surgical procedure. Longer follow-up and larger cohorts are needed to assess recurrence rates.
2:::We intended to perform a 1-day MPI within 140 min and simulate radioactivities in the second scan under various injected dose ratios. To apply this, a cardiac phantom was scanned with various radioactivities and scans were compared with a reference scan with the ideal tracer concentrations.
3:::The transfer of the method showed that the Orbitrap system provides the same accurate analytical results compared with the LC/MS/MS method except for 4-epitetracycline, anhydroerythromycin A, erythromycin A enol ether, and dihydrostreptomycin. Furthermore, the LC/LTQ-Orbitrap system is capable of successfully competing with the LC/MS/MS method by additional provision of high mass resolution and mass accuracy even though it shows less sensitivity compared with the LC/MS/MS instrument. CCα levels for most analytes were 1.3 times higher by LC/MS/MS than those observed by LC/LTQ-Orbitrap. The method was assessed in terms of relative bias through analysis of a reference material provided by FAPAS (Food Analysis Performance and Assessment Scheme) and also through the control of several contaminated honey samples from local Lebanese markets. Satisfactory relative bias was below 22% except for tetracycline found in one sample that showed a higher bias at 29%.
1:::The purpose of the study was to assess the value of initial sonography in the diagnosis of right-sided colonic diverticulitis in comparison with supplementary CT.
2:::Using a publicly accessed RNA-seq dataset including 1087 breast cancer patients, we performed Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate Cox regression models to evaluate the associations of CTLA4, PD-1, and weighted T cell activation score with patients overall survival.'
4:::T cell activation score has significantly positive relationship with patients overall survival, and may serve as a marker of personalized immunotherapy in breast cancer patients. Cocktail rather than single immune checkpoint blockade may yield more benefit for breast cancer patients.'
3:::From 433 studies, 15 new studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed together with five studies from the 2012 review. These included 13 cross-sectional surveys, five cohort studies (using baseline data), and two using baseline clinical trial data. Most (19 of 20) were from the United States. In total, 12,324 patients were studied (3529 nondialysis CKD, 5289 dialysis, 2560 transplant, and 946 with unspecified CKD; median =198.5; IQR, 128.5-260 per study). Median prevalence of limited health literacy within studies was 23% (IQR, 16%-33%), and pooled prevalence was 25% (95% confidence interval, 20% to 30%) with significant between-study heterogeneity (I(2)=97%). Pooled prevalence of limited health literacy was 25% (95% confidence interval, 16% to 33%; I(2)=97%) among patients with CKD not on dialysis, 27% (95% confidence interval, 19% to 35%; I(2)=96%) among patients on dialysis, and 14% (95% confidence interval, 7% to 21%; I(2)=97%) among patients with transplants. A higher proportion of nonwhite participants was associated with increased limited health literacy prevalence (P=0.04), but participant age was not (P=0.40). Within studies, nonwhite ethnicity and low socioeconomic status were consistently and independently associated with limited health literacy. Studies were of low or moderate quality. Within-study participant selection criteria had potential to introduce bias.
3:::The Dysexecutive/Mixed group demonstrated the fastest rate of decline across all groups. Amnestic and Dysnomic groups showed steeper rates of decline than CDNs. While CDNs had more functional difficulty than NCs across visits, both groups mean FAQ scores remained below its suggested cutoff at all visits.'
4:::Results (a) show the importance of executive dysfunction in the context of other impaired cognitive domains when predicting functional decline in at-risk elders, and (b) support our previous work demonstrating that ADNIs MCI criteria may have resulted in false-positive MCI diagnoses, given the CDN's better FAQ trajectory than those of the cognitively impaired MCI groups. (JINS, 2017, 23, 521-527).'
2:::A literature search was performed on Premna species based on books of herbal medicine, major scientific databases including Chemical Abstract, Pubmed, SciFinder, Springerlink, Science Direct, Scopus, the Web of Science, Google Scholar, and ethnobotanical databases.
3:::Seventy-one (71) LCS and 39 ZNS patients were identified. Average age at LCS initiation was 71.0±7.0 years and 49% were medically refractory. Average duration of follow up was 23.1±21.2 months. At last follow up, the retention rate was 60% and seizure freedom rate 52%. Of the 19 discontinuations due to side effects, 7 (37%) were due to dizziness/gait instability. No predictors of discontinuation were identified. Average age at ZNS initiation was 69.7±6.9 years and 51% were medically refractory. Average duration of follow up was 46.3±38.3 months. At last follow up, the retention rate was 64% and seizure freedom rate was 67%. Of the 12 discontinuations due to side effects, 4 (33%) were due to cognitive or behavioral side effects. Predictors of discontinuation included a lower starting dose.
2:::The present prospective cross-sectional study enrolled attending physicians and fellows specializing in gynecologic oncology from the USA during December 2012 and January 2013. A 33-question survey collecting demographic data and details of participant opinions on existing practices was distributed to potential respondents. Survey responses were aggregated and descriptive analyses were performed.
3:::We analyzed 20 samples of ascitic fluid from the patients of cardiac cirrhosis and compared with 48 samples of non-cirrhotic cardiac ascites. The AFP was significantly lower in patients with cardiac cirrhosis (3.66g/dl) as compared to non-cirrhotic patients (4.31g/dl, p < .01); while there was no difference in serum-ascites albumin gradient (1.48g/dl vs. 1.47g/dl, p = .95). AFP equal to or less than 4.3g/dl predicted cirrhosis with a sensitivity of 95% and negative likelihood ratio of 0.10; the corresponding ROC curve of AFP has an AUC of 0.777, higher than AUC of other noninvasive prediction models.
1:::Pharmaceutical companies paid at least $3.91bn to prescribers in 2013, yet evidence indicating whether industry payments shift prescribing away from generics is limited. This study examined the association between amount of industry payments to prescribers and generic drug prescribing rates among Medicare Part D prescribers.
4:::Receipt of industry payments was associated with a decreased rate of generic drug prescribing. How this affects patient care and total medical costs warrants further study. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
2:::A sample of 677 PLHIV representing key affected populations (KAP) in Nepal, who were undergoing antiretroviral (ART) therapy in ART clinics around the country, were voluntarily enrolled in the study. Rapid kit-based testing followed by ELISA for validation was performed, focusing on HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies against HCV (anti-HCV). A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with HBV and HCV co-infection.
3:::HCV and HBV co-infection among the 677 PLHIV was found to be 19% (95% confidence interval (CI) 16.6-22.7%) and 4.4% (95% CI 3.1-6.6%), respectively. The Eastern Region had the highest percentage of HCV infection (48%). The age group with the highest rates of co-infection was 30-39 years (58% and 70%, respectively, for HCV and HBV co-infection). After adjusting for confounding, males were more likely to have HBV co-infection than females (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.61, 95% CI 1.42-14.98). Similarly, PLHIV who were male (AOR 5.7, 95% CI 2.06-15.98), had a secondary level of education (AOR 3.04, 95% CI 1.06-8.70), or who were drug users (AOR 28.7, 95% CI 14.9-55.22) were significantly more likely to have HCV co-infection.
4:::Knowledge of Kommerells diverticulum presence and morphology as well as the LASA course during preinterventional work-up of patients with congenital heart defects is critical, since it may have surgical implications during corrective procedures.'
3:::Supraomohyoid neck dissection (SOHND) was the most common procedure. Neck failure developed in 4 pathologic negative (pN[-]) and 3 pathologic positive (pN[+]) patients. The site of neck recurrence was beyond the dissected field in all cases. The site of recurrence in pN(-) patients was ipsilateral in 2 patients and contralateral in 2, whereas the site in pN(+) patients was ipsilateral in 1 patient and contralateral in 2.
2:::Forty-three teeth with posttreatment apical periodontitis were selected for retreatment. Teeth were randomly divided into 2 groups according to the irrigant used (2.5% sodium hypochlorite [NaOCl], n = 22; saline, n = 21). Canals were prepared with the Twisted File Adaptive (TFA) system (SybronEndo, Orange, CA). Bacteriological samples were taken before preparation (S1), after using the first instrument (S2), and then after the third instrument of the TFA system (S3). In the saline group, an additional sample was taken after final irrigation with 1% NaOCl (S4). DNA was extracted from the clinical samples and subjected to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to evaluate the levels of total bacteria and streptococci.
3:::ENT knowledge was generally thought to be poor amongst doctors, and it was recommended that undergraduate ENT topics be kept simple. The highest rated topics were: clinical examination; when to refer; acute otitis media; common emergencies; tonsillitis and quinsy; management of ENT problems by non-ENT doctors; stridor and stertor; otitis externa; and otitis media with effusion.
4:::E-health interventions are a very successful way to increase PA. More research is required to look at what theoretical principles are best to underpin interventions and also to assess the length of intervention required for optimal results after intervention. Ideas surrounding implementation and the mediums used require more studies to evidence base these interventions for schools, colleges and university via intracurriculum or extracurriculum.
2:::Women of reproductive age in three selected lower districts in Bahir Dar, North-West Ethiopia, were included. Multi-stage simple random sampling and simple random sampling were used to select the districts and respondents, respectively. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire comprising questions related to knowledge and attitude toward legal status of abortion and cases where abortion is currently allowed by law in Ethiopia. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data and multivariable logistic regression computed to assess the magnitude and significance of associations.
3:::High-HYP individuals exhibited an asymmetric belief revision for positive events, reflected by an exaggerated incorporation of better-than-expected and an impaired integration of worse-than-expected information, relative to their low-HYP control counterparts. The strength of this optimistic update bias was linked to the trait sensitivity of the behavioral approach system. Furthermore, high-HYP individuals demonstrated a more optimistic initial prediction bias, characterized by greater overestimations of their likelihood to experience positive events, and reported enhanced trait optimism.
1:::Patients perceptions of the effectiveness of a treatment, or perceived treatment effectiveness (PTE), play an important role in medicine. This study aimed to evaluate patients' PTE in dry eye disease (DED) and investigate factors contributing to these patients' perceptions.'
2:::Cases experienced late HIV failure, defined as plasma HIV RNA >1000 copies/mL after maintaining viral suppression (<400 copies/mL) for at least 6 months. For each case, a total of 4 control patients were randomly sampled from the same population. Controls had plasma HIV RNA <400 copies/mL on ART for at least 6 months. Logistic regression was used to determine the adjusted odds of late HIV failure by 516G>T genotype.
3:::Participants were primarily black (79%); 16% were Hispanic; 55% were female. Mean memory and EF scores at follow-up generally fell in the low-average to average range. Pairwise comparison of adjusted mean change from baseline to follow-up revealed significantly greater change for PHIV/non-C compared with PHEU youth in only one verbal recognition task, with a difference in mean changes for PHIV/non-C versus PHEU of -0.99 (95% CI: -1.80 to -0.19; P = 0.02). Among youth with PHIV, better immunologic status at baseline was positively associated with follow-up measures of verbal recall and recognition and cognitive inhibition/flexibility. Past AIDS-defining diagnoses and higher peak viral load were associated with lower performance across multiple EF tasks at follow-up.
4:::Addressing the end-of-the-month increase in hypoglycemia risk among lower-income populations may avert substantial costs from emergency department visits and inpatient hospitalizations.
3:::A total of 5850 Peruvian infants were evaluated in 2013. Mean age was 13 ± 6.6 months, 50.7% were male and mean maternal education was 6.6 ± 4.0 years; 34.8% infants were stunted, 7.8% were underweight, 0.9% were wasted and 2% had age adjusted greater than 35 days for prematurity for ASQ-3 interval assignment. Mean total ASQ-3 was 42.2 ± 8.2. The ASQ-3 allocated 49.6% with suspected delay in one or more developmental areas. Before and after adjusting for wealth quintile, maternal education level, infant nutritional status and prematurity adjustment, age subgroup remained significantly associated with total ASQ-3 score (β = 1.8, CI: 1.7-2.0, P < 0.001), sectional ASQ-3 score (all P < 0.001) and inversely associated with one or more scores indicating suspected developmental delay (P < 0.001).
2:::Eyes from six INS (C94Y)pigs and six age-matched control littermates were analysed via histology and immunohistochemistry. For histological analyses of retinal (layer) thickness, sections were stained with H&E or Mallorys trichrome. For comparison of protein expression patterns and vessel courses, sections were stained with different antibodies in immunohistochemistry. Observed lesions were compared with reported pathologies in human diabetic retinopathy.'
3:::The cumulative incidence of CTS at 5 years for HS children treated with HCT + ERT was 51% compared with 47% for HS children treated with HCT alone. The incidence of CTS did not depend upon graft source, age at transplant, or sex. Median nerve conduction velocity for both sensory and motor potentials demonstrated significant improvement after carpal tunnel release.
2:::Fifty physically active men will participate in a 3-phase, randomized, placebo-controlled study. After completing a 14-d, energy-adequate, diet acclimation phase (protein: 1.6g∙kg(-1)∙d(-1); fat: 30% total energy intake), participants will be randomized to undergo a 28-d, 55% energy deficit phase with (DEF+TEST: 200mg testosterone enanthate per week) or without (DEF) exogenous testosterone. Diet and physical activity will be rigorously controlled. Recovery from the energy deficit (ad libitum diet, no testosterone) will be assessed until body mass has been recovered within ±2.5% of initial body mass. Body composition, stable isotope methodologies, proteomics, muscle biopsies, whole-room calorimetry, molecular biology, activity/sleep monitoring, personality and cognitive function assessments, functional MRI, and comprehensive biochemistries will be used to assess physiological and psychological responses to energy restriction and recovery feeding while volunteers are in an expected hypogonadal versus eugonadal state.
4:::Tissue temperatures in vicinity to ulcers were significantly lower in participants with CLI, with or without diabetes, compared to non-ischemic controls. MWR could be used for differential diagnosis of arterial ischemia in subjects with DFU.
3:::Twenty patients with clinical signs of implant infections were identified. Of them, 16 patients with clinical signs of implant infection underwent immediate implant exchange; 15 remained infection free, while 1 patient developed recurrent infection within a month, which was treated with device removal. The mean time to final reconstruction in the 15 infection free patients was 207 days, and the 4 patients who underwent removal without immediate replacement had a 75% rate of non-completion at over 500 days.
2:::Forty BPD patients and thirty-five controls were enrolled and scanned with a 3.0T Philips Ingenia scanner. Rs-fMRI and structural images were preprocessed by DPARSF based on SPM8 on the MATLAB platform. To evaluate BPD related brain function alterations comprehensively, we analyzed the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and seed based functional connectivity (seed-based FC), three data-driven algorithms of rs-fMRI. Results were multiply corrected by REST AlphaSim program at the level of p<0.05. Meanwhile, the correlation between imaging and psychological data was also performed in BPD patients.
3:::Planned contrasts showed that those in the WI+TXT condition showed significantly less weekend drinking than those in the AO and WI conditions. Although those in the WI+TXT condition showed significantly fewer HDEs compared to AO, it was not significantly different than the WI only condition. No differences were observed on alcohol-related problems.
4:::This is the first study that details the spectrum of Altmetric scores among neurosurgical journals. Social media presence for journals is important for greater outreach and engagement. Prediction of traditional citation using altmetrics data requires a future prospective study.
2:::Retrospective multicenter open-labelled study from December 2015 to June 2016. We analyzed the outcome of pregnancies in patients with obstetrical APS (Sydney criteria) and previous adverse obstetrical event despite low-dose aspirin and low-molecular weight heparin LMWH (LMWH) conventional treatment who experienced at least one subsequent pregnancy.
3:::Both stroking the partner and self-stroking were performed within a velocity range optimal for activating C-tactile cutaneous afferents. Being stroked, stroking the partner, and self-stroking were all perceived as pleasant. However, being stroked entailed the significantly highest pleasantness ratings, and being stroked was the only condition that significantly decreased heart rate. Individuals in satisfying relationships were more pleased to be touched by their partner and showed a greater decline in heart rate when being touched.
4:::In patients with simple compression fractures, attention should be paid to the posterior vertebral body and both endplates as well as the T1-weighted MRI findings to allow early detection of spinal canal compromise, which can have devastating consequences.
3:::On average, depressive symptoms decreased from pregnancy to 24 months postpartum; however, trajectories varied across women. Single relationship status, substance use, and trauma history were each predictors of higher depression levels at several points in time across the observed perinatal period. Single relationship status was also associated with decline in depressive symptoms followed by a rebound of symptoms at 22 months postpartum.
2:::A total of 147 individuals were assessed with Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R) and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), and statistical mediation analyses were conducted.
4:::At psychosocial assessment and the making of aftercare arrangements, combined methods of self-harm or another recent episode should be considered red-flag' indicators for attention to care.'
1:::Mammograms acquired with full-field digital mammography (FFDM) systems are provided in both ""for-processing' and ""for-presentation'' image formats. For-presentation images are traditionally intended for visual assessment by the radiologists. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using for-presentation images in computerized analysis and diagnosis of microcalcification (MC) lesions.'
3:::The quantitative image features of MC lesions from for-presentation images are highly consistent with that from for-processing images. The values of Pearsons correlation coefficient between features from the two formats range from 0.824 to 0.961 for the 10 MC image features, and from 0.871 to 0.963 for the 12 textural features. In detection of individual MCs, the FROC curve from for-presentation is similar to that from for-processing. In particular, at sensitivity level of 80%, the average number of false-positives (FPs) per image region is 9.55 for both for-presentation and for-processing images. Finally, for classifying MC lesions as malignant or benign, the area under the ROC curve is 0.769 in for-presentation, compared to 0.761 in for-processing (P = 0.436).'
2:::We enrolled consecutive patients with heart failure (3695 [66%] clinic outpatients, 2105 [34%] hospital in patients) from 108 centres in six geographical regions. We recorded baseline demographic and clinical characteristics and followed up patients at 6 months and 1 year from enrolment to record symptoms, medications, and outcomes. Time to death was studied with Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for demographic and clinical variables, medications, socioeconomic variables, and region. We used the explained risk statistic to calculate the relative contribution of each level of adjustment to the risk of death.
3:::Mean baseline coronary lumen diameters were similar in control, microvascular angina, and coronary artery disease patients. NPY constricted proximal coronary segments by 8±2%, 5±2% and 6±3% and distal segments by 14±2%, 11±2% and 10±2% in control, microvascular angina, and coronary artery disease patients, respectively (p=NS between groups). In patients with microvascular angina, ergonovine constricted proximal coronary segments by 7±1.5% and distal segments by 12.5±3% (p=NS vs. NPY). During NPY administration four microvascular angina patients developed chest pain, ST segment depression, and a marked lengthening of the contrast medium run off, in the absence of epicardial coronary artery spasm. Control individuals and coronary artery disease patients did not experience chest pain, ST segment shifts, or lengthening of the run off during NPY administration. Ergonovine administration caused chest pain and lengthening of the contrast run-off, in the absence of epicardial coronary artery spasm, in one microvascular angina patient.
4:::The economic cost of patients not turning up for scheduled appointments in the ASCS was greater than 3 million Euros for a non-attendance rate of the 13.8%, with Mijas High Resolution Centre being the centre that showed the lowest mean unitary cost per medical appointment.
2:::Full-mouth radiographs of 131 individuals with RA were examined and compared with 131 controls that were sex and age matched exactly with the diseased group. The total number of teeth, presence or absence of root canal filling, quality of root canal filling, quality of restoration, and periapical status were recorded.
3:::A total of 107 teeth were available for histologic examination, 25 teeth in CP2, 31 teeth in CP4, 27 teeth in CR2, and 24 teeth in CR4. Pairwise comparisons revealed statistically significant differences in the maximum depth of bacterial penetration for the following combinations: CP2-CR2, CP2-CR4, CP4-CR2, and CP4-CR4 (P < .001). Pairwise comparisons also revealed a statistically significant difference in the percentage of sectors lined with bacteria for CP2-CR2, CP2-CP4, and CP2-CR4 (P < .001).
4:::Anatomic correction is a surgical challenge. It provides excellent functional outcomes in survivors with a significant need for reoperation and a definite risk of death or transplantation. Normal LV function should be expected in most patients. LV dysfunction was not linked to PAB or pacemaker requirement but surgery without LV training had better long-term LV function. The Shumacker modification provided stable venous pathways. Iatrogenic atrioventricular block remains a challenge.
3:::Using baseline incidence, defined by the World Health Organization, the number of estimated excess cases for respiratory mortality, hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for respiratory diseases, and for cardiovascular diseases were 37, 39, 476, and 184 persons, respectively, from 21st March, 2014 to 20th March, 2015. Furthermore, 92% of mortality and morbidity cases occurred in days with PM10 concentrations lower than 150 μg/m(3). The highest percentage of person-days occurred for daily concentrations range of 100-109 μg/m(3), causing the maximum health end-points among the citizens of Kermanshah.
2:::Rates of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), adjuvant chemotherapy ± trastuzumab, endocrine treatment, mastectomy and post mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) were analyzed according to treatment periods with univariate and multivariate analysis. Overall and disease-free survivals were analyzed according to treatment periods adjusted for HR and then for tumor subtypes.
3:::A 59-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of left hemicranial headaches with ptosis and binocular diplopia. Clinical evaluation found left third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with mydriasis and ptosis. An MRI showed an enhancing lesion at the clivus with infiltration of left cavernous sinus. A trans-sphenoidal biopsy was performed, leading to diagnosis of metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent treatment and achieved clinical improvement.
4:::MSFA with BC resulted in adequate amounts of new bone formation allowing successful implant installation; adding EMD did not have a significant effect.
1:::Breast reconstruction (BR) makes an important positive contribution to the quality of life of many women who have undergone mastectomy for breast cancer. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the evidence for possible relationships between womens expectations of BR and their satisfaction with outcomes to inform and facilitate improved communication about BR options prior to initial surgery.'
2:::A systematic review of the literature reporting expectations of BR published between 1 January 1994 and 6 March 2017 identified 2107 initial search results. Twenty-one publications, reporting 20 studies (2288 participants), satisfied the selection criteria. Information on study aim and time frame, participation rate, design/methods, limitations/bias, results and conclusions, as well as participant clinical and demographic information, was reported. An overall quality score was generated for each study.
3:::Because children with Downs syndrome and cleft palate are susceptible to OME, we categorized OME into low-risk and high-risk groups (e.g., Down's syndrome and cleft palate), and recommended the appropriate treatment for each group.'
3:::With a follow-up of 32.87 months (standard deviation 12.04), at the end of treatment, amputation occurred in three of 112 patients because of recurrence of infection, and one patient died from other causes not related to the infection. The study population presented a rate of recurrence of infection of 2.70%.
2:::Thirty synthetic femora were divided into 3 groups, and vertical femoral neck osteotomies were made. Ten osteotomized femora were fixed with a CS configuration, 10 were fixed with 3 parallel screws in an IT configuration, and the remaining 10 osteotomized femora were fixed with a CHS construct. All groups were tested using a cyclic (up to 15,000 load cycles) axial loading protocol, and survivors were statically loaded to failure. Cycles to failure, load to failure, and stiffness were calculated. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival functions and were compared among fixation methods. The relationship between construct structural properties (maximum load and stiffness) and treatment were assessed using general linear modeling.
4:::The biomechanical performance of the CHS fixation method was superior to both the CS fixation method and the IT fixation method using a synthetic femoral model and this test protocol. Biomechanical performance of the latter 2 groups was indistinguishable. We recommend the use of CHS with the derotational screw construct for Pauwels III femoral neck fractures whenever possible.
3:::After eight weeks of study, the ashwagandha treatment group demonstrated significant improvements compared with the placebo group in both immediate and general memory, as evidenced by Wechsler Memory Scale III subtest scores for logical memory I (p = 0.007), verbal paired associates I (p = 0.042), faces I (p = 0.020), family pictures I (p = 0.006), logical memory II (p = 0.006), verbal paired associates II (p = 0.031), faces II (p = 0.014), and family pictures II (p = 0.006). The treatment group also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in executive function, sustained attention, and information-processing speed as indicated by scores on the Eriksen Flanker task (p = 0.002), Wisconsin Card Sort test (p = 0.014), Trail-Making test part A (p = 0.006), and the Mackworth Clock test (p = 0.009).
2:::Between 2010 and 2014, we assessed 257 donor hearts for QTc interval >500 milliseconds. Post-transplant outcomes included 1-year survival, 1-year freedom from any-treated rejection, 1-year freedom from cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) defined as stenosis ≥30% by angiography, and 1-year freedom from nonfatal major adverse cardiac events.
3:::Eleven thousand eight hundred thirty-five patients met criteria. Median donor age was 32 years, and median ischemic time was 4.9 hours. Cox modeling demonstrated that donor age 50-60 (adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.11) and ≥60 (adjusted HR: 1.42) were associated with reduced overall survival. Neither ischemic time nor interaction of ischemic time and donor age were significantly associated with overall survival. Subanalysis demonstrated that this finding held true for patients undergoing either single or bilateral lung transplantation.
4:::Early HBO therapy could significantly improve symptoms of hyperalgesia of neuropathic pain in rats, possibly via activation of the NO-cGMP-PKG signaling transduction pathway.
2:::Twenty-five consecutive patients were evaluated before and 8-50 weeks after initiating Reg therapy by monthly clinical, ultrasound and laboratory (thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), antithyroglobulin (TgAb) and antithyroid peroxidase (TPOAb)) evaluation.
3:::A total of 100 patients were included (age 70.7±9.7years, 95% male, body mass index 28.9±5.3kg/m(2), left ventricular ejection fraction 33.5±7.7%, New York Heart Association class III 65%. DLCO and oxygenation were significantly correlated with hypoxemic burden (p<0.05). Mean oxygen saturation, oxygen desaturation, C-reactive protein level and pH were significantly associated with CSA-CSR severity (p<0.05).
4:::The survey further identified the need for treatment guidelines and clinical decision support tools that can be applied at the bedside.
3:::A total of 894 separate admissions, representing 845 patients, were analysed. Our analysis shows that there was a 95% probability that survival to hospital discharge was more likely to occur when the maximum workload-to-nurse ratio was <40 and a more than 95% chance that death was more likely to occur when the ratio was >52. Patients exposed to a high workload/nurse ratio (≥52) for ≥1 day during their ICU stay had lower risk-adjusted odds of survival to hospital discharge compared to patients never exposed to a high ratio (odds ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.16-0.79).
2:::We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospective multicenter database. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) was defined by a score on the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) <15 or when features of delirium were noted. Potentially modifiable risk factors for SAE at ICU admission and its impact on mortality were investigated using multivariate logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazard modeling, respectively.
3:::BA significantly reduced the ischemic infarct volume (P<0.05), whereas CM was ineffective. Two processes and 10 network nodes were shared between ""BA vs CM"" and vehicle, but there were no overlapping pathways. Two pathways, three processes and 12 network nodes overlapped in ""BA vs CM"" and BA. The pure pharmacological mechanism of BA resulted in targeting of pathways related to development, G-protein signaling, apoptosis, signal transduction and immunity. The biological processes affected by BA were primarily found to correlate with apoptotic, anti-apoptotic and neurophysiological processes. Three network nodes changed from up-regulation to down-regulation, while mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6 (MAP2K6, also known as MEK6) changed from down-regulation to up-regulation in ""BA vs CM"" and vehicle. The changed nodes were all related to cell death and development.
1:::To determine whether the incidence of complications varies between among types of distal phalangeal fractures in a pediatric population.
2:::We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and radiographs of patients seen in the pediatric hand surgery clinic from 2011 to 2012 with a diagnosis of distal phalanx fracture. Patients were identified by International Classification of Diseases-Ninth Revision code (816.02 or 816.12). We reviewed 206 charts and included them in the study. Demographic data, location of the fracture, specific diagnosis, mechanism of injury, outcomes, and complications were recorded. The treating physicians clinically identified the outcomes and complications.
4:::Our study found that geriatric care was not superior to orthopedic directed management in the treatment of elderly patients with hip fractures in terms of in-hospital complications, and hospitalization times.
3:::The microdeletion harbors the NHS, SCLML1, and RAI2 genes and results in a phenotype consistent with NSH syndrome and developmental delay.
2:::The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify 5784 patients, aged 15 years or older, who were diagnosed with CML between 2007 and 2012 and whose insurance status was documented at diagnosis. The primary outcome was 5-year overall survival (OS). Covariates of interest included the age at diagnosis, race, ethnicity, sex, county-level socioeconomic status, and marital status. OS was evaluated with a log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier estimates.
3:::KA, TCA, and PCA averaged 1.06 (±0.85) D, 1.05 (±0.83) D, and 0.33 (±0.17) D. The error of the model to estimate TCA averaged zero with an SD of ±0.21 D. Application of this model and of direct Pentacam TCA measurements in TIOL calculation gave similar results, namely a slight reduction of overcorrection in with-the-rule astigmatism, but an eradication of undercorrection in against-the-rule astigmatism.
2:::Radiographs and 3D reconstructed CT were anonymized and randomized before review by 4 board certified physicians using a standardized questionnaire and compared to a gold-standard axial CT by a fifth board certified physician.
4:::A Research and EBP course is an effective way to improve student perceptions of and confidence in research and EBP, increasing the likelihood of applying these skills to future nursing practice.
3:::Among THC-positive blood samples, 76% also tested positive for CBD. There was a strong correlation between THC- and CBD concentrations in blood samples (Pearsons r=0.714, p<0.0005). Subjects judged as impaired by a CTI had significantly higher THC- (p<0.001) and CBD (p=0.008) concentrations compared with not impaired subjects, but after multivariate analyses, impairment could only be related to THC concentration (p=0.004). Analyzing seizures revealed THC/CBD ratios of 2:1 for hashish and 200:1 for marijuana.'
2:::Pharmacy technicians led the medicines reablement initiative. They delivered a competency-based training programme for frontline health and social care staff. They assessed and set goals with patients to facilitate independence in self-administration of their medication. The pharmacy technicians provided on-going support to staff helping patients to reable. They reassessed patients after six weeks to determine if medicines reablement had been successful or whether further input was needed. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews with pharmacy technicians, frontline staff, managers, and patients. Findings Twenty per cent of patients discharged from hospital to intermediate care were assessed to be suitable for medicines reablement. Of these patients, 44% were successfully reabled and a further 25% benefited from the input of a pharmacy technician. Patients and staff were positive about medicines reablement, emphasising the importance of patients attaining independence for self-administration of medication. Although following training, health and social care staff felt confident in facilitating medicines reablement they valued on-going access to pharmacy technicians for timely support, help with problem solving, and advice throughout the reablement process.
3:::Arytenoid abduction (higher LRQ) was greater with FASTak II construct than either of the suture patterns. The largest difference occurred at 5N. Approximately 50% less force was required to achieve an LRQ of 1.0 with the FASTak II anchor compared to the suture patterns. No difference was detected between the 2 suture constructs throughout the study.
4:::A detailed framework for a structured TaTME training curriculum has been proposed. It encompasses various training modalities and assessment, as well as having the potential to provide quality control and future research initiatives for this novel technique.
2:::Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive carboplatin/paclitaxel with veliparib, 120 mg (n = 105), or placebo (n = 53). Patients were stratified by histologic subtype and smoking history (recent smokers [n = 95], former smokers [n = 42], and never-smokers [n = 21]). Plasma cotinine level was measured as a chemical index of smoking. Mutation status was assessed by whole exome sequencing (n = 38).
3:::The study encompassed 27,425 MRI examinations. Overall volume peaked at baseline and then declined over the following quarters. Compared with baseline, untrained sites experienced significant drops in equipment utilization (P < .01 for the first quarter of FY16 and P < .0001 for the second quarter of FY16 and Q3 FY16), decreasing from 77% to 65% over the study period, corresponding to a decrease from 1.15 to 0.97 in hourly scan rates. For trained sites, these metrics showed no significant change, with maintenance of hourly scan rates of 1.23 and 1.27 and equipment utilization rates of 83% and 85% between baseline and Q3 FY16. No-show rates remained stable at trained sites but increased at untrained sites in the last two quarters (P < .05). Nationally benchmarked patient satisfaction percentile ranking gradually increased at trained sites from 56th at baseline to 70th and successively decreased at untrained sites from 66th to 44th.
3:::Isthmic spondylolisthesis occurred from L3 to S1 and mostly occurred at two consecutive spinal levels (i.e., L4-L5 and L5-S1). Significant improvements in the ODI and visual analog scale were observed in patients at final follow up (p<0.05). The mean segmental lordosis significantly increased after operation (from 22.7° to 32.7°). The mean lumbar lordosis significantly increased after operation (from 45.8 to 53.1). Radiographs of all of the patients showed solid fusion at the last follow-up. There was one case of screw fracture at the S1 level; however, in this case the last follow-up radiograph exhibited solid fusion.
4:::Current major depression or depression symptoms may promote tobacco dependence, persistence and relapse by increasing sensitivity to both acute negative mood and abstinence induced tobacco-seeking behavior. Treatments should seek to break the association between adverse states and smoking to cope.
2:::20 TRD patients who underwent a course of rTMS to the left DLPFC were categorized into R and NR groups based on a >50% reduction in HRSD scores. Utilizing resting-state fMRI and ICA techniques, this study compared baseline RSNs of R vs. NR as well as TRD vs. healthy volunteer group. Regression analysis was conducted to link regions with clinical improvements. ROC analysis was further conducted to confirm the utility of the identified regions in classifying the patients.
3:::There were no differences between AgP and H groups with regard to MCP-1 and CCR2 genotype distribution and allele frequencies (p>0.05). In contrast, the MCP-1 mRNA expression levels were higher in homozygous ""AA"" control subjects than having G(+) genotype and AA homozygous AgP patients.
4:::Maternal depressive symptoms and pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms were both associated with decrements in visuospatial working memory/executive functioning. Depressive symptoms seem to present more stable relationship with cognitive deficits, while pregnancy-related anxiety was associated only concurrently. Future studies could investigate, how stable these cognitive differences are, and whether they affect maternal ability to deal with demands of pregnancy and later parenting.
2:::104 patients who underwent TAVR with the CoreValve prosthesis were studied retrospectively. Luminal attenuation (LA) in HU was measured at the level of the aortic annulus. Calcium volume score for the aortic valvular complex was measured using 6 threshold cutoffs (650 HU, 850 HU, LA × 1.25, LA × 1.5, LA+50, LA+100). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the predictive value for > mild PVR (n = 16). Multivariable analysis was performed to determine the accuracy to predict > mild PVR after adjustment for depth and perimeter oversizing.
3:::A total of 134 screws were inserted into the C2 pedicle (30 screws), superior (35 screws) or inferior (17 screws) articular process of C2, and lateral mass of C3 (52 screws). There was a significant statistical difference between the preoperative and postoperative results in the reduction of the odontoid process, decompression of the upper cervical spinal cord and medulla, as well as the improvement of neurologic functions (P < 0.05). All patients have exhibited a major neurologic improvement and solid bony fusion.
4:::Two thirds of patients with an AChA stroke have a perfusion deficit on MRI, higher admission NIHSS, and larger DWI lesion size at presentation.
2:::The study population consisted of participants randomized to receive ICM in a multi-center trial. The Reveal LINQ™ ICM was implanted using provided insertion tools, either in an electrophysiology laboratory or outpatient procedure room. If device sensing was insufficient in the first subcutaneous position, one or more repositions were performed. Patients were urged to make contact if they suspected any AE. Furthermore, follow-up for safety endpoints consisted of evaluation of medical records and planned study visits.
3:::1420 patients received an ICM, 753 (53%) in a procedure room and 667 (47%) in an electrophysiology laboratory. During a median follow-up of 499days, 9 (0.63%) and 15 (1.13%) patients experienced AEs with and without need for device explantation, respectively. In the 38 patients requiring device repositioning, more AEs requiring explantation were seen (3 (7.9%) vs. 6 (0.4%), p=0.001). Patients undergoing implantation in a procedure room had more infections (12 (1.6%) vs. 1 (0.1%), p=0.004), though no significant difference was reached in AEs requiring explantation (7 (0.9%) vs. 2 (0.3%), p=0.19).
3:::Using a rigid endoscope and a single trajectory, we were able to perform a transforaminal ETV and a transseptal, transcaval, interforniceal biopsy of the tumor.
4:::In this retrospective study with over 5000 patients, implantation of both trifocal IOL models provided good functional distance, intermediate, and near visual acuity, resulting in high levels of both spectacle independence and patient satisfaction.
2:::Fifty-one clinical isolates and four reference strains were tested. These isolates included 40, 4, and 11 IMP-, New Delhi MBL (NDM)-, and non-MBL-producers, respectively. SMA-DDST was performed with meropenem (MEPM)-containing disks.
3:::The challenges faced by older nurses in their practice are synthesised across three primary domains: Nursing and the ageing body; Recognition and support of the older nurse and Demands associated with middle-age.
4:::In Japanese patients undergoing permanent brachytherapy alone for prostate cancer, the sexual function is not well preserved. However, decreased sexual function does not seem to represent a major factor determining patients overall satisfaction. These findings might be peculiar to Japanese patients, in whom elderly subjects account for the majority.'
3:::Peptides 25 (241-251) and 29 (282-296) induced the highest IL-10 production by CD4 T cells. These peptides also inhibited the peak T cell proliferative response. 6 and 10 weeks after peptide inhalation, the total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a in mice treated with both peptides 241-251 and 282-296 were significantly higher than control (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference in the mean hematocrit between of the peptide-treated mice and the control group was found.
2:::We prospectively investigated the effectiveness and safety of an ERAS protocol with laparoscopic omega loop gastric bypass (""mini"" gastric bypass, MGB) and LSG in morbidly obese patients.
1:::Miscibility between the drug and the polymer in an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) is considered to be one of the most important factors impacting the solid state stability and dissolution performance of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The research described herein utilizes emerging fluorescence-based methodologies to probe (im)miscibility of itraconazole (ITZ)-hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) ASDs.
3:::Mean age of the cohort was 72.8±11.2years, 1187 (50.5%) were women, and 1252 (53.4%) and 410 (17.5%) showed HFpEF and HFmrEF, respectively. At a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 2.3 (0.8-4.5) years, we registered 1114 (47.6%) deaths, and 1834 HF-related rehospitalizations in 943 (40.2%) patients. After multivariable adjustment, and compared to patients with normal PASP, severe PH exhibited an independent higher risk of recurrent HF admissions only in HFpEF (IRR=1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.16-2.38; p=0.005), whereas in HFmrEF patients there was a non-significant trend to higher HF readmissions (IRR: 1.73; 95% CI, 0.85-3.55; p=0.132). Severe PH was not related with recurrent hospitalizations in HFrEF (IRR: 1.19; 95% CI, 0.66-2.14; p=0.553).
2:::The exons and flanking sequences of NKX2.1, FOXE1, NKX2.5, PAX8, and TSHR were screened by next-generation sequencing and further confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing. The mutation frequencies were calculated and compared against databases. The relationship between genotype and phenotype was also determined.
4:::Environmental epidemiology informing disease prevention will continue to be valuable. However, the field must adapt to remain relevant. In particular, the field must ensure that public health importance drives research questions, while seizing the opportunities presented by new technologies. Environmental epidemiologists of the future will require different, refined skills to work effectively across disciplines, ask the right questions, and implement appropriate study designs in a data-rich world.
3:::Severity of OCD (as indexed by higher scores on the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised) was unrelated to frequency and quantity of cannabis use, but it was significantly, positively related to increased cannabis misuse. These effects persisted after controlling for anxiety, depression, and stress. The specific feature of obsessing was found to consistently predict cannabis misuse. Finally, an indirect effect of severity of OCD on cannabis misuse via coping motives was discovered.
2:::A qualitative descriptive study design provided an opportunity for student voices to be heard. Ethical approval was sought and granted. Eleven students were interviewed nearing completion of a four year BSc Nursing programme. Data analysis followed a thematic approach, in generating themes.
3:::We identified 6,026 index trauma admissions, with 158 (2.6%) unplanned readmissions within 30 days of discharge. The most common reasons for readmission were disease/symptom progression (30.2%), wound complications (28.9%), and pain control (11.8%). On multivariate analysis, only Injury Severity Score (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.05; p=0.016), penetrating injuries (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.12-3.24; p=0.018), and smoking (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.05-2.86; p=0.031) were found to be significant. Hospital length of stay, insurance status, and race were not significant.
2:::In this study, we evaluated the dose-response efficacy of levetiracetam (12.5-100.0 mg/kg) and gabapentin (1.25-25.0 mg/kg) administered either individually or in pairs at fixed-dose ratios as a combination in mitigating posttraumatic nonconvulsive seizures induced by severe penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI) in rats. Seizures were detected by continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring for 72 hours postinjury. Animals were treated twice per day for 3 days by intravenous injections.
3:::Ninety patients were matched into 45 pairs. There was significant improvement (P = .039) in locoregional control with PORT (84%) compared with surgery alone (60%), which was concentrated in the pN1 subgroup (P = .036), but not the pN0 subgroup (P = .331).
4:::Our data indicate that patients with indolent disease may be candidates for limited treatment with adjuvant endocrine therapy based on their very low risk of distant recurrences or death of breast cancer.
2:::A literature search of the EMBASE and PubMed databases of the last 16 years (2000-2016) was performed. Studies that evaluated the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), three-phase bone scintigraphy (TPBS), white blood cell (WBC) or antigranulocyte antibody (AGA) scintigraphy, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and plain computed tomography (CT) in diagnosing PTO were considered for inclusion. The review was conducted using the PRISMA statement and QUADAS-2 criteria.
3:::With use of the MS/MS GAA assay in DBS, 96% of the pseudodeficiency newborns and all of the Pompe disease carriers were well separated from the IOPD and LOPD newborns. The fluorimetric assay separated <10% of the pseudodeficiencies from the IOPD/LOPD group.
4:::Commercial gingival retraction products exhibit antimicrobial effects to various degrees in vitro. Some products display rapid bactericidal activity. The antimicrobial activity is not owing to the retraction-active agents. Biofilm bacteria are less sensitive to the antimicrobial effects of the agents.
2:::A 62-year-old female presented with a deeply pigmented and exophytic lesion in the left tonsillar fossa. The patient underwent a partial pharyngectomy through a midline labio-mandibulotomy approach along with a left level I-V neck dissection. Reconstruction with a left radial forearm free flap and a pharyngeal constrictor advancement pharyngoplasty was performed.
3:::A significant proportion of paediatricians (21-52%) did not regularly use CMA for conditions with established evidence of diagnostic yield. Paediatricians under-estimated the potential for CMA findings to alter patient management. There was wide variability in paediatricians approach to consent, and low use of consent forms and fact sheets. Paediatricians reported difficulties interpreting CMA results, with high rates of referral to clinical genetics services.'
3:::A significant association between neighbourhood-level coverage of improved household sanitation and diarrhoeal morbidity (OR [95% CI] = 0.68 [0.62-0.76]) was found. Exposure-relationship analyses results showed improved sanitation coverage threshold at 0.6. We found marginal degree of association (OR [95% CI] = 0.82 [0.77-0.87]) below the threshold, which, beyond the threshold, sharply increased to OR of 0.44 (95% CI: 0.29-0.67) at sanitation coverage of 1 (i.e. neighbourhood-wide use of improved household sanitation). Similar exposure-response trends were identified for urban and rural subgroups.
4:::Our findings suggest that neighbourhood sanitation plays a key role in reducing diarrhoeal diseases and that increase in sanitation coverage may only have minimal impact on diarrhoeal illness, unless sufficiently high coverage is achieved.
2:::Patients with IBD in durable remission on combination therapy were enrolled in a 1-year, open-label, prospective trial after randomisation into three groups: AZA steady (2-2.5 mg/kg/day, n=28) vs AZA down (dose was halved 1-1.25 mg/kg/day, n=27) vs AZA stopped (n=26). Primary endpoint was failure defined as occurrence of a clinical relapse and/or any change in IBD therapy.
3:::Markedly higher EXT-1 was observed in mature odontoblasts than in pulp at mRNA level with DNA microarray and PCR techniques. Immunohistochemistry of mature tooth revealed EXT-1 both in odontoblasts and the predentin but not in the dentin. EXT-1 was also observed in the odontoblasts of incomplete root, but the localization of the staining was different. In developing foetal tooth, staining was detected in ameloblasts and the basal lamina.
4:::The results of this network meta-analysis show that bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel-topotecan or paclitaxel-cisplatin is likely to prolong OS over other non-bevacizumab-containing chemotherapies (eg, paclitaxel-carboplatin), which were not included in the GOG240 trial. In patients with advanced, persistent, and recurrent cervical cancer, cisplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab and topotecan-paclitaxel-bevacizumab showed the highest efficacy in all regimens investigated in this analysis.
3:::Seventy-four drowned patients were included, of which 36 (49%) were diagnosed by the clinician as having early pneumonia. Concerning the overall population, the median simplified acute physiology score (version 2) was 45 (30-65), and the mortality was 26%. Twenty-four respiratory samples from different patients were obtained within the first 48 h. Sixteen were positive. The main microorganisms found were Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Streptococcus pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus) with a low rate of antimicrobial resistance. No MDR bacteria or fungi were identified. However, among the positive respiratory samples collected, 5/16 (31%) grew bacteria with natural resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate, the first-line antibiotic commonly used in our cohort. Resistance was only found among Gram-negative bacteria and from respiratory samples of patients with a higher drowning grade at admission (p = 0.01).
1:::To determine the annual incidence of visual impairment in a Japanese population during a 10-year period.
2:::We examined the physical disability certificates issued yearly between 2004 and 2013 in Mie prefecture, Japan. During this period 2468 visually impaired people were registered under the newly defined Act on Welfare of the Physically Disabled Persons criteria. The age, sex distribution, and causes of visual impairment were determined from the certificates.'
3:::The compressive and cooling effect of the system was well tolerated by all the patients at the temperature set. Four patients complained of noise due to machine operation, but in none the treatment was interrupted. The average length of hospital stay was 2.8±0.4days. No clinically significant hematoma was observed at discharge and after one month follow-up visit.
4:::This new system can be used for the management of the early phase after device implantation or replacement and appears clinically useful and well tolerated. Further studies on a larger scale are needed to test the potential reduction of post-intervention complications and the cost-effectiveness of this device.
2:::A retrospective search was undertaken on all patients with IgM antibodies to CMV and EBV during the period of 2006-2015 in the virological database of the University Hospital of Iceland covering the metropolitan area of Reykjavík (population 202,255). Patients with available liver tests at the University Hospital and/or admitted to this institution were included and relevant clinical data obtained from medical records.
3:::Of the 182 patients, 46.7% (n=85) achieved an SVR. Twenty-seven patients developed hepatic decompensation (one SVR) and 15 developed HCC (three SVR). Twenty-nine patients died (eight SVR). Twelve of the 29 deaths were liver related (two SVR). Independent factors associated with hepatic decompensation were NR to treatment [hazard ratio (HR)=23.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.90-189.25; P=0.003], advanced fibrosis at baseline (HR=9.11; 95% CI: 4.13-20.09), and treatment delay after diagnosis (HR=1.02; 95% CI: 1.00-1.03; P=0.012). Only the latter two were associated with HCC development and liver-related mortality. An assessment of liver fibrosis was performed on 125 patients (66 SVR). Fibrosis values were significantly lower in SVR patients, showing less progression to advanced stages of fibrosis [SVR: 6.6 (2.8); 95% CI: 5.8-7.3] than NR [NR: 14.0 (11.1); 95% CI: 11.1-16.9; P<0.001].
4:::Mild laboratory-confirmed influenza infection is common in children during influenza seasons. Influenza vaccination is effective against ILI but not mild infection identified by surveillance.
2:::This single-centre study enrolled patients scheduled for transthoracic oesophagectomy in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial between March 2013 and January 2016. Enrolled patients were randomized with a 1 : 1 parallel allocation ratio to either landiolol prophylaxis or placebo. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of atrial fibrillation after oesophagectomy. Secondary endpoints were incidence of postoperative complications, and effects on haemodynamic and inflammatory indices.
3:::It has been evidenced that positively and negatively singly charged aggregates at low collision energy decompose preferentially by loss of only one DMEB molecule. Increasing the collision energy, the loss of neutrals becomes increasingly abundant. Multiply charged DMEB aggregates are unstable and decompose forming singly charged monomers or dimers. MD simulations show reverse micelle-like structures with polar heads somewhat segregated into the aggregate interior. Finally, a good correlation between experimental and calculated collisional cross sections (CCS) was found.
2:::Three available HFNC devices were evaluated: the AIRVO 2 device and 2 mechanical ventilators (SV300 and Monnal T75). A device consisting of a test lung (5600i) and an airway model (AMT(IE)) was used to simulate spontaneous breathing. The flows ranged from 0 to their maximum flow with an interval of 10 L/min. The pressures were measured at 4 sites (nasopharynx, supraglottis, carina, and lung) under compliances of 50 and 100 mL/cm H2O and tidal volume of 300, 500, and 700 mL with the mouth closed or open. The influencing factors were determined by multiple linear regression. The sum of squares reduction test was used to compare working curves of PEEP effect among 3 devices. Pairwise comparisons were conducted by using Tukeys multiple comparisons test within an overlap of flow from 0 to 50 L/min.'
3:::A quadratic curved relationship between PEEP and flow was observed (coefficients were 8.97 × 10(-3) for flow and 4.79 × 10(-4) for a quadratic element of flow, respectively) but evanished when the mouth was open. The PEEP increased along with lung compliance (coefficient was 2.58 × 10(-3)). Despite the difference in working curves, both the mechanical ventilators performed slightly better than the AIRVO 2 device at higher flows (40 and 50 L/min).
4:::In this series of five ADCY5 mutation carriers, perioral twitches and truncal jerks do not represent myokymia. In view of characteristic clinical signs and electrophysiological patterns with a combination of myoclonus and chorea it might be preferable to refer to these phenomena as myoclonus-chorea.
3:::Median (interquartile range) follow-up time was 2.8 (2.4-3.8)years. The cumulative incidence proportions of the primary endpoint at 1 and 3years were 6.4% and 11.5% in high-GRS patients vs. 2.5% and 7.3% in low-GRS patients. The corresponding relative risks were 2.56 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-5.07), and 1.57 (95% CI 1.02-2.44). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of the primary endpoint was 1.50 (95% CI 1.00-2.25). The most pronounced effect of a high GRS was observed on coronary revascularisations (adjusted HR 2.10 [95% CI 1.08-4.07]). Risks of cardiovascular death (adjusted HR 1.07 [95% CI 0.46-2.48]) and all-cause death (adjusted HR 1.15 [95% CI 0.65-2.03]) were unaffected.
2:::College students (N=239) at a large South Central university completed self-report measures of demographics, alcohol use and consequences, use of PBS, and trait mindfulness.
3:::The prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 was, respectively, 28% and 12.6% (maternal side) and 29.9% and 8.3% (fetal side). All HSV-positive women were asymptomatic. Sexual behavior, vaginal delivery, and presence of HSVs on one side of the placenta were risk factors associated with HSV infection.
1:::Models relating perimetric sensitivities to ganglion cell numbers have been proposed for combining structural and functional measures from patients with glaucoma. Here we compared seven models for ability to differentiate progressing and stable patients, testing the hypothesis that the model incorporating local spatial scale would have the best performance.
4:::Two very different approaches for testing the hypothesis both gave a negative result. For all seven ganglion cell models, rates of ganglion cell loss were highly affected by fluctuations in height of the hill of vision. Methods for reducing effects of between-visit variability are needed in order to assess progression by relating perimetric sensitivities and ganglion cell numbers.
3:::44,814 patients from 474 hospitals in 27 countries were available for analysis. Death was more frequent amongst patients admitted directly to critical care after surgery (critical care: 103/4317 patients [2%], standard ward: 99/39,566 patients [0.3%]; adjusted OR 3.01 [2.10-5.21]; p < 0.001). This association may differ with national income (high income countries OR 2.50 vs. low and middle income countries OR 4.68; p = 0.07). At hospital level, there was no association between mortality and critical care admission directly after surgery (p = 0.26), critical care admission to treat complications (p = 0.33), or provision of critical care beds (p = 0.70). Findings of the hospital-level analyses were not affected by national income status. A sensitivity analysis including only high-risk patients yielded similar findings.
2:::Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced electrically in anaesthetised healthy adult pigs and left untreated for seven minutes followed by randomisation to manual ventilation with 50% or 100% oxygen and mechanical chest compressions (LUCAS(®)). Defibrillation was performed at thirteen minutes and repeated if necessary every two minutes with 1mg intravenous adrenaline. Cerebral oxygenation was measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (rSO2, INVOS™5100C Cerebral Oximeter) and with a probe (NEUROVENT-PTO, RAUMEDIC) in the frontal brain cortex (PbO2). Heart biopsies were obtained 20min after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) with an analysis of mitochondrial respiration (OROBOROS Instruments Corp., Innsbruck, Austria), and compared to four control animals without VF and CPR. Brain rSO2 and PbO2 were log transformed and analysed with a mixed linear model and mitochondrial respiration with an analysis of variance.
4:::The use of 50% oxygen during CPR results in lower cerebral oximetry values compared to 100% oxygen but there is no difference in brain tissue oxygen. Cardiac arrest disturbs cardiac mitochondrial respiration, but it is not alleviated with the use of 50% compared to 100% oxygen (Ethical and hospital approvals ESAVI/1077/04.10.07/2016 and HUS/215/2016, §7 30.3.2016, Funding Helsinki University and others).
3:::Ankle fusion was achieved in 100% of patients treated with external fixation and in 88% with internal stabilization. Desired frontal plane alignment was achieved in 100% of patients with external fixation and 76% with internal stabilization. Desired sagittal plane alignment was achieved in 100% of external fixation and 85% of internal stabilization. A total of 14 (48.3%) patients from group 1 showed a radiographic evidence of pre-existing adjacent-joint OA. The radiographic evidence of pre-existing adjacent-joint OA was also found in 27(81.8%) subjects from group 2. Alterations of adjacent joints were also found on postoperative radiograms of 19 (65.5%) patients subjected to Ilizarov fixation and in all 33 patients from group 2.
2:::Daily EDVDBs were collected from a hospital appointed for dog bites in Beijing during 2012-2014. A quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was employed to estimate the impact of temperature on daily EDVDBs. Stratified analysis was performed to examine the temperature-EDVDB association by sex and age-groups. Sensitivity analysis was performed to check the robustness of the results by adjusting other meteorological variables and air pollutants.
4:::Depression and insomnia, both individually and as part of an interrelated pathway, partially mediate the relationship between distress and QOL. Appropriate interventions to alleviate insomnia and depression may mitigate the negative impacts of distress on QOL in cancer patients.
3:::Participants with PTSD demonstrated a slower decrease in overall SCR responses during extinction and greater negative appraisals compared to the group. A moderation analysis revealed that both negative trauma-relevant appraisals and fear extinction learning were independently associated with PTSD symptoms, but there was no moderation interaction.
3:::Median survival from diagnosis of first MBO was 2.5 months. Median survival after dPEG placement was 37 days. In univariate analysis, dPEG placement, complications, longer length of stay, and readmissions were significantly associated with worse OS. Receipt of dPEG was significantly associated with younger age, longer length of stay at first admission, and shorter interval to readmission. In patients who received dPEG, longer interval from MBO diagnosis to dPEG placement did not affect OS.
2:::EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor naïve advanced NSCLC patients who carried EGFRm in both tissues and ctDNA were enrolled in this study. Plasma samples were collected at three time-points within one day (at 8 am, 11 am and 2 pm) for EGFRm analysis by droplet digital PCR.
4:::The myeloperoxidase activity in paw and NOx and NFkB levels in spinal cord are related to antinociceptive properties of BPIS in CIA model.
3:::The prevalence of IGD in the total samples ranged from 0.7% to 27.5%. The prevalence was higher among males than females in the vast majority of studies and tended to be higher among younger rather than older people in some studies. Geographical region made little difference to prevalence. Factors associated with IGD were reported in 28 of 37 cross-sectional studies. These were diverse and covered gaming, demographic and familial factors, interpersonal relations, social and school functioning, personality, psychiatric comorbidity, and physical health conditions. Longitudinal studies identified risk and protective factors, and health and social consequences of IGD. The natural course of IGD was diverse but tended to be more stable among adolescents compared to adults.
2:::Data of 284 consecutive patients who had undergone EBUS-TBNA was collected. Two hundred patients had suspected NSCLC, with 148 confirmed NSCLC cases. The diagnostic utility of EBUS-TBNA was determined according to NSCLC stage, EBUS lymph node size, PET SUV, use in distal metastases, and mutation testing. The utility of neck ultrasound for N3 disease was calculated in patients with bulky mediastinal disease.
1:::To evaluate the safety and tolerability of and clinical response to a single, subretinal dose of human umbilical tissue-derived cells (palucorcel [CNTO-2476]) in the eyes of adults aged ≥50 years with bilateral geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
3:::The most affected finger was the right middle finger. All flaps survived and wounds healed in 14 days on average. The mucous cyst recurred in 1 of 33 cases. There were no major complications.
4:::The Zitelli bilobed flap can provide good-quality skin coverage over the distal interphalangeal joint in a short period.
2:::Between May 2009 and February 2015, 273 lesions in 266 patients were subjected to miniprobe EUS after CE and curative treatment for well-to-moderately differentiated early gastric cancer (EGC). We reviewed preoperative CE and EUS findings and compared them to the pathologic findings.
3:::A total of 13 eligible studies were found, most of them were performed in Taiwan and focused on skin and bladder cancer. The positive association between %MMA and various types of cancer was consistent, in contrast to the negative relationship between %DMA and cancer that was inconsistent. The summary risk of bladder (OR=1.79; 95% CI: 1.42, 2.26, n=4 studies) and lung (OR=2.44; 95% CI: 1.57, 3.80, n=2 studies) cancer increased significantly with increasing %MMA, without statistical heterogeneity. In contrast, lung cancer risk was inversely related to %DMA (OR=0.58; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.93, n=2 studies), also without significant heterogeneity. These results were similar after stratifying by epidemiological design and total As in urine. No evidence of publication bias was found.
2:::A retrospective cohort study with additional telephone interview to obtain missing data was performed. All patients who underwent an L4-L5 or L5-S1 ALIF-procedure, or both, in the period between 2006 and 2011 were identified. The medical files of 123 patients with 154 fusion levels were reviewed. All patients were contacted by telephone to gather supplementary and missing information. Pain and functionality scores (Visual Analogue Scale [VAS] and Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]), radiologic (intervertebral disc height, Modic and Pfirrmann classifications), and different clinical parameters were gathered.
4:::The ALIF technique is a durable treatment option for patients with DDD. This study suggests different predictive parameters for treatment outcome.
3:::AF sources arose in 96/97 (99%) patients for 2.6±1.4 sources per patient (left atrium: 1.7±0.9 right atrium: 1.1±0.8), each with an area of 2-3cm(2). On area analyses, the probability of an AF source randomly overlapping a GP area was 26%. Left atrial sources were seen in 94 (97%) patients, in whom ≥1 source co-localized with GP in 75 patients (80%; p<0.05). AF sources were more likely to colocalize with left vs right GPs (p<0.05), and colocalization was more likely in patients with higher CHADS2VASc scores (age>65, diabetes; p<0.05).
4:::The reliability of the offline 2D-cUS cerebellar size assessments is good, and TCD-MF is the most consistent measure. Further studies should address the predictive value for the neurodevelopmental outcome of serial cerebellar size assessments by 2D-cUS for preterm infants.
2:::Animals were randomly divided into the following groups and treated: (1) Control (saline), (2) LPS (1mg/kg i.p.), (3-5) 2, 5 or 10mg/kg TQ extract 30min before LPS injection. The treatment was started since two weeks before the behavioral experiments and continued during the behavioral tests (LPS injected 2h before each behavioral experiment). Finally, the brains were removed for biochemical assessments.
3:::HOK expressed the receptors LPA1, LPA5 and LPA6 and LPA activated the ERK1/2, JNK and p38 intracellular pathways, substantiated by secretion of IL-6 and IL-8. The early (2h) and intermediate (6h) gene expression profiles of HOK after LPA treatment showed a wide array of regulated genes. The majority of the strongest upregulated genes were related to chemotaxis and inflammation, and became downregulated after 6h. At 6h, genes coding for factors involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and re-epithelialization became highly expressed. IL-36γ, not earlier known to be regulated by LPA, was strongly transcribed and translated but not secreted.
3:::A total of 445 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of breast were diagnosed during the study period. The median age of diagnosis was 67 years. The overall age-adjusted incidence between 1998 and 2013 was 0.62 per 1,000,000 per year, and the incidence has been on a decline. Approximately half of the tumors were poorly differentiated. Stage II was the most common stage at presentation. Majority of the cases were negative for expression of estrogen and progesterone receptor. One-third of the cases underwent breast conservation surgery while more than half of the cases underwent mastectomy (unilateral or bilateral). Approximately one-third of cases received radiation treatment. The 1-year and 5-year cause-specific survival was 81.6 and 63.5%, respectively. Excluding patient with metastasis or unknown stage at presentation, in multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, older age at diagnosis and higher tumor stage (T3 or T4) or nodal stage at presentation were significant predictors of poor survival.
4:::Our study describes the unique characteristics of squamous cell carcinoma of breast and demonstrates that it is an aggressive tumor with a poor survival. Older age and higher tumor or nodal stages at presentation were independent predictors of poor survival for loco-regional stages.
1:::Parallel to increasing survival of breast cancer (BC) patients, a need has arisen to characterize the follow-up required to improve and maintain their health. Our study aimed to assess changes in lifestyle habits over time among the study population, compare compliance rates of selected primary and secondary prevention practices between long-term BC survivors and an age-matched comparison group, and identify factors associated with compliance to these practices.
2:::A cross-sectional study was carried out in 21 adult IGHD subjects, and 21 age- and gender-matched controls. Objective sleep assessment included polygraphic records of the awake, stages NREM [N1 (drowsiness), N2 and N3 (already sleeping)] and REM (R). Subjective evaluation included the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Insomnia Severity Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.
3:::Pathogens were detected in 71% of patients, and identified as the source of infection in 52% (104/200). The majority of patients suffered from Streptococcus pneumoniae (32/200), Haemophilus influenzae (22/200), and Moraxella catarrhalis (16/200). Gram stain guided pathogen-oriented therapy decisions for 38 of 96 patients with unknown pathogens. Atypical pathogens were only diagnosed in CAP patients (n = 5). Severity of pneumonia was related to male sex (p = 0.006), and preexisting conditions, such as chronic heart failure (p < 0.001) and COPD (p < 0.001). Risk factors associated with increased length of stay included chronic heart failure, chronic renal failure, other pulmonary diseases and diabetes. Mortality for NHCAP patients was associated with lung cancer and bronchiectasis. CAP patients were more frequently admitted during winter months, while NHCAP patients were admitted during all other seasons. Seasonal patterns for individual pathogens could not be determined.
2:::Central pathology review was performed by six reference pathologists. Gender, age, performance status, time from first presentation with sarcoma to starting palliative chemotherapy, tumor grade, histological subgroup, primary tumor site involvement, and sites of metastases were assessed as prognostic factors.
4:::Emotional abuse and domestic violence are strong risk factors for major depression for females. Early intervention to prevent maltreatment and its consequences is critical, especially for girls exposed to poly-maltreatment.
3:::The study recorded 68,390 patients; 93.8% were from the public hospitals. There were seven male for every three female patients, and 50% were 20-39 years of age. About 69.3% were unintentional injuries. Among injuries with a known mechanism (19,102), 51.1% were road traffic injuries (RTIs) and 17.5% were falls. Female, patients aged 60 years or older, patients transferred by ambulance, patients who had RTIs, and patients with intentional injuries were more likely to be hospitalized.
2:::A total of 403 consecutive patients (35% females; median age, 67 years; age range 18-97 years) with either pacemakers (n=246), implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), (n=117) or cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) (n=40) applied to our hospitals outpatient pacemaker clinic for follow-up. These patients had been followed up by industry representatives alone until September 2013 and then by a cardiologist who is dealing with cardiac electrophysiology and has a knowledge of CIED follow-up.'
3:::It was ascertained that 117 (47.6%) of 246 patients with pacemakers had a programming error. Forty-three (36.8%) of 117 patients were symptomatic, and after reprogramming, all symptoms diminished partially or completely during the follow-up. Moreover, 30 (25.6%) of 117 patients with ICDs had a programming error. Furthermore, 6 (15%) of 40 patients with CRT-Ds had a programming error. To conclude, when all patients with CIEDs were assessed together, it was ascertained that 153 (38%) of 403 patients had programming errors.
3:::The latest and worldwide largest study on the genetics of schizophrenia found 128 genome wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and 108 genome wide loci. The most obvious association is with genetic variations in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Besides polymorphisms, structural variants in the form of copy number variants (CNV), such as microdeletions and microduplications have a very high impact in a subgroup of patients. These CNVs are mainly microdeletions on 1q21.1, 2p16.3, 3q29, 15q13.3 and 16p11.2 as well as a large deletion on 22q11.21 and a microduplication on 16p11.2.
4:::Pregnancy rates and discussions were related to functional levels. As 20% of women with CP surveyed experienced pregnancy, there is a need to increase awareness, education, support, and advocacy for achievement of optimal reproductive health. More research is needed to identify factors contributing to maternal and infant health in women with CP.
2:::Review and synthesis of selected recent reports of stem/progenitor cell-based approaches for retinal disease, with interpretation and perspective.
3:::Under electron microscopy, variant pathologic changes of vessels were found in all patients with EC. In the tunicae intima, we found vacuolization, apoptosis, necrosis, and intralumenal protrusion of endothelial cells, as well as swollen basement and highly flexed and discontinued elastic plate. In the tunicae media, vacuolization and swollen mitochondria were found in muscular cells. In the tunicae adventitia, extravascular erythrocytes, edema or apoptosis of pericytes, collagen predominance, and inflammatory cell infiltration and destruction were found. Neuron denature and necrosis were found in the peripheral brain tissue. In the microvascular structure of 5 glioma specimens, we found enlargement and hyperplasia of endothelial cells, swollen basement membrane, swollen pericytes, and astrocytic hyperplasia and neuron denature in adjacent brain tissues.
4:::In this article, we have described a workflow for the integration of high-resolution in vivo ultra-high field templates into the surgical navigation system as a means to assist with DBS planning. The method does not require any additional cost or time to the patient. Future work will include prospectively evaluating different templates and their impact on target selection.
2:::All AAA screening ultrasound examinations performed in the Massachusetts General Hospital radiology department in the 15 months before and after the new guidelines were retrospectively reviewed to assess changes in examination volume and appropriateness, demographics, aneurysm detection rate and size at diagnosis, frequency and type of incidental findings, and radiologist recommendations. Examinations were considered ""definitely appropriate"" if meeting USPSTF grade ""B"" evidence and ""possibly appropriate"" if meeting grade ""C"" or ""I"" evidence, based on available guidelines. Means were compared with the t test.
3:::Out of 120,914 subjects with a positive first time C(13)-UBT, 50,836 (42.0%) underwent a second C(13)-UBT test. After excluding former smokers, 48,130 remained who were eligible for analysis. The mean age was 44.3±18.2years, 69.2% were females, 87.8% were Jewish and 12.2% Arabs, 25.5% were current smokers. The overall eradication failure rates were 33.3%: 34.8% in current smokers and 32.8% in subjects who never smoked. In a multivariate analysis, eradication failure was positively associated with current smoking (Odds Ratio {OR} 1.15, 95% CI 1.10-1.20, p<0.001), female gender (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.14-1.25, p<0.001) and a low socioeconomic status (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.17-1.31, p<0.001).
2:::We conducted an analysis of the Michigan Trauma Quality Improvement Program data from January 2012 to December 2014. The data set contains information on date, time, and drug type of the first dose of VTE prophylaxis. Thirty-seven thousand eight hundred sixty-eight patients from 23 hospitals were present with an Injury Severity Score of 5 or greater and hospitalization for more than 24 hours. Patients were excluded if they died within 24 hours or received no pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis or agents other than UFH or LMWH while admitted to the hospital. We compared patients receiving LMWH to those receiving UFH. Outcomes assessed were VTE event, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and mortality during hospitalization. We used a generalized estimating equation approach to fit population-averaged logistic regression models with the type of first dose of VTE prophylaxis as the independent variable. Unfractionated heparin was considered the reference value. Timing of the first dose of VTE prophylaxis was entered into the model in addition to standard covariates. Odds ratios were generated for each of the dependent variables of interest.
3:::We collected data from 10 centers of patients who presented with CDAD requiring surgery between July 1, 2010 and July 30, 2014. Two patients died during the surgical procedure, leaving 98 individuals in the study. The overall mortality was 32%, and 75% had postoperative complications. Median age was 64.5 years; 59% were male. Concerning preoperative patient conditions, 54% were on pressors, 47% had renal failure, and 36% had respiratory failure. When comparing TC and LI, there was no statistical difference regarding these conditions. Univariate preprocedure predictors of mortality were age, lactate, timing of operation, vasopressor use, and acute renal failure. There was no statistical difference between the APACHE score of patients undergoing either procedure (TC, 22 vs LI, 16). Adjusted mortality (controlled for preprocedure confounders) was significantly lower in the LI group (17.2% vs 39.7%; p = 0.002).
4:::This is the first multicenter study comparing TC with LI for the treatment of CDAD. In this study, LI carried less mortality than TC. In patients without contraindications, LI should be considered for the surgical treatment of CDAD.
2:::Ps-DOX-CA4P were prepared by solvent evaporation method using mPEG-b-PLA as carriers. The potential capability of CA4P to reverse DOX resistance was verified by cytotoxicity test, apoptosis assay and cellular uptake of DOX. The comparison between free drugs and drug-loaded polymersomes was also made on a single-layer cell model and multicellular tumour spheroids to display the superiority of the drug vehicles. Furthermore, we put the emphasis on the investigation into underlying mechanisms for CA4P overcoming DOX resistance.
3:::Depth judgements were 6·2 times as precise at 1 m and 3·0 times as precise at 3 m using 3D versus 2D displays (P < 0·001). Participants performed all laparoscopic tasks faster in 3D at both 1 and 3 m (P < 0.001), with mean completion times up to 64 per cent shorter for 3D versus 2D displays. Workload was lower for 3D displays (up to 34 per cent) than for 2D displays at both viewing distances (P < 0·001). Greater viewing distance inhibited performance for two laparoscopic tasks, and increased perceived workload for all three (P < 0·001). Higher stereoacuity was associated with shorter completion times for the navigating in space task performed in 3D at 1 m (r = - 0·40, P = 0·001).

2:::We prospectively included 33 patients who underwent arthroscopic hip surgery (34 hips). For all patients, radiographs and severity of pain were evaluated preoperatively. During arthroscopy, we classified the chondral injury and synovitis, noted the incidence of labral tear and its instability, and a sample of the synovial membrane was harvested for quantitative PCR to determine levels of TNFα, IL1β, IL6, ADAMTS4, MMP1, and MMP3. The relationships between the levels of these cytokines, severity of hip pain, and the pathological findings during arthroscopy were examined.
3:::Dose-dependent increases in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximum plasma concentration with AAFP were observed in both studies. The AAFP 500-mg bioavailability relative to OAA 1000 mg measured by the geometric mean ratio for area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration was 93.4% (90% confidence interval 85.3-102.4), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity was 91.0% (90% confidence interval 83.3-99.4), and maximum plasma concentration was 99.8% (90% confidence interval 86.3-115.5). Dose proportionality was seen across all AAFP dose levels (100-625 mg). Abiraterone acetate fine particle was found to be safe and well tolerated in this study.
3:::Seven of the 15 patients had a clinically significant fluid collection, and 5 of these patients were treated with percutaneous drain placement or exploratory laparotomy. The other patients had a phlegmon or a clinically insignificant fluid collection and were discharged home within 48 h.
2:::A prospective study was conducted in a tertiary centre. Clinical indications, clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction were assessed in patients treated with flexible carbon dioxide laser surgery via transnasal endoscopy and followed up over a period of up to nine months. Patients who were not fit for general anaesthesia or those with lesions that cannot be accessed by micro-laryngoscopy were included.

4:::Our study provides-for the first time to our knowledge-evidence that restarting adjuvant hormone therapy is associated with better breast cancer outcomes. Clinicians now have further evidence to encourage patients to restart their treatment after discontinuation of adjuvant hormone therapy.
3:::Given only an inspiratory CT scan, measuring tracheal shape provides complementary information only to emphysema measurements. The best performing set in the inspiratory setting was a combination of emphysema and bronchial measurements. The best performing feature set in the inspiratory-expiratory setting includes measurements of emphysema, ventilation, air trapping, and trachea. Inspiratory and inspiratory-expiratory settings showed similar performance.
2:::Adult patients transferred to our ACS-verified Level I trauma center from any NTC between May and December 2012 were enrolled prospectively. Available CT images from NTCs were reviewed in a blinded fashion by our facilitys trauma radiologist; his interpretations were compared with those from the NTC. Interpretations of the trauma centers (TCs) images were compared with the NTC interpretations. Means and proportions were used to summarize the data.'
3:::Although no group differences were found, disorganisation and manic symptoms correlated with situation attributions and self-blame when such attributions were unsupported by the available evidence, and depression and anxiety correlated with other-person and self attributions (not situation attributions) when confirmed by the available evidence, regardless of diagnosis.
4:::There was limited use of broad-spectrum agents such as carbapenems or third-generation cephalosporins. In this region with low methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus prevalence, empiric vancomycin use was common, selected for activity against coagulase-negative staphylococci. Empiric vancomycin is rarely necessary because coagulase-negative staphylococci are often contaminants and sepsis is rarely fulminant, occurring almost exclusively in extremely low birthweight infants. Implementation of appropriate, local antimicrobial policies is crucial to minimise antimicrobial exposure in this vulnerable population and halt the development of antimicrobial resistance.
2:::High payload itraconazole-incorporated lipid nanoparticles were prepared by hot high-pressure homogenization method using tristearin (TS) as a solid lipid, triolein (TO) as a liquid lipid and egg phosphatidylcholine/Tween 80/DSPE-PEG2000 as a surfactants mixture. To investigate the effects of liquid lipid in lipid core on itraconazole (ITZ) dissolution and release, TS/TO ratio was varied as 100/0, 90/10 and 80/20 (mg/mg).
3:::The Fluorogenic derivatization technique can easily be adapted to a 96-well plate, in which several protein formulations can be screened in short time. Representatively for hGH, we show that the formation of benzoxazole parallels the oxidation of Met to methionine sulfoxide which enables estimation of Met oxidation by just recording the fluorescence.
2:::We examined 200 healthy volunteers with an Agatston score of 0 and a normal, high quality coronary CTA. Using 320 slice multidetector row CT and designated vessel tracing software with border detection algorithm, the main coronary arteries and branches were delineated and total and segmental dimensions calculated.
4:::Although this model still does not embody perfect reproducibility, it proved sufficiently practical for use in surgical training.
3:::The DVR ranged from 1.3 to 2.5 across brain regions with a TRV of 0-7%, and did not demonstrate a systematic difference between test and retest. The ICCs ranged from 0.2 to 0.9. DVR estimates were stable after 40 min.
2:::Seventy-eight patients who underwent medial APM and 38 healthy controls underwent a 3-dimensional motion analysis during barefoot overground jogging at baseline. Sixty-four patients who underwent APM and 23 controls returned at follow-up. External peak moments (flexion and adduction) and the peak knee flexion angle during stance were evaluated for the APM leg, non-APM leg (nonoperated leg), and control leg.
3:::Sixty-eight pregnancies were identified, and four women (5.9%) experienced a loss during the pregnancy. Among the remaining 64 pregnancies, the average gestational age at delivery was 36.9 weeks, growth restriction was present in 12 (17.5%), and major anomalies were present in 51 (75.0%). Delivery was undertaken for non-reassuring fetal surveillance in 35.9% of the pregnancies; 93% of which represented a change from prior reassuring surveillance and 52.6% of which demonstrated histopathologic evidence of placental insufficiency. None among increased maternal age, the presence of an anomaly, or growth restriction were significantly more common in the group with non-reassuring surveillance.

4:::Simultaneous cardiac PET/MRI is feasible in the evaluation of cardiac sarcoidosis and myocarditis achieving diagnostic image quality.
3:::A total of 6600 valid pressure readings were obtained from 60 patients, including 3000 beat data and 3600 pulse wave data, respectively. The mean differences in wrist CNAP versus IAP for beat data were as follows: systolic arterial pressure (SAP): -2.09±5.39 mmHg; mean arterial pressure (MAP): 0.27±3.64 mmHg; diastolic arterial pressure (DAP): and 2.63±6.44 mmHg. For pulse wave data, the mean difference (SD) values were as follows: SAP: -2.06±6.51 mmHg; MAP: 0.50±4.36 mmHg; and DAP: 3.06±6.81 mmHg. Percentage errors were less than 28.3%. Levels of agreements were detected to be -12.65-8.47 for SAP, -6.86-7.40 for MAP, and -9.99-15.26 for DAP.
2:::Patients newly initiating CANA, DAPA, GLP-1s, or DPP-4s from February 1, 2014-June 30, 2014 were identified from the QuintilesIMS PharMetrics Plus Database. The first fill defined the index date/drug. Patients were required to have a T2DM diagnosis (ICD-9-CM 250.x[0,2]) and ≥12 months of continuous enrollment pre- and post-index (follow-up). Main outcome measures were adherence (proportion of days covered, PDC; medication possession ratio, MPR) and persistence on index therapy. PDC or MPR ≥0.80 was considered adherent. Patients were considered persistent until evidence of discontinuation (gap ≥90 days between two subsequent index therapy prescriptions). Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis assessed time to discontinuation, while a Cox proportional hazards model (PHM) evaluated risk of discontinuation. Logistic regression models evaluated the likelihood of non-adherence.
3:::A total of 181030 patients with non-metastatic, surgically treated breast cancer were identified in the period from 2010 to 2013. For overall and cancer-specific survival assessment according to the bioscore system, P values for pairwise comparisons among different score points were significant (P < 0.0001) except for the comparison between score 0 and score 1. For cancer-specific survival assessment according to the AJCC stages, P values for pairwise comparisons among different stages were significant (P < 0.0001) except for the comparison between stages IIIB and IIIC. For overall survival assessment according to the AJCC stages, P values for pairwise comparisons among different stages were significant (P < 0.001) except for the comparison between stages IA and IB. In a multivariate analysis, the following factors were associated with better cancer-specific survival (earlier stage disease, ER positivity, PR positivity, Her2 neu positivity, and nuclear grade) (P < 0.0001).
2:::A prospectively maintained database was reviewed. Patient and tumor characteristics, survival, and rate of CBC were compared in women age ≤40 years treated for unilateral Stage 1-3 BC from January 2000 through December 2013.
4:::The present findings provide evidence that perceptions of weight stigma are critical in understanding the impact of weight-based discrimination. Additionally, these results have theoretical and practical implications for both understanding and addressing the psychological and physical consequences of weight-based stigma.
3:::Based on the micro-CT images, 12 (60%) roots presented dentinal microcracks in the apical region. The images generated by the OCT systems were able to show microcrack lines at the same location as the corresponding micro-CT cross sections. Although the diagnostic performance of the SD-OCT device was superior, there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 OCT devices (P > .05). Interexaminer agreement was substantial to almost perfect for the SD-OCT system and moderate to almost perfect for the swept-source OCT system, whereas intraexaminer agreement was substantial to almost perfect for both OCT devices.
2:::In the INTREPID (HIV-infected patieNts and TREatment with PItavastatin vs pravastatin for Dyslipidemia) randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 4 trial (INTREPID, we recruited adults aged 18-70 years with controlled HIV (with CD4 counts >200 cells per μL and HIV-1 RNA <200 copies per mL) on antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months and dyslipidaemia (LDL cholesterol 3·4-5·7 mmol/L and triglycerides ≤4·5 mmol/L) from 45 sites in the USA and Puerto Rico. Patients being treated with darunavir, or who had homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or any condition causing secondary dyslipidaemia, or a history of statin intolerance, diabetes, or coronary artery disease were not eligible. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to pitavastatin 4 mg or pravastatin 40 mg with matching placebos once daily orally for 12 weeks, followed by a 40 week safety extension. Randomisation was stratified by viral hepatitis B or C coinfection and computer-generated. Investigators, patients, study staff, and those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment group. The primary endpoint was percentage change in fasting serum LDL cholesterol from baseline to week 12 and the primary efficacy analysis was done in the modified intention-to-treat population. The safety analysis included all patients who took at least one dose of study medication. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01301066.
3:::Male teenagers had greater blood levels of lead and mercury, but sex had no association with blood cadmium level. There were age-related increases in blood cadmium, but blood lead decreased with age, and age had little association with blood mercury. The concentrations of cadmium and mercury declined from 2010 to 2013. The blood concentrations of lead, cadmium, and mercury in teenagers were positively associated with the levels in their parents after adjustment for covariates.
2:::This cross-sectional analysis included 3514 participants, aged 65 years or older, who participated in baseline health assessment for the Korean Urban Rural Elderly cohort study from 2012 to 2015. HDL cholesterol concentration was analyzed using both continuous and categorical variables. Functional state was assessed by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), activities of daily living (ADL) scale, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scale, timed up-and go (TUG) test, and chair-rise test (CRT). Multiple logistic regression models were used to investigate independent association between HDL cholesterol and functional state, after adjusting for sex, age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, lipid-lowering drug, history of cancer and cardiovascular disease, and health behaviors.
4:::When using a working trocar and live images, endoscopic HD camera imaging accounted for significantly more reliable identifications of anatomical structures compared to the microscopic view. The subjective impression of video quality is significantly better with HD-optics. The goal of further studies should be to evalute if these findings results in improved surgical outcome.
3:::Findings revealed 3 distinct solutions with varying sensitivity and specificity for identifying adolescents who reported suicide ideation. Sensitivity of the classification trees ranged from 44.6% to 77.6%. The tree with greatest specificity and lowest sensitivity was based on a history of suicide ideation. The tree with moderate sensitivity and high specificity was based on depressive symptoms, suicide attempts or suicide among family and friends, and social support. The most sensitive but least specific tree utilized these factors and gender, ethnicity, hours of sleep, school-related factors, and future orientation.
4:::Physicians should have high suspicion for dementia and delirium in older patients admitted for burn injuries. Dementia and delirium are associated with morbidity in older patients with burn injuries.
3:::Among females (N = 10,162, age: 48 ± 16), c-statistics for the composite chronic disease end point were 0.746 (0.725, 0.767) for the derivation group and 0.717 (0.682, 0.753) for the validation group, whereas males (N = 4615, age: 48 ± 15) had 0.755 (0.727, 0.783) and 0.742 (0.702, 0.782). In the validation group, MHIRS strata of low-, moderate-, and high-risk categories had hazard ratios (HR) for any 3-year chronic disease diagnosis among females of HR = 3.42 for moderate vs low and HR = 9.75 for high vs low, whereas males had HR = 4.80 and HR = 10.68, respectively (all p < 0.0001).
1:::The purpose of this study was to determine whether Menieres disease (MD) produces endolymphatic cavity size changes that are detectable using unenhanced high-resolution T2-weighted MRI.'
2:::Selected portal vein branches were occluded using gelfoam powder (temporary portal vein embolization) or embospheres (permanent portal vein embolization), n = 5/group. Magnetic resonance volumetry and angiography were used to determine volumes of the liver lobe and portal vein branch recanalization. In order to assess the functional and regenerative capacity of occluded liver lobes, nonoccluded lobes were resected 14 days (timespan of complete portal vein recanalization) after temporary portal vein embolization or permanent portal vein embolization. Subsequently, RNA sequencing was performed to compare the signaling pathways of early liver regeneration among the groups.
3:::The response rate was 92.97% (n=3835). Additionally, we obtained valid questionnaires from 3004 individuals. Of these, 25.77% reported experiencing physical violence, 63.65% non-physical violence, 2.76% sexual harassment, and 11.72% organized healthcare disturbances. A logistic regression analysis revealed that nurses who have less experience, work a rotating roster, work in emergency rooms and pediatrics departments, have low empathy levels, and who work in poor nursing environments have greater odds of experiencing violence.
2:::An invitation to a web-based survey was sent to 85 Dutch stroke neurologists in different hospitals, with questions about importance, timing, and medical management of spontaneous anticoagulation-related intracerebral hemorrhage.
4:::A criticism of traditional external fixation is the inability of longitudinal ligamentotaxis to attain sagittal plane (volar tilt) reduction of the articular surface. This study demonstrates that a multiplanar reduction technique using unilateral external fixation devices on cadaveric distal radius fractures can achieve an acceptable reduction.
3:::The demographic and operative data were similar between the 2 groups. The incidence of hypoxemia was greater in the non-AOI than the AOI group (18% vs 0%; P = .009). ΔPaO2 (the difference in partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood between OLV 45 and 15 minutes) was smaller in the AOI than the non-AOI group (-29 mm Hg vs -69 mm Hg; P = .005). Duration of surgery and incidence of complications did not vary between groups.
2:::We retrospectively reviewed OS outcomes for 593 patients diagnosed with AOC for 77 months at a regional cancer centre. Patients were stratified into five progressively overlapping categories based on treatment received - Primary debulking surgery (PDS), PDS or Interval debulking (IDS), all surgery and those considered for IDS, patients receiving any treatment and total patient cohort. A systematic search of literature was performed.
3:::Severe insomnia was observed in 335(54%) patients with a current MDE, of whom 234(70%) were women; 49(8%) patients had HTG, of whom 25(51%) were women. 69(11%) patients were treated with lipid-lowering drugs. Severe insomnia was associated with a higher frequency of HTG in the whole sample (9.9% vs 5.6%, p=0.046) and in the subgroup of women (9.0% vs 2.0%, p=0.002). Multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, education levels, BMI and total HDRS scores confirmed the association between severe insomnia and HTG in the whole sample (OR=2.02, 95%CI [1.00-4.08], p=0.05) as well as in the subgroup of women (OR=4.82, 95%CI [1.5-15.5], p=0.008). No association was shown in men.
4:::EMG-force relationships were elucidated for three neck areas, and provided models allow inferences to be drawn from EMG to force on a group level. Reliability of EMG-force relationship models was higher within than between days, but typically acceptable for all but the lowest contraction intensities, and enables adjustment for measurement imprecision in future studies.
3:::The crude prevalence of self-reported stroke was 5.04% (156 of 3098, 95% confidence interval: 4.29%-5.87%) for non-Indigenous Australians and 8.75% (152 of 1738, 95% confidence interval: 7.46%-10.17%) for Indigenous Australians (P < .0001). The age-adjusted prevalence of self-reported stroke for non-Indigenous and Indigenous Australians was 4.23% and 12.72%, respectively. The prevalence of stroke increased significantly with age for both Indigenous (odds ratio = 1.06 per year, P ≤ .001) and non-Indigenous Australians (odds ratio = 1.04 per year, P ≤ .001), with the Indigenous prevalence being higher than that of the non-Indigenous group at every age.
2:::Stenosis was assessed in 18 carotid arteries of 14 patients, and the effective Z values of noncalcified carotid plaques were compared with the signal intensities of magnetic resonance angiography.
3:::Overall, 107 surgeons participated, of whom 90 were men. Initial estimated risks mirrored actual vignette risks: 10.4% ± 9.9 for low risk, 17.6% ± 13.2 for average risk, and 21.0% ± 14.7 for high risk (p < 0.001). After SP videos were viewed and final risk estimates were rendered, there was a significant difference between male and female physicians in the absolute change in estimated risk (p = 0.002), with male physicians having larger changes than female physicians. There was also an effect of SP gender that varied by vignette type (p < 0.001). Increasing video importance scores were directly associated with increasing change in risk scores for average-risk and high-risk vignette/video combinations (p < 0.001 for each).
2:::A retrospective study was conducted of 494 patients with clinical stage IA lung cancer who had peripherally located lung adenocarcinoma. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to compare the ability to predict tumor invasiveness and recurrence between m-CT value, consolidation/tumor ratio, and tumor size. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the independent variables for the prediction of pathologic, less invasive lung cancer. Disease-free survival was measured from the date of the operation until any recurrence.
4:::The evaluation of m-CT value is useful in predicting less invasive lung cancer. The m-CT value can potentially determine operative procedure, particularly limited resection for peripheral lung adenocarcinoma.
3:::A total of 1271 patients with CD were analyzed. During the follow-up period of 10,188 patient-years (median 7.1 yrs), 361 patients (28.4%) underwent CD-related surgery. Age at diagnosis, jejunal involvement, initial disease behavior, and perianal disease at diagnosis were associated with a poor prognosis and included in the KCDP model, which showed a modest discrimination ability with a Harrels c-index of 0.731 at 5 years, and was well calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ = 8.230, P = 0.511).'
2:::We performed a retrospective chart review of 271 patients with ALS using either PS or VAPS, along with an evaluation of device-recorded data to explore differences in attainment of goal tidal volumes (Vt) and ratio of respiratory rate to tidal volume (f/Vt), in addition to triggering and cycling ability.
4:::Examination of device data for exhaled tidal volumes and f/Vt may be of use in evaluating efficacy of NIV in ALS. VAPS provides more reliable goal Vt than does PS, and is associated with decreased f/Vt. Spontaneous cycling is decreased in ALS despite preservation of triggering ability. Although a set backup rate may address decreased triggering, perhaps more importantly, setting a sufficient fixed inspiratory time would address the issue of decreased cycling.
3:::The prognostic significance of clinical and gene variables varied according to the molecular subtype. Univariate analysis showed that positive lymph node status was significantly correlated with the increased risk of distant metastasis in all subtypes except the hormone receptor-negative, HER2-positive (HR-/HER2+) subtype. Most p-genes were significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with the HR+/HER2- subtype, whereas i-genes correlated with a favorable outcome in patients with HR-/HER2+ breast cancer. In HR-/HER2+ breast cancer, four genes (three i-genes BTN3A2, CD2, and TRBC1 and the p-gene MMP11) were significantly associated with distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). A new prognostic model for HR-/HER2+ breast cancer based on the expression of MMP11 and CD2 was developed and the DMFS for patients in the high-risk group according to our model was significantly lower than that for those in the low-risk group. Multivariate analyses revealed that our risk score is an independent prognostic factor for DMFS. Moreover, C-index showed that our risk score has a superior prognostic performance to traditional clinicopathological factors.
2:::CWHSP participants with a final determination of PMF during 1 January 2000-1 October 2016 with at least one prior radiograph in the system were included. We characterised demographics, participation and progression patterns.
3:::Patients (N = 155,720) were divided into elderly (n = 10,232; 6.57%) and general adult (n = 145,488; 93.4%) populations. Mean length of stay was longer in elderly patients versus general adult patients (3.62 days vs. 3.11 days; P < 0.0001). In-hospital mortality was more common in elderly patients versus general adult patients (0.31% vs. 0.06%; P < 0.0001). In-hospital and 30-day complications were more common in elderly patients versus general adult patients (11.3% vs. 7.15% and 17.8% vs. 12.6%; P < 0.0001). Nonroutine discharge was more common in elderly patients versus general adult patients (33.7% vs. 16.2%; P < 0.0001).
4:::Extensive resections of insular gliomas can be achieved with low morbidity and can improve overall survival and PFS. In this series of LGGs, EOR was associated with longer malignant PFS, and 1p/19q codeletion was predictive of PFS.
1:::To report clinical outcomes in patients with borderline dysplasia undergoing an arthroscopic technique of labral seal restoration with minimal acetabular rim resection and capsular plication.
2:::Between December 2005 and November 2010, 244 revascularized CAD patients with nonsleepy OSA (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥15/h, Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score<10) were randomly assigned to CPAP or no-CPAP. Echocardiographic measurements were obtained at baseline, and after 3 and 12months.
3:::The average age of the group was 56.63 years with a mean ejection fraction 20.8%. Before implantation, mean BAI and BDI scores indicated mild depression and anxiety. Following LVAD implantation, average scores for both BDI-II and BAI decreased significantly, indicating minimal depression and anxiety (12.6-8.54, p = 0.001 and 12.06-6.6, p < 0.001, respectively). Mean scores were significantly lowered in 11 and 8 of the 21 subdomains tested by the BAI and BDI, respectively. Significant improvements were noted in post-LVAD B-type natriuretic peptide, serum sodium, and blood urea nitrogen.
4:::There is dissociation between acute symptomatic benefit after a course of accelerated HF-rTMS applied to the lDLPFC in treatment resistant MDD and performance on tests of decision making and impulse control. Though rTMS appears cognitively safe, additional research is warranted to understand this potential dissociation and its putative clinical implications.
2:::We conducted a descriptive qualitative study of ICU survivors from medical ICUs in three separate hospitals with a positive screening result on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Semistructured interviews were conducted 3 months after hospital discharge of patients. Patients were also allowed to nominate up to two friends or family members for enrollment to provide additional perspective on the patients experience.'
3:::We enrolled 50 patients and 22 of their friends and/or family members. The average APACHE II score was 23, 80% of patients were male, and the average age was 50 years; 70% of patients and 77% of friends/family members completed the semistructured interview 3 months after hospital discharge. We identified three domains that could inform an alcohol-specific intervention, each with multiple themes: motivation with complications (anxiety and depression, critical illness as a catalyst, delirium and cognitive impairment); therapeutic alliance (autonomy, failure and opportunities to build a therapeutic alliance); and the return to the home milieu (lack of screening for depression and anxiety, social network support for drinking, social isolation, social network support for abstinence, lack of available and affordable treatment, and negative experiences with Alcoholics Anonymous).
4:::When appropriate NDBs were used, the diagnostic performance of (201)Tl IQ-SPECT was comparable with that of the conventional system regardless of different characteristics of myocardial accumulation in the conventional system.
2:::Meta-analyses were performed between 2 polymorphisms in TAP1 (TAP1-333, -637) and 3 polymorphisms in TAP2 (TAP2-379, -565, and -665) and AS.
3:::The meta-analyses were involved with 6 studies with 415 cases and 659 controls. Significant association was found between TAP1-333Val, TAP1-637Gly, and TAP2-565Thr and AS compared with combined control group (TAP1-333Val: p = 0.009, OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.09-1.80; TAP1-637Gly: p = 0.002, OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.15-1.91; p = 0.03, OR = 1.38, 95% CI 1.04-1.84). Subgroup analysis shown that significant association was only found in AS when compared with HLA-B27-negative controls (TAP1-333Val: p = 0.004, OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.14-2.06; TAP1-637Gly: p = 0.004, OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.15-2.02; p = 0.02, OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.09-2.24), but not in AS when compared with HLA-B27-positive controls (p > 0.05). Moreover, no significant associations were found between haplotypes in TAP1 and TAP2 in both the combined and the subgroup analyses (p > 0.05).
4:::Study findings reveal that the perinatal care system is not set up with women with physical disabilities in mind and that barriers to perinatal care may contribute to poor outcomes. More research and training are needed to address barriers to perinatal care for women with physical disabilities. Collaboration among perinatal and disability-related providers and meaningful inclusion of women with physical disabilities in educational initiatives and care plans are vital to improve care experiences and outcomes.
2:::A direct anterior submandibular retropharyangeal approach with open reduction and fixation (ORIF) using a customized variable screw placement (VSP) plate was used to realign and fix the fracture fragments in compression mode under direct vision. Twenty patients of type-II odontoid fractures (unsuitable for anterior odontoid screw) underwent an anterior retropharyngeal approach with anterior variable screw position (VSP) plate and screw fixation and eight amongst them, who had associated atlantoaxial instability underwent additional bilateral anterior transarticular screws.
3:::All patients treated by this technique had 100% fracture site bone union without any implant failure. Longest follow-up has been for 3 years.
1:::To share the surgical technique that possesses the advantage of a perioperative ureteroscope without position change, which allows for a laparoscopic segmental resection of the ureteral stricture to be performed more precisely.
3:::There were statistically significant group differences in Co-Gn, B-VRL, U1-PP, U1-VRL, Ls-VRL, with significant increases in these parameters in the elastics group (P < .05). The mandibular incisors were protruded in the monobloc group (5.45 ± 1.23°), whereas they were retruded in the elastics group (-3.01 ± 1.66°; P < .01).
4:::We highly recommend immunohistochemistry for clinically susceptible, nonactive chronic gastritis cases, if the conventional stain-based HP detection is negative. Moreover, we recommend to use IHC more widely as basic HP stain. Helicobacter pylori FISH technique is primarily recommended to determine bacterial clarithromycin resistance. Furthermore, it is another accurate diagnostic tool for HP.
2:::The study included 58 allo-HSCT recipients from the University Hospital of Cologne detected BKPyV positive by real-time PCR between 2009 and 2015. For correlative analysis, the first detected BKPyV-DNA load in urine and in plasma as well as the onset and severity of HC following the first day of conditioning regimen was considered. Phylogenetic analysis of BKPyV isolates was performed.
3:::A total of 95,057 AOM users were identified (91% women; mean age 68). One-year cessation was 51% overall, highest for strontium ranelate (68%), and lowest for denosumab (28%). Cessation probability was higher in men (14% to 2.1-fold), smokers (>6%), and patients with missing BMI (19-28%) or smoking (6-20%) data, and overweight/obese/underweight (7% to 2.6-fold increase compared to normal weight). Patients aged 60-79 years, with a recent fracture or other drugs used for osteoporosis, had better persistence.
4:::Paeonol protected against TNF-α-induced proliferation and cytokine release of FLS by decreasing the expression of miR-155 and upregulating its target FOXO3.
2:::Digital retinal images taken at age ∼73 years from 683 participants of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) were analysed with Singapore I Vessel Assessment (SIVA) software. Multiple regression models were applied to determine cross-sectional associations between retinal vascular parameters and general cognitive ability (g), memory, processing speed, visuospatial ability, crystallised cognitive ability and change in IQ from childhood to older age.
3:::Twenty-three patients (14 males and 9 females) presented with CPA hemangioblastomas. Eight patients (34.8%) had von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome. Gross total resection was achieved in 22 patients (95.6%). The mean follow-up was 45.1 ± 36.2 months (range 3-144 months). After surgery, the symptoms improved in 18 cases (78.3%), remained unchanged in 3 cases (13%), and were aggravated in 2 cases (8.7%). Four patients showed local recurrence during follow-up (17.4%). Patients with cystic hemangioblastomas had a better neurologic improvement (P = 0.041) compared with patients with solid tumors. Furthermore, patients with maximal diameter of tumors >3 cm (P = 0.035) or solid tumors (P = 0.018) showed a higher incidence of postoperative complications. The local recurrence was correlated with VHL disease (P = 0.027).
4:::The SUVmax of quantitative bone SPECT/CT was highly correlated with traditional imaging parameters for medial compartment OA severity of the knee. Quantitative bone SPECT/CT is a promising imaging technique for the objective assessment of knee OA.
3:::The prevalence of CM in subjects was significantly higher than in controls (34.6% and 22.2%, p=.014). Profound immunodepression (maternal CD4 cell count <200 cell/mm(3)) was significantly associated with CM (p=.006). The major predictors of CM in subjects were maternal CD4 cell count <200 cell/mm(3) and placental malaria while in controls placental malaria was the only predictor.
2:::Fifty-one patients were identified who underwent single-stage Symes ankle disarticulation amputation with excision of the lateral and medial malleoli by a single surgeon during a 23-year period. None of these patients had sufficient tissue to allow amputation at the transmetatarsal or tarsometatarsal levels. Thirty-three underwent amputation due to a diabetic forefoot infection, 11 secondary to a crush injury, 3 for a nondiabetic infection, 3 for a noncorrectable acquired deformity, and 1 for neoplasm. The average age at surgery for the diabetic patients was 62.1 years (range, 36-81 years), with an average follow-up of 6.8 years (range, 4.0-11.6 years). The nondiabetic patients had an average age of 37.8 years (range, 21-65 years), with an average follow-up of 9.3 years (range, 2.2-25.0 years). Patients who were alive and could be contacted were invited to complete the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) questionnaire that was scored for functional, mobility, and bothersome indices.'
3:::Ten studies were included from the United States of America (n = 4), Canada (n = 1), France (n = 2), Italy (n = 1), Japan (n = 1) and China (n = 1). The prevalence of NAFLD (Imaging studies), NASH and fibrosis (biopsied populations) were 35% [95% confidence interval (CI) 29-42], 42% (95% CI 22-64) and 22% (95% CI 13-34), respectively. Meta-analysis of risk factors showed that high BMI, waist circumference, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, triglycerides and high CD4 cell count were associated with NAFLD, whereas HIV viral load, duration of HIV infection, duration of antiretroviral therapy and CD4 cell count nadir were not. Patients with high BMI [mean difference (MD) 1.38, 95% CI 0.04-2.71 P = 0.04], fasting glucose (MD 0.80, 95% CI 0.47-1.13 P < 0.00001) and AST level (MD 13.00, 95% CI 4.34-21.65 P = 0.003) were at increased risk of significant liver fibrosis.
4:::Adding quantitative information to a decision aid increased uptake of colorectal cancer screening, while adding a nudge to undergo FIT did not increase uptake. Further research on quantitative information in decision aids is warranted.
2:::Cross-sectional study in 2013.
3:::Under the influence of IL-12, hPDL cells expressed significantly higher levels of RANKL. Expression was mediated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 and NF-κB signaling pathways. Conditioned medium of IL-12-incubated cells proved to contain molecule(s) that induced RANKL expression. Addition of suramin (G protein-coupled receptor inhibitor) and ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (calcium chelator) suggested existence of intermediate molecule(s) that could activate heterotrimeric G protein signaling in a calcium-dependent pathway.
4:::This study demonstrates for the first time that in oestrogen-deprived postmenopausal women, ghrelin administration affects neither FSH nor LH levels but stimulates PRL secretion, that is amplified by exogenous oestrogen administration.
2:::To optimize biochemical parameters of irinotecan and its metabolites in the PBPK modeling, a Cluster Newton method was introduced. In the VCS, virtual patients were generated considering the inter-individual variability and genetic polymorphisms of enzymes and transporters.
3:::Sixteen trials were included in the meta-analysis. Significant combined effects of non-pharmacological therapies were observed in reducing frequency and severity of HFs after treatment (d = -0.57, P < 0.001). These effects were sustained, albeit reduced in part, during follow-up (d = -0.36, P < 0.001), with the exception of frequency (P = 0.41). Meta-analysis according to therapy types showed that for hypnosis, HFs scores instead of scores of HFs-related daily interference scale (HFRDIS) were significantly lowered at the post-treatment time point (d = -13.19, P < 0.001); for acupuncture, a small but significant effect on HFRDIS was found at the post-treatment time point (d = -3.34, P < 0.001). The effect was sustained during follow-up; however, no effect was evident for HFs frequency; for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), at the post-treatment time point, but not during follow-up, a small but significant effect was documented for HFs score (d = -0.88, P < 0.01). No serious adverse effect was reported in the included studies.
4:::This meta-analysis strongly suggests that minoxidil, finasteride, and low-level laser light therapy are effective for promoting hair growth in men with androgenetic alopecia and that minoxidil is effective in women with androgenetic alopecia.
2:::The methods were carried out using a Kinetex HILIC column for polar compounds at 30°C. Mobile phase with isocratic condition of acetonitrile: 13mM ammonium acetate pH 6.0: methanol (55:35:10 v/v/v) at 0.8mL/min flow rate was used.
3:::The infarct size was reduced in colchicine treated mice (39.8±3.5% versus 52.9±3.2%, p<0.05). Troponin was significantly lower in the colchicine treated mice (7015.7±1423.7pg/mL, n=5 vs 30,723.7±7959.9pg/mL in the placebo group, n=6; p<0.0001). Fibrosis was decreased in the Colchicine group (24.51±3.13% vs 11.38±2.46%, p=0.03). In the follow-up group mice (n=8), there were no differences between mice treated with placebo (n=9) and mice treated with colchicine (n=9) regarding to cardiac remodeling parameters but outflow approximated by the ITV was higher in the colchicine group.
3:::Ambient UFP concentrations were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (OR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.19) in fully adjusted models when exposures were assigned to residences 10-years prior to diagnosis. This risk estimate increased slightly (OR=1.17, 95% CI; 1.01, 1.35) when modeled as a non-linear natural spline function. A smaller increased risk (OR=1.04, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.11) was observed when exposures were assigned to residences at the time of diagnosis.
4:::Exposure to ambient UFPs may increase the risk of prostate cancer. Future studies are needed to replicate this finding as this is the first study to evaluate this relationship.
2:::Two radiologists with 7 and 15years of experience assessed 28 fistulas from 24 patients in each image set.
3:::A total of 1396 tonsillectomies were performed (279 by trainees, 1117 by consultant surgeons). Primary post-tonsillectomy bleed rates were equivalent between trainees and consultants. Secondary bleed rates were significantly greater for trainees (10.0 per cent) compared to consultants (3.3 per cent), as were return to operating theatre rates (2.5 per cent vs 0.7 per cent). Amongst consultants, technology used was not associated with differences in secondary post-tonsillectomy bleeding and returns to the operating theatre.
2:::The PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for articles that reported on contact sensitization in individuals with and without AD.
3:::The literature search yielded 10,083 citations; 417 were selected based on title and abstract screening and 74 met inclusion criteria. In a pooled analysis, no significant difference in contact sensitization between AD and controls was evident (random effects model odds ratio [OR] = 0.891; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.771-1.03). There was a positive correlation in studies that compared AD patients with individuals from the general population (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.23-1.93) but an inverse association when comparing with referred populations (OR 0.753, 95% CI 0.63-0.90).
4:::High BMI was a significant risk factor for SAH. Lower BMI showed a nonsignificant tendency toward higher risk of SAH. Our results suggest a J-shaped association between BMI and risk of SAH incidence.
3:::The mean patient age was 51.4 (range 18-94) years, 556 (55%) were female, and 567 individuals (59%) responded to the questionnaire. There were no statistically significant associations between time to surgery and either postoperative LOS or complications after adjusting for several patient and fracture characteristics. Patients operated on >6days after the trauma had significantly worse scores on the Olerud and Molander Ankle Score (OMAS) (p=0.039) and somewhat worse, but non-significant, scores on the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS; p=0.573) and the Self-Reported Foot and Ankle Score (SEFAS) scale (p=0.161) than those operated on <8h after trauma.
1:::This study introduces a real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging method with recently developed laser-activated nanodroplets (LANDs), a new class of phase-change nanometer-scale contrast agents that provides perceptible, sustained high-contrast with ultrasound.
2:::In response to pulsed laser irradiation, the LANDs-, which contain liquid perfluorohexane and optical fuses-blink (vaporize and recondense). That is, they change their state from liquid nanodroplets to gas microbubbles, and then back to liquid nanodroplets. In their gaseous microbubble state, the LANDs provide high-contrast ultrasound, but the microbubbles formed in situ typically recondense in tens of milliseconds. As a result, LAND visualization by standard, real-time ultrasound is limited. However, the periodic optical triggering of LANDs allows us to observe corresponding transient, periodic changes in ultrasound contrast. This study formulates a probability function that measures how ultrasound temporal signals vary in periodicity. Then, the estimated probability is mapped onto a B-scan image to construct a LAND-localized, contrast-enhanced image. We verified our method through phantom and in vivo experiments using an ultrasound system (Vevo 2100, FUJIFILM VisualSonics, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada) operating with a 40-MHz linear array and interfaced with a 10 Hz Nd:YAG laser (Phocus, Opotek Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) operating at the fundamental 1064 nm wavelength.
3:::Unsatisfactory clinical outcomes were found in 40.6% of the fracture cases vs. 6.3% controls (P = 0.003), according to Flynns criteria. Flexion-extension range of motion was decreased >5° in 13 cases (40.6%) and in four controls (12.5%, P = 0.013). One in four (N = 8, 25%) of the cases showed cubitus varus >5° and 15.7% (N = 5) had cubitus valgus >5°, compared to one cubitus valgus (3.1%) in controls (P = 0.002).'
4:::This research showed that low care and high overprotection of maternal and paternal parenting in childhood influence depressive symptoms indirectly through enhanced neuroticism in general adults. These findings suggest that neuroticism mediates the long-term effect of the quality of parenting on depression in adulthood.
3:::Sensitivity of early postoperative MRI for CCM remnant detection was 66.67% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.43%-99.16%), specificity was 76.74% (95% CI, 61.37%-88.24%), positive predictive value was 16.67% (95% CI, 2.09%-48.41%), and negative predictive value was 97.06% (95% CI, 84.67%-99.93%). Because of the high number of patients who could not be evaluated because of imaging artifacts, sensitivity and specificity analysis was not performed for early postoperative MRI using T2*/susceptibility-weighted imaging to assess hemosiderin remnants. Sensitivity of early postoperative MRI for hemosiderin remnant detection using T2-weighted sequences was 85.71% (95% CI, 63.66%-96.95%), specificity was 66.67% (95% CI, 44.68%-84.37%), positive predictive value was 69.23% (95% CI, 55.45%-80.27%), and negative predictive value was 84.21% (95% CI, 64.31%-94.04%).
2:::One hundred and nineteen RH and 136 HT subjects were included in this cross-sectional study. Genotypes were determined by real-time PCR using TaqMan probes. Haplotypes were estimated using Bayesian method.
4:::Appropriate examination, testing, and referrals within a timely manner are crucial in the management of dizzy patients to avoid misdiagnoses. It is imperative that patients undergoing ear surgery are appropriately counseled that dizziness is a potential complication. The analysis of malpractice literature is complementary to clinical studies, with the potential to educate practitioners, improve patient care, and mitigate risk.
3:::Distances from CA, CO, CCi and CCo to Pfrkt were all shorter in CAS group than control group (p<0.05). The straight and arc lengths of cartilaginous EAC in CAS group were shorter than control group (p<0.05). Straight and arc lengths of EAC in CAS group were shorter than those in control group (p<0.05). The proportion of one bending in cartilaginous EAC in control group was significantly lower than CAS group (p<0.05). Orientations of EAC bendings in CAS group differed from those in control group (p<0.05).
2:::Melanin content, cell viability, tyrosinase activity, p-CREB DNA binding activity, and the protein gene expression levels of the enzymes and proteins involved in melanogenesis were measured with the treatment of phytosphingosine.
3:::Significant immediate and long-term effects of depression were found for both sexes, indicating that adolescents with higher levels of depression were at increased risks for future sleep problems. For females only, the long-term effects further exacerbated the negative influences of immediate effects of depression on sleep problems. Moreover, the fluctuating effects were found to change over time in females and the influences were more pronounced in young adulthood.
2:::Medical records (1999-2016) of dogs with surgical correction of EU were reviewed. A continence score (1 = incontinent, 2 = sporadic incontinence, 3 = continent) was attributed preoperatively, at discharge, 1 month postoperatively, and at long-term evaluation.
4:::The large data set of tumour, background and systemic uptake/clearance data from 75 mice for 25 compounds allows identification of compounds of interest. The number of animals required was reduced considerably by longitudinal imaging compared to dissection experiments. All experimental work and analyses were accomplished within 3 months expected to be compatible with drug development programmes. QC along all workflow steps, blinding of the imaging contract research organization to compound properties and automation provide confidence in the data set. Additional ex vivo data were useful as a control but could be omitted from future studies in the same centre. For even larger compound libraries, radiolabelling could be expedited and the number of imaging time points adapted to increase weekly throughput. Multi-atlas segmentation could be expanded via SPECT/MRI; however, this would require an MRI-compatible mouse hotel. Finally, analysis of nuclear images of radiopharmaceuticals in clinical trials may benefit from the automated analysis procedures developed.
3:::The distribution of APL tendon slips was different for the DQT and control groups (Reader 1/Reader 2: P = 0.0001 and 0.001). The most common arrangement for both groups was two APL tendon slips. One tendon slip was less common (P = 0.03 and 0.1) and compartmentalization was more common (P = 0.003; < 0.0001) for the DQT group than the control group. There was no difference in tendon slip insertions on one or multiple bones (P = 0.1; 0.7). APL and EPB compartment CSAs were also higher for the DQT group (combined first extensor compartment area: 21.3 ± 7.6 mm(2); 21.0 ± 7.1) than the control group (17.2 ± 3.8; 17.1 ± 3.9) (P = 0.002; 0.002).
2:::A total of 383 patients with ADC 3 cm or smaller (stage IA) and 161 patients with stage IB ADC were identified from 2009 to 2010. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients as stratified by STAS and tumor size. A validation cohort was included in this study.
3:::Although MDA tissue levels were elevated significantly in the IR group compared with the sham group, SOD and GPx levels decreased. After the administration of curcumin, MDA levels in the spinal cord decreased, and SOD and GPx levels increased. Those changes were statistically significant. There was no significance at NO levels. Among all groups, there was no difference in IL-6 and myeloperoxidase immunostaining. Histopathological analysis showed that histopathological changes in the IR group were improved by curcumin treatment. In the curcumin group, neurological outcome scores were significantly better statistically when compared with the IR group.
2:::This case report describes the endodontic therapy of a mandibular first premolar with 2 roots and 3 canals with confirmation of cone-beam computed tomography. It also cites the incidence of morphologic variations reported in mandibular first premolars, based on ethnic diversity.
3:::The mean total score for the patients was 9.6 and for the controls 9.7 (p=0.77). A subgroup analysis of the mean score for the SI joints that were subjected to surgery was 4.3, compared to 4.8 in the conservatively treated SI joints in the patient group (p=0.23) and 4.8 for all SI joints in the control group (p=0.25). For patients with unilateral left-sided pain (n=40), the mean score for the left side was 5.2 and for the right side 4.9 (p=0.49). For patients with right-sided pain (n=41), the mean score for the right side was 4.8 and the left side 4.7 (p=0.55).
4:::ERCP and endoscopic bile stent insertion is a highly effective, minimally-invasive treatment for bile duct injury and should be included as part of the therapeutic procedures in pediatric patients with suspected bile duct injury.
3:::LSD, compared with placebo, significantly increased cognitive bizarreness (p < 0.001). The LSD-induced increase in cognitive bizarreness was positively correlated with the LSD-induced loss of self-boundaries and cognitive control (p < 0.05). Both LSD-induced increases in cognitive bizarreness and changes in state of consciousness were fully blocked by ketanserin.
2:::Forty-two patients with cardioembolic cerebral infarction in the anterior circulation territory underwent magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion-weighted imaging, 3-dimensional pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging, T2*-weighted imaging, and 3-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography using a 3-T magnetic resonance scanner. Visual assessments of proximal bright vessel sign and the susceptibility vessel sign were performed by consensus of 2 experienced neuroradiologists. The relationship between these signs and the occlusion site of magnetic resonance angiography was also investigated.
4:::These results showed disrupted WM integrity in these regions constitutes a potential neural basis for the facial emotion perception impairments in schizophrenia.
3:::Both groups showed marked significant reduction in recurrent tonsillitis that is comparable to results of tonsillectomy. There were no statistical differences between group A and B regarding the recurrence of infections and drug safety after six-month follow-up. Group B showed better compliance.
1:::To evaluate a tele-education system developed to improve diagnostic competency in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) by ophthalmologists-in-training in Mexico.
2:::The data were collected from mothers who had given birth as well as their midwives via questionnaire during the spring of 2014 during one week at eight maternity hospitals in Finland. The response rate was 59% for the new mothers (n=111), while it was 57% for the midwives (n=272). The data were analysed statistically and the open-ended questions in the questionnaire using content specifications.
4:::With the predicted demographic change and a shift toward more severe injury patterns (type B and C pelvic fractures) in the elderly population, trauma departments will need to develop specific surgical concepts for geriatric patients with pelvic ring fractures.
3:::A total of 114 trauma patients were treated during the time period. The mean age was 26.9 ± 10.1 years, 90% were males, and 96% were host nation patients. The most common mechanisms of injury were blast (49%) and gunshot (42%). Records were compliant with documenting a complete set of vitals in 58% and a pain score in 50% of patients. Recommendations for treatment of hypothermia were followed for 97% of patients. Tranexamic acid was given outside guidelines for 6% of patients, and for 40%, it was not determined if the guidelines were followed. Recommendations for initial resuscitative fluid were followed for 41% of patients. Recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis were followed for 40% of intra-abdominal and 73% of soft tissue injuries. Recommendations for tetanus prophylaxis were followed for 90% of patients. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was given to 32% of patients and contraindicated in 27%. The recommended transfusion ratio was followed for 56% of massive transfusion patients. Recommendations for calcium administration were followed for 40% of patients. When composite scores were created for individual surgeons, there was significant variability between surgeons with regard to adherence to guidelines.
2:::In this systematic review, we searched all related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that directly compared earlier and later RRT published prior to June 25, 2016, from PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We extracted the study characteristics and outcomes of all-cause mortality, RRT dependence, and intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay (LOS).
3:::The results of the examinations performed prior to transplantation revealed a decellularized ECM resembling to the native tissue with normal pits that may be appropriate for further in vivo cell seeding. Histopathology examination of the biopsies after transplantations confirmed successful cell seeding with endothelium-like cells in different time points. CD34 staining was dominant in the short-time biopsies, while CD31 staining was higher than CD34 in long-term specimens.
4:::This sub-study was underpowered to rule out moderate differences in HIV risk, but confirms the feasibility of randomised trial methodology to address this question. Larger RCTs are needed to determine the relative risks of various contraceptive methods on HIV acquisition with greater precision.
2:::Sources of data for the HLE computations were Swedish national mortality statistics and the nationwide Swedish Surveys of Living Conditions, conducted biennially by Statistics Sweden since 1974. We used the Sullivan method for calculations of HLE and a decomposition into mortality and disability effects was made.
3:::Life expectancy at age 65 (LE65) increased by 3.1 years for women and 4.0 years for men from 1980-1985 to 2006-2011. HLE65 calculated according to ADL and mobility limitations increased more rapidly than LE65 for both men and women ( p<0.05).
3:::FDG-PET findings were consistent with IPD in 27, MSA in 18, PSP in 19 and CBS in 2 patients. The final clinical diagnosis was IPD in 29, MSA in 20, PSP in 21 and CBS in 2 patients. Concordance between the FDG-PET and clinical diagnoses was 92% in the overall sample (IPD 93%, MSA 90%, PSP 91% and CBS 100%). The diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET was 93% for IPD and MSA and 97% for PSP.
2:::This was a retrospective case series from September 2007 to August 2016. The study was conducted at a tertiary medical center in Beijing, China (Xuanwu Hospital, China International Neuroscience Institute [China-INI], Capital Medical University). A total of 12 pediatric patients who had a clear traumatic history after back bend movements and had been diagnosed with thoracic SCIWORA were included. Clinical and imaging data were obtained for each patient. The follow-up data was analyzed. The traumatic mechanisms were investigated by analyzing the patients medical history, spinal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tractography data.'
4:::Back bend movements performed during dance practice may cause pediatric thoracic SCIWORA, particularly in children younger than 8 years old. We suggest that the mechanism of primary injury is the longitudinal distraction of the thoracic spine during back bend movements, which leads to violent distraction of the spinal cord and blunt injury of nerve axons, nerve cells, and small vessels. Spinal DTI may facilitate the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of SCIWORA.
3:::For CE data, all CVs were above 53%, R values indicated no-to-weak correlations between measures at best (range 0.01-0.25), and ICC values were all classified in the poor category (range 0.00-0.11). CVs for length and diameter measures were acceptably low indicating a high level of reliability.
2:::This international European telephone survey was conducted to provide an overview of current clinical practice of post cardiac arrest management with a main focus on TTM. We targeted large teaching and university hospitals within Europe as leading facilities and key opinion leaders in the field of post cardiac arrest care. Selected national principal investigators conducted the survey, which was based on a predefined questionnaire, between December 2014 and March 2015, before the publication of the ERC Guidelines 2015.
4:::We concluded that VP shunt is not a risk factor in the development of appendicitis in patients with TBI. Patients with TBI with a shunt and a CNS infection may have a greater risk of developing acute appendicitis. Therefore, care in avoiding CNS infection is a key for the prevention acute appendicitis in this patient population.
3:::Using standard field width, 188 ± 4 high-speed collisions were seen per team per season (18% of plays). When field width increased by 3 yards, high-speed collision rate decreased to 135 ± 3 per team per season (28% decrease; P < 0.0001).
2:::Participants were enrolled in the REactions to Acute Care and Hospitalization (REACH) study during ED evaluation for ACS. During inpatient stay or by phone after discharge, participants reported ASD symptoms in response to the event that brought them to the ED. ED or hospital readmissions within 30days of discharge were determined by research nurse record review. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between ASD symptoms and 30-day ED/hospital readmission.
3:::Symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis was classified using self-reported symptoms of neurogenic claudication and imaging. Among 430 community-dwelling older adults, 54 (13%) met criteria for symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis. Compared with participants without symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis, those with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis had more comorbidities, higher body mass index, greater pain, and less balance confidence. Participants with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis had greater impairment in trunk extensor muscle endurance, leg strength, leg strength asymmetry, knee flexion range of motion (ROM), knee extension ROM, and ankle ROM compared with participants without symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis. Five neuromuscular attributes were associated with performance-based mobility among participants with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis: trunk extensor muscle endurance, leg strength, leg strength asymmetry, knee flexion ROM, and knee extension ROM asymmetry.
1:::To evaluate the patterns of regression of iris melanoma after treatment with palladium-103 ((103)Pd) plaque brachytherapy.
4:::The most common findings related to iris melanoma regression after (103)Pd plaque brachytherapy included decreased intrinsic tumor vascularity, increased tumor pigmentation, and decreased tumor thickness with synchronous increase in internal ultrasonographic reflectivity. No irreversible sight-limiting complications were noted.
2:::Newborn infants with G6PD deficiency and a group with normal results obtained by the fluorescent spot test were selected for analyses of G6PD EA and the 10 commonly encountered G6PD mutations in this region, relating these with whether the infants required phototherapy before discharge from the hospital in the first week.
3:::A total of 222 infants with mean gestation and birth weight of 38.3 ± 1.8 weeks and 3.02 ± 0.48 kg, respectively, were enrolled. Of these, n = 121 were deficient with EA ≤6.76 U/g Hb, and approximately half (43%) received phototherapy in the first week after birth. The mean EA level was 3.7 U/g Hb. The EA had good accuracy in predicting phototherapy use, with area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve of 0.81 ± 0.05. Infants on phototherapy more commonly displayed World Health Organization Class II mutations (<10% residual EA). Logistic regression analysis showed that deficiency in EA and mutation at c.1388G>A (adjusted odds ratio, 1.5 and 5.7; 95% confidence interval: 1.31-1.76 and 1.30-25.0, respectively) were independent risk factors for phototherapy.
2:::Using the National Cancer Data Base, we identified 5029 patients diagnosed with T1-3N0-1 GBC and treated with surgical resection from 2005 to 2013. We described trends in receipt of adjuvant treatments for three time periods (2005-2007, 2008-2010, 2011-2013) and calculated three-year overall survival (OS) probabilities for 2989 patients treated in 2005-2010. All statistical tests were two-sided.
3:::The percentage of patients who received no adjuvant treatments was unchanged from 2005 to 2013. Adjuvant RT decreased from 4.2% to 1.7% ( P  < .001), adjuvant chemotherapy increased from 8.3% to 13.8% ( P  < .001), and adjuvant CRT remained stable at 15.9% ( P  = .98). Adjuvant treatments were associated with improved three-year OS, with adjusted hazard ratio of 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.39 to 0.58) for CRT, 0.77 (95% CI = 0.61 to 0.97) for chemotherapy, and 0.63 (95% CI = 0.44 to 0.92) for RT. Adjuvant CRT was associated with improved survival in all categories, except T1N0, and in patients with negative and positive margins.
4:::MSC2363318A has therapeutic efficacy in multiple preclinical models of ovarian and uterine cancer. These findings support clinical development of a dual AKT/P70S6K inhibitor.
3:::Several empirically supported frameworks are available to guide services for offenders who have CODs, including Integrated Dual Disorders Treatment (IDDT), the Risk-Need-Responsivity (RNR) model, and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Evidence-based services include integrated assessment that addresses both sets of disorders and the risk for criminal recidivism. Although several evidence-based COD interventions have been implemented at different points in the justice system, there remains a significant gap in services for offenders who have CODs. Existing program models include Crisis Intervention Teams (CIT), day reporting centers, specialized community supervision teams, pre- and post-booking diversion programs, and treatment-based courts (e.g., drug courts, mental health courts, COD dockets). Jail-based COD treatment programs provide stabilization of acute symptoms, medication consultation, and triage to community services, while longer-term prison COD programs feature Modified Therapeutic Communities (MTCs).
2:::We conducted the first genomewide association study (GWAS) on MGUS on 243 German cases with a replication on 294 Czech cases. Identified loci were further analyzed in 1508 German MM patients. New MM loci recently reported in a meta-analysis were also tested in the MGUS GWAS.
4:::MCGP-CS is an effective intervention for cancer survivors to improve personal meaning, psychological well-being and mental adjustment to cancer in the short term, and to reduce psychological distress in the long run.
3:::The majority of the independent PROMs (64 of 86; 74%) were written at or below the 6th grade level, with 81 of 86 (94%) written at or below the 8th grade level. All item banks (11 of 11) and short forms (four of four) of the PROMIS(®) were written below the 6th grade reading level. The median reading grade level of the 86 independent PROMs was 5.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 4.6-6.1). The PROMIS(®) question banks had a median reading grade level of 4.1 (IQR, 3.5-4.8); the Adult Short Forms had a median reading grade level of 4.2 (IQR, 4.2-4.3) There was no correlation appreciated between the median reading grade level and the number of questions contained in a PROM (r = -0.081; p = 0.460). For PROMs above NIH-recommended levels, following edits, all (five of five) achieved NIH reading level goals and three (three of five) achieved American Medical Association goals. Editing of these PROMs improved readability by 4.3 median grade level (before, 8.9 [IQR, 8.4-9.1], after 4.6 [IQR, 4.6-6.4], difference of medians, 4.3; p = 0.008).
2:::One hundred-fourteen eyes of open-angle glaucoma patients with localized RNFL defect who had 3 years worth of annual RNFL photography and OCT measurements were enrolled in this retrospective study. The progression rates of serial RNFL and GCIPL thicknesses (µm), angular width (°) and area (mm(2)) of defect on RNFL and GCIPL deviation maps were determined by linear mixed-effect models.'
3:::Few prospective rigorously controlled trials have been undertaken on the use of SERMs in men. Most existing trials are largely retrospective anecdotal studies with inconsistent inclusion and end-point measurements. The SERMs are complex and at times can produce paradoxical results. Their action likely depends on the genetics of the individual, his tissue-specific composition of estrogen receptors, the molecular structure and pharmacodynamics of the SERMs, and their metabolism.
2:::Thirty-four patients were prospectively enrolled (Group-A). Initially, radiofrequency energy was applied point-by-point guided by ME signals. If it failed, RF applications were applied conventionally guided by tip-ring signals. The data were compared with 32 and 32 patients undergoing CTI ablation using 8-mm tip (Group-B) and 3.5-mm irrigation-tip (Group-C) catheters, respectively.
4:::ME guided ablation using a novel ME equipped 10-mm tip ablation catheter was feasible for human CTI ablation, and might reduce inadvertent radiofrequency applications.
3:::Survey data were obtained from 1103 youth accessing Canadian homelessness services in the Nunavut territory and all Canadian provinces except for Prince Edward Island. Forty-two per cent of participants reported 1 or more suicide attempts, 85.4% fell in a high range of psychological distress, and key indicators of risk included an earlier age of the first episode of homelessness, female gender, and identifying as a sexual and/or gender minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and 2 spirit [LGBTQ2S]).
2:::Ex vivo: Hepatic stellate cells phenotype was analysed in human precision-cut liver slices in response to mitoquinone or vehicle. In vitro: Mitochondrial oxidative stress was analysed in different cell type of livers from control and cirrhotic rats. HSC phenotype, proliferation and viability were assessed in LX2, and in primary human and rat HSC treated with mitoquinone or vehicle. In vivo: CCl4 - and thioacetamide-cirrhotic rats were treated with mitoquinone (5 mg/kg/day) or the vehicle compound, DecylTPP, for 2 weeks, followed by measurement of oxidative stress, systemic and hepatic haemodynamic, liver fibrosis, HSC phenotype and liver inflammation.
3:::Sixty-seven patients were included in the study. Vitamin D deficiency was a significant predictor of hypocalcemia in patients in whom ≥3 parathyroid glands were identified, but not in patients in whom 0-2 parathyroid glands were identified intraoperatively (odds ratio [OR] 5.8; P = .036).
2:::We studied 34 VLBW and 19 term-born controls, and the VLBW group was further divided into a BPD group with severe radiographic BPD and those without radiographic BPD in infancy. Detailed right and left ventricular myocardial functions were analysed by velocity vector imaging, and the left ventricular mass was calculated. The associations between cardiac function and lung function were assessed by impulse oscillometry.
3:::In total, 3774 children were included in the analysis. Children with borderline subjective orthodontic treatment need and those with definite subjective orthodontic treatment need had significantly poorer OHRQoL based on the fully adjusted model (adjusted regression coefficient (aβ)=-0.49, 95% CI: -0.75, -0.30; (aβ)=-1.58, 95% CI: -1.81, -1.58, respectively). The association between subjective orthodontic treatment need and OHRQoL was stronger in girls than in boys and stronger in children with objective orthodontic treatment need than in those with none.
4:::Oral health-related quality of life is poorer in children with subjective orthodontic treatment need. This has not been investigated before in such a large-population-based study and clearly offers an explanation for the lack of concurrence between objective and subjective orthodontic treatment need.
3:::Fruit abundance increased with proximity to anthropogenic landmarks, and chimpanzees exhibited higher frequencies of antipredator behaviors as they approached these risky areas. However, predation risk did not deter adult males from visiting these fruiting trees; instead, risky foraging bouts were associated with higher food intakes and longer feeding times. Additionally, higher feeding rates were observed in open-canopy habitats, and this behavior may have minimized their risk of heat stress.
1:::To compare measurements from an Icare HOME rebound self-tonometer compared with those from a Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT).
4:::The Icare HOME tonometer is feasible for use in self-monitoring of IOP. Icare HOME tonometry measurements tend to overestimate IOP relative to GAT measurements.
2:::Two hundred fourteen healthy patients having spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean delivery were randomized to have their systolic BP maintained by phenylephrine administered by computer-controlled continuous infusion or computer-controlled intermittent boluses. From induction of anesthesia until the time of uterine incision, a noninvasive BP monitor was set to cycle at 1-minute intervals. In the infusion group, the infusion rate was automatically adjusted after each BP measurement using a previously described algorithm. In the bolus group, the algorithm was modified so that the mass of drug that would have been delivered over 1 minute was instead injected as a rapid intravenous bolus after each BP measurement. The precision of BP control was assessed using performance error calculations and compared between groups, with the primary outcome defined as median absolute performance error, and the latter being a measure of inaccuracy showing an average of the magnitudes of the differences of measured BP values above or below the target values.
3:::The results revealed that the ethyl acetate fraction of Zataria multiflora (IC50 = 0.35 ± 0.01 mg/mL) and petroleum ether fraction of Salvia mirzayanii (IC50 = 0.4 ± 0.11 mg/mL) were the most potent inhibitors of α-glucosidase in comparison with the other samples and acarbose as the standard (IC50 = 7 ± 0.19 mg/mL). All of the samples exhibited noncompetitive-uncompetitive inhibition.
4:::In the SEER database, ∼40% of the patients with glioma with imaging findings of GC do not receive microscopic confirmation of their diagnosis. We propose that tissue confirmation is warranted in patients with GC, because genomic analysis of these specimens may provide insights that will contribute to meaningful therapeutic intervention.
3:::Out of 246,459 ICU patients, 851 developed an ICU-cand, representing 0.3 per 1000 patients-days. The incidence rose sharply over time. Candida albicans was the main species. The overall and ICU mortality was 52.4% in ICU-cand patients. The main risk factors of ICU-cand were length of stay, severity of illness and antimicrobial therapy at ICU admission, immune status and use of invasive procedure. ICU-cand was an independent risk factor of mortality (OR: 1.53; 95%CI [1.40-1.70]); in a sub-group analysis, independent effects on mortality were observed with C. albicans (OR: 1.45 [1.23-1.71]), Candida tropicalis (OR: 2.11 [1.31-3.39]) and ""other"" Candida species (OR: 1.64 [1.09-2.45]).
2:::Two authors searched major electronic databases from inception until November-2016 for cross-sectional/longitudinal studies investigating depression and frailty. The strength of the reciprocal associations between frailty and depression was assessed through odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for potential confounders.
3:::The current recommended National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for identifying patients with HF was the most cost-effective option with a cost of £4400 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared to a ""do nothing"" strategy. That is, patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of HF should be referred straight for echocardiography if they had a history of myocardial infarction or if their NT-proBNP level was ≥400pg/ml. The MICE rule was more expensive and less effective than the other comparators. Base-case results were robust to sensitivity analyses.
4:::The incidence of DE during LEIs is 1% to 2% in the VSGNE database, and most patients are treated with additional endovascular interventions. The incidence increases in patients with critical limb ischemia and with the use of atherectomy.
2:::The present study was a monocentric retrospective analysis of 297 whole body DXA scans of children with CP. The prevalence of positive results of age- and height-adjusted BMC and aBMD defined as BMC and aBMD below the P3 percentile and of the FMBU-A was calculated.
3:::In total, 26,339 ER and/or PR-positive breast cancers were included in the study, of which 17% were ILC and 83% IDC. In patients with IDC, 86% of the tumors showed an ER expression level of 90% or more, compared to 84% in those with ILC. In both IDC and ILC a PR expression level of 90% or more was observed in 54% of the tumors. In postmenopausal patients aged 50-69 years no significant differences could be observed in ER and PR expression levels between ILC and IDC.
1:::Secretive eating, characterized by eating privately to conceal being seen, may reflect eating- and/or body-related shame, be associated with depression, and correlate with binge eating, which predicts weight gain and eating disorder onset. Increasing understanding of secretive eating in youth may improve weight status and reduce eating disorder risk. This study evaluated the prevalence and correlates of secretive eating in youth with overweight or obesity.
2:::A total of 260 consecutive tissue samples from RPs were collected between October 2014 and January 2016, transported at 4°C in serum-free media to an off-site central laboratory, dissociated, and cultured. A culture protocol, including a proprietary extracellular matrix formulation (ECMf), was developed that supports rapid and short-term single-cell culture of primary human prostate cells derived from fresh RP samples.
3:::A total of 251 samples, derived from RP samples, yielded primary human tumor and nontumor prostate cells. Cultured cells on ECMf exhibit (1) survival after transport from the operating room to the off-site centralized laboratory, (2) robust (>80%) adhesion and survival, and (3) expression of different cell-type-specific markers. Cells derived from samples of increasing Gleason score exhibited a greater number of focal adhesions and more focal adhesion activation as measured by phospho-focal adhesion kinase (Y397) immunofluorescence when patient-derived cells were cultured on ECMf. Increased Ki67 immunofluorescence levels were observed in cells derived from cancerous RP tissue when compared to noncancerous RP tissue.
4:::The present results showed only moderate concordance of the majority of elastography machines with the Fibroscan results, preventing the possibility of the immediate universal adoption of Fibroscan thresholds for defining liver fibrosis staging for all new machines.
3:::Both iRoot SP and MTA were non-toxic to the RAW 264.7 macrophages. The use of iRoot SP and MTA increased the expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-12p40 on the first day of culture and could promote macrophage M1 and M2 polarization.
2:::We conducted a nationwide population based cohort study using data from Swedish national registers. Swedish residents aged 18-75 years who were hospitalized for a manic episode between July 1, 2006 and December 2, 2014 were included. Prescription fills of lithium, valproate, olanzapine, quetiapine and aripiprazole were recorded throughout the first four weeks after hospital discharge, after which the patients were followed for up to one year. General and treatment specific rehospitalization risks were determined and results were adjusted for clinical and sociodemographic factors.
4:::The benefit of fever control using antipyretics in intensive care patients with regard to endpoints like lethality remains unclear. Randomized controlled trials with suitable protocols and endpoints are needed to provide a solid base for development of guidelines.
3:::An estimated 2.94 million U.S. youth (12%) engaged with ≥ one forms of online tobacco marketing. Compared with no engagement, the odds of susceptibility to the use of any tobacco product among never-tobacco users was independently associated with the level of online engagement: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.48 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-1.76) for one form of engagement and AOR = 2.37 (95% CI, 1.53-3.68) for ≥ two forms of engagement. The odds of ever having tried tobacco were also independently associated with the level of online engagement: AOR = 1.33 (95% CI: 1.11-1.60) for one form of engagement and AOR = 1.54 (95% CI, 1.16-2.03) for ≥ two forms of engagement. The level of online engagement was not independently associated with past 30-day tobacco use.
2:::A meta-analysis was performed on peer-reviewed articles and unpublished dissertations from 1975 to 2016 in five computerized databases ERIC, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, PubMed and ProQuest. Quantitative studies were retained if they included the following keywords: active consent (or informed consent or parental consent), passive consent (or waiver of consent), risk behavior, adolescen*.
4:::Spironolactone may be associated with higher risks for all-cause and infection-related mortality and HHF in pre-dialysis stage 5 CKD patients. Spironolactone should be used with caution in advanced CKD patients.
3:::Among 100 (82%) critical care nurses responding, nearly all (98%) knew of the existence of the sepsis protocol. However, many critical care nurses stated they would optimise blood pressure [with either fluid (38%) or both fluid and a vasopressor (23%)] before antibiotic initiation. Communicated barriers to rapid antibiotic initiation included: excessive patient workload (74%), lack of awareness IV antibiotic(s) ordered (57%) or delivered (69%), need for administration of multiple non-antibiotic IV medications (54%) and no IV access (51%).
2:::Two hundred and thirty-one older adults completed AST measures pre- and post-program.
3:::Stress was elevated during examinations periods. Women reported a greater stress level than men. Increased stress level was significantly associated with lower sleep quality and greater negative emotions (fear, anger). Exercise was an effective stress coping strategy, while other coping methods (Internet usage, meditation, and self-isolation) were associated with higher stress. Social media usage did not influence stress level.
1:::The purpose of this study was to determine the contractile patterns induced by oxytocin in myometrium exposed to magnesium sulfate (MgSO4). We hypothesized that MgSO4 pretreatment would reduce oxytocin-induced myometrial contractions in both oxytocin-naïve and oxytocin-desensitized myometrium.
4:::Primary excision biopsy of small, indeterminate soft-tissue masses within the setting of a specialist sarcoma service is a suitable management option. Only a small proportion of small superficial soft-tissue lesions with indeterminate MRI features are malignant tumours.
2:::BEAS-2B cells were exposed for 24h to CSE, H2O2, acrolein, 5,5-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), bacitracin, rutin or the anti-protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) antibody clone RL90; with or without NAC or GSH. EVs in media were measured using CD63(+)CD81(+) bead-coupled flow cytometry or tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS). For characterization by Western Blotting, cryo-transmission electron microscopy and TRPS, EVs were isolated using ultracentrifugation. Glutathione disulfide and GSH in cells were assessed by a GSH reductase cycling assay, and exofacial thiols using Flow cytometry.'
3:::AKI was recognized in 62 patients. In these patients, we found significantly higher physiological and surgical stress components of V-POSSUM and E-PASS scores in relation to patients without AKI. ROC analysis showed that the E-PASS score with a cutoff point ≥0.796 and the V-POSSUM score (morbidity) with a cutoff point ≥77.2% with sensitivity of 75.8% and 74.2%, respectively, and with specificity of 83.5% for both, identified patients with postoperative AKI.
3:::Out of 160 patients included in this study, 72 and 80 patients had MRI within 6 and 8 hours of SxO, respectively. We found a positive correlation between SIR and time from SxO (Pearson coefficient, .63). Receiver operating characteristic curves indicated that SIR ≤ 1.18 could accurately identify patients within 6 hours of SxO (86% sensitivity, 79% specificity) and a SIR ≤ 1.20 can be identified within 8 hours (89% sensitivity, 76% specificity). Among patients with no visible FLAIR hyperintensity, 83% (95% CI, 77%-89%) were within the 6-hour window.
2:::A total of 75 137 publicly available fundus images from diabetic patients were used to train and test an artificial intelligence model to differentiate healthy fundi from those with DR. A panel of retinal specialists determined the ground truth for our data set before experimentation. We also tested our model using the public MESSIDOR 2 and E-Ophtha databases for external validation. Information learned in our automated method was visualized readily through an automatically generated abnormality heatmap, highlighting subregions within each input fundus image for further clinical review.
4:::A fully data-driven artificial intelligence-based grading algorithm can be used to screen fundus photographs obtained from diabetic patients and to identify, with high reliability, which cases should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and treatment. The implementation of such an algorithm on a global basis could reduce drastically the rate of vision loss attributed to DR.
3:::A total of 35 and 28 papers underwent data extraction for RA and dyslipidemia, respectively. Within the constraints of the analysis, adherence and persistence rates appeared broadly similar for the different routes of drug administration in RA. Adherence to oral medications was also broadly similar across the two diseases, but persistence was lower in dyslipidemia. Poor adherence has clinical consequences in both diseases: greater disease activity and risk of flare in RA, and increased serum cholesterol levels and risk of heart and cerebrovascular disease in dyslipidemia. Over 1-3 years, poor adherence to biologic RA medications led to increased resource use and medical costs but lower total direct costs due to reduced biologic drug costs. Conversely, poor adherence to dyslipidemia medications resulted in increased total direct costs. In both diseases, adherence improved with patient education/support.
2:::We studied 90 patients who had undergone PD between September 2005 and January 2015. The inclusion criteria were as follows: available unenhanced CT within one month before PD and at least one unenhanced CT acquisition between PD and chemotherapy initiation. Using scanners, we studied the liver and spleen density as well as the surface areas of visceral (VF) and subcutaneous fat (SCF). These variables were previously identified by univariate and multivariate analyses.
3:::In rural and urban Nigeria, IMRs were 70 and 49 deaths per 1000 live births, respectively. Risk factors in rural residence were past maternal marital union (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.625, p = 0.020), small birth size (AOR: 1.550, p < 0.001), birth interval <24 months (AOR: 2.057, p < 0.001), residence in North-East (AOR: 1.346, p = 0.038) and North-West (AOR: 1.653, p < 0.001) regions, and cesarean delivery (AOR: 2.922, p = 0.001). Risk factors in urban residence were poor wealth index (AOR: 2.292, p < 0.001), small birth size (AOR: 2.276, p < 0.001), male gender (AOR: 1.416, p = 0.022), birth interval <24 months (AOR: 1.605, p = 0.002), maternal obesity (AOR: 1.641, p = 0.008), and cesarean delivery (AOR: 1.947, p = 0.032).
4:::This retrospective study indicates that the endoscopic endonasal approach is an effective treatment for SNM in selected cases and, when performed by a skilled surgeon, can enable successful radical resection with a similar efficacy as traditional open resection.
2:::This population-based cross-sectional study examined data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Participants were divided into groups according to age (25-49/≥50 years) and sex. We examined total fat mass (TFM) and percentage fat mass (pFM) as indicators of total obesity and truncal fat mass (TrFM) as an indicator of abdominal obesity. We calculated the composite indices of FN strength and anthropometric clinical indicators of abdominal obesity.
1:::Little is known about the extent of switches from prescription-only (Rx) to over-the-counter (OTC) status in Europe and about the pharmacological properties of the switched substances. The objectives of this study were to provide an overview of the substances that were switched from Rx to OTC status in Germany between 2006 and 2015 and to assess their pharmacological properties.
3:::Between 2006 and 2015, seven substances (almotriptan, omeprazole, benzydamine, ibuprofen/pseudoephedrine, racecadotril, ketotifen and levonorgestrel) were switched from Rx to OTC status in Germany. In all cases, the OTC status was restricted to certain indications, doses, pack sizes, or other limitations. Notwithstanding recommendations of the EU switch guide, some of the switched substances might interact with commonly used drugs potentially resulting in serious adverse drug reactions or have contraindications or warnings regarding substantial parts of the population.
4:::As a possible precursor stage, prior PCOS is a significant and independent risk factor for development of POI. The use of metformin reduces the risk of POI.
3:::Patients (males 81%; 60 ± 10 years) presented with typical cardiovascular risk factors and similar baseline characteristics. Participants did not perceive an increased risk of injury and were more interactive. At the end of the program, there was a lower tendency for dropping out (6% vs 19%, P > .05), a significant improvement in PA (322 vs 247 arbitrary acceleration units/min, P = .047) and related EE per body weight (13 vs 11 kcal/kg/d, P = .04) among AVG participants compared with controls. No significant differences between groups for adverse medical events, exercise capacity, affect toward exercise, anxiety, depression, or quality-of-life changes were reported.
2:::In 65 metabolic syndrome patients, aged 56.5 ± 1.3 years (mean ± SEM), we measured over a 30-min resting period blood pressure, HR (ECG), venous plasma norepinephrine (HPLC) and MSNA (microneurography). We also evaluated anthropometric and metabolic variables including HOMA index, correlating them with the adrenergic markers. The same measurements were also made in 48 age-matched healthy controls.
3:::The median procedure time for the Neonatal Intubation Trainer was significantly longer with feeding tubes without Magill forceps. For the more difficult ALS Baby Trainer, successful procedures lasted a median of 24 (17-32) seconds with ETT, 24 (15-36) seconds with stylet-guided catheters and 34 (27-46) seconds and 37 (29-42) seconds with 13-cm and 30-cm angiocatheters, respectively. Both methods using feeding tubes were statistically slower than ETT intubation, lasting 32 (25-44) seconds and 39 (27-95) seconds with or without Magill forceps. Failure rates (7-20%) were no different between the LIST methods. Techniques using feeding tubes were rated as more difficult.
2:::PLAC8 mRNA expression was investigated in 31 pairs of fresh ccRCC tumor tissues and matched adjacent non-tumor tissues by RT-qPCR and confirmed by analyzing the TCGA KRCC dataset which contains RNA-seq data of 534 ccRCC and 72 solid normal tissues. Protein level of PLAC8 expression was also investigated using immunohistochemistry in 129 ccRCC samples. Correlations with clinicopathological factors and overall survival were analyzed. To examine its effect on the biological activity, PLAC8 siRNAs were transfected into ccRCC cells. Cell proliferation was assessed by CCK8 cell viability assays, clone formation assays, and EdU incorporation assays. Cell invasion was examined using transwell assays. RNA sequencing was then performed to further elucidate the mechanisms by which PLAC8 regulates the cancer.
4:::Patients with gout have shorter telomeres than healthy participants, reflecting increased cellular senescence. Telomere shortening was associated with the number of flares and with cardiovascular disease in people with gout.
3:::The average SKNA (aSKNA) 10 seconds before AT onset was 1.07 ± 0.10 μV and 10 seconds after termination was 1.27 ± 0.10 μV; both were significantly (P = .032 and P < .0001) higher than that during sinus rhythm (0.97 ± 0.09 μV). The aSKNA 10 seconds before AF onset was 1.34 ± 0.07 μV and 10 seconds after termination was 1.31 ± 0.07 μV; both were significantly (P < .0001) higher than that during sinus rhythm (1.04 ± 0.07 μV). The aSKNA before onset (P < .0001) and after termination (P = .0011) was higher in AF than in AT. The sinus rate correlated (P < .0001) with aSKNA in each patient (average r = 0.74; 95% confidence interval 0.65-0.84). The r value in each patient negatively correlated with the number of AT and AF episodes (r = -0.6493; 95% confidence interval -0.8990 to -0.08073; P = .0306).
2:::A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2014 and January 2015 among general practice specialists and interns from 14 health centres in a northern Portuguese health region. The self-report questionnaire included the Portuguese version of the Jefferson scale of physician empathy (JSPE) and a questionnaire about placebo prescription. Associations between demographic variables, JSPE score, prescription of placebo, and the attitudes to placebo score were tested with the chi-squared statistic, student t-tests for independent samples, and Pearson correlation.
3:::Of 547 hips in 484 consecutive patients, 98 elite athletes (49 female) with a mean follow-up of 18.9 ± 12.8 months were identified. Eighty patients desired to return to their original competitive activity: 38 were female (42 hips; mean age, 21.5 ± 3.9 years), and 42 were male (54 hips; mean age, 20.5 ± 1.9 years). Moreover, 84.2% of female athletes and 83.3% of male athletes were able to return to the same level of competition at a mean of 8.3 ± 3.0 and 8.8 ± 2.9 months, respectively. Significant improvements between preoperative and postoperative outcome scores were seen in both groups (all P < .0001). Female athletes had more pincer femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) ( P = .0004) and instability ( P < .0001). Conversely, male athletes were diagnosed more commonly with combined FAI ( P < .0001), demonstrated greater acetabular cartilage damage ( P = .0004), and required microfracture more often ( P = .0014). Female athletes competed more frequently in flexibility (4/38, 11%; P = .047) and endurance (9/38, 24%) sports, while male athletes participated in cutting (14/42, 33%), contact (6/42, 14%), and asymmetric (13/42, 31%) sports more often. Patients who returned to their baseline level of competition had a shorter duration of symptoms preoperatively ( P = .001). Microfracture status did not affect the ability to return to sports.
4:::Our findings among males indicate that variation in the strength of selectivity in utero accounts for a portion of observed cohort differences in morbidity due to birth defects. These findings suggest that ""revealed prevalence"" of morbidity across birth cohorts varies, at least in part, from selective loss in utero. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B209.
2:::An anonymous on-line survey was sent to 108 United States ACGME-approved dermatology residency programs assessing frequency of facial protection during dermatologic procedures, personal history of splash injury, and, if applicable, reasons for not always wearing facial protection.
3:::When the right carotid sinus was stimulated at 1 Hz frequency, a dose-effect relationship was observed between stimulation intensity (100-250% motor threshold) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) decrement (3.6 ± 1.0 to 10.4 ± 2.3 mmHg). When stimulation intensity was fixed at 200% motor threshold, the median reduction of MAP in 1-Hz group [10.8 (8.6-14.9) mmHg] was significantly higher than that in other frequency groups (all P < 0.05). Heart rates declined transiently after the initiation of MSCS. Compared with baseline (33.9 ± 5.5 pg/ml), plasma epinephrine level increased during MSCS (88.1 ± 9.6, P = 0.002). After ipsilateral sinoaortic denervation, MAP decrement (7.0 ± 0.8 mmHg) was remarkably blunted compared with that in sham animals (13.0 ± 1.1 mmHg, P = 0.001).
3:::The MOLEE LD50 was estimated to be 5585 mg/kg. MOLEE (500 mg/kg) administration fundamentally repressed the expansion event of knobs and the normal knob number per knob-bearing livers prompted by DEN, enhanced hepatocellular appearance and altogether significantly decreased (p < 0.05) DEN-induced elevations in serum biochemical records and hepatic 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels by 29%. The robotic studies found that MOLEE disrupted the DEN-activated oxidative reactivity damage in rats by 46.8%. Curiously, the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and β-arrestin-2 were fundamentally diminished (p < 0.05); however, the expression of Bax and caspase-3 were essentially (p < 0.05) upregulated.
2:::ICP was measured in obese and lean Zucker rats over a period of 28 days. Arterial pCO2 and serum retinol were measured in serum samples. The CPs were isolated, and target messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein were analyzed by quantitative PCR and western blot, respectively.
3:::Patients on chronic methadone maintenance used significantly more opioids than patients not on methadone during their entire inpatient stay (P < .001). This was demonstrated by a higher median daily usage of opioids and higher patient-controlled analgesia usage. Patients on methadone maintenance had a significantly longer postoperative inpatient hospitalization (P < .001). Finally, these patients required significantly more inpatient pain management referrals (P = .025).
4:::A modest and consistent incidence of postsuppression VR was documented during adolescence in our cohort. Having poor weight, receiving second-line regimens, and prior VF were associated with an increased VR rate. Adolescents at higher risk of VR may benefit from more intensive VL monitoring to enhance adherence management.
1:::In 1999, we developed a technique using frozen autografts-tumour-containing bone treated with liquid nitrogen-for the reconstruction of malignant bone tumours. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functional and oncological outcomes of frozen autografts for intercalary reconstruction of malignant bones and soft tissue tumours.
2:::Data were collected during the baseline survey of the International Mobility in Aging Study conducted in 2012 in Kingston (Canada), Saint-Hyacinthe (Canada), Tirana (Albania) and Manizales (Colombia). Salivary cortisol was collected from a subsample of 309 participants instructed to collect saliva on two consecutive days, and 5 different intervals each day: upon awakening (M1), 30min (M2) and 60min after awakening, at 15:00h and before bedtime (E). Cortisol was analyzed using enzyme immunoassay kits. Physical performance was measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Mixed linear models were fit to assess the associations between cortisol diurnal output and physical performance, adjusting for potential confounders.
3:::Lamina propria cells in colon tissues of patients with IBD, and mice with colitis, had increased expression of IL28 compared with controls; levels of IL28R were increased in the colonic epithelium of patients with IBD and mice with colitis. Administration of IL28 induced phosphorylation of STAT1 in primary human and mouse IECs, increasing with dose. Il28ra(-/-), Irf3(-/-), Irf3(-/-)Irf7(-/-), as well as Stat1IEC-KO mice, developed more severe colitis after administration of dextran sulfate sodium than control mice, with reduced epithelial restitution. Il28ra(-/-) and Stat1IEC-KO mice also developed more severe colitis in response to oxazolone than control mice. We found IL28 to induce phosphorylation (activation) of STAT1 in epithelial cells, leading to their proliferation in organoid culture. Administration of IL28 to mice with induced colonic wounds promoted mucosal healing.
2:::In January of 2016, we conducted a PubMed search for mobile applications for cancer survivors. A total of 32 articles were selected for inclusion, including 13 review articles, and 19 articles describing an mHealth application or intervention. We assessed mobile app development and testing strategies and standards as described in these articles.
4:::There is tremendous potential for mobile health apps to benefit cancer survivors. However, there are specific issues for consideration in developing new applications and steps for creating user-centered applications which are not routinely used. This diminishes the value for the cancer survivor population but could be easily addressed through standardized development and testing procedures.
3:::Thirty-two cases were matched against 64 controls. tTWA values above 11 ng/mL at 6 and 12 months after transplantation were associated with odds ratio (OR) of 3.1 (95% CI 1.1-9) and 11.7 (95% CI = 1.3-106), respectively, for post-transplant cancer; and with OR of 5.2 (95% CI 1.3-20.5) and 14.1 (95% CI = 1.5-134.3), respectively, for cancer diagnosed more than 3 years after transplantation.
2:::Total 30 males (median age: 46.00 years, interquartile range: 42.00-51.25 years) with unilateral TAO in the lower extremity underwent RFA were retrospectively enrolled from January 2013 and October 2013. The pre-operative and post-operative digital subtraction angiographic (DSA) images were recorded. Pain scores preoperatively and postoperatively were assessed according to the World Health Organization Pain Guideline. The values of ankle brachial index (ABI) at pre-operation, post-operation, 2 weeks and 2 years after surgery were all recorded and analyzed. Additionally, a 2-year follow up was performed by a computed tomographic angiography (CTA) image.
3:::There were 342 patients, of which 165 (48%) had a current CVC and 29 (8.5%) had BVW of at least 1 arm. Right-sided BVW were associated with a history of a prior ipsilateral CVC (odds ratio [OR] = 4.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6-12.6, P = 0.009). Of the 342 patients, 69 (20%) had a venogram within 6 months. Seventeen (25%) of the 69 patients had CVS, with 7 involving the left subclavian vein, 8 the right subclavian vein, and 3 the superior vena cava (one patient had tandem stenoses). A BVW on the left side was not associated with any CVS. A BVW on the right side was associated with an ipsilateral CVS (OR = 5.8, 95% CI = 1.2-27.4, P = 0.04). This association persisted in the setting of a prior CVC (relative risk = 1.3, 95% CI = 0.9-2, P = 0.01).
4:::There are associations between right-sided BVW and an ipsilateral subclavian vein stenosis. We recommend that hemodialysis access planning includes venography to rule out central vein stenosis in patients with BVW, especially if right-sided and in the setting of a prior CVC.
2:::324 patients presenting to the ED with chest pain were enrolled. Resting ECG was recorded and later analyzed by an HFQRS algorithm. Results were compared to the conventional ECG diagnosis by 3 independent interpretations: treating physician, expert cardiologist and an automated computer program.
3:::Urgent stenting and mechanical thrombectomy was performed in 6 patients. In the remaining 5 cases, elective endovascular treatment was planned after initial anticoagulation therapy with thrombus resolution. One case received secondary urgent treatment due to clinical deterioration. Overall outcome at three months follow-up was excellent (Modified Ranking Scale [mRS] 0-1) in 5 cases, good (mRS 2) in 4 and unfavorable in the remaining 2. Important differences between the two treatment arms were seen in 3 parameters (stenosis degree, thrombus length, and NIHSS score).
4:::Our study supports previous findings indicating that cancer survivors have an increased risk for subfertility. Survivors diagnosed in their childhood had the lowest risk for fertility treatment and seemed to get pregnant with less extensive fertility treatments than survivors diagnosed as adults. Time elapsed from cancer treatment played a central role, increasing the need for fertility treatments compared to siblings, suggesting that cancer therapies might lead to diminished ovarian reserve.
3:::There were 728 total hemiflaps: 263 (36.1 percent) based on the lateral row, 225 (30.9 percent) based on the medial row, and 240 (33.0 percent) based on both the medial and lateral rows. The groups were well matched by perforator number and flap weight. Fat necrosis occurrence was significantly higher in flaps based solely on the medial row versus lateral row perforators (24.5 percent versus 8.2 percent; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in fat necrosis between flaps based only on the lateral row versus flaps based on both the medial and lateral rows (8.2 percent versus 11.6 percent; p = 0.203). Generally, within the same row, increasing the number of perforators decreased the incidence of fat necrosis.
2:::Seventy-four patients with at least one site showing absence or a reduced amount of attached gingiva associated with gingival recession (GR) at baseline were treated with FGGs in a private practice. Patient/tooth/site-associated variables were recorded for each patient (treated and mesial/distal adjacent teeth) at baseline (T0), 6 months after surgery (T1), during the follow up period (T2) (mean 15.3 years), and at the end of the follow-up period (T3) over 25 years. Parametric, non-parametric, and mixed effects logistic regression statistics were used throughout the study.
4:::Active choice through the EHR was associated with a significant increase in influenza vaccination rates.
3:::We found that CFA increased c-fos and glutamate immunoreactivity in TNC and C1-C2 neurons. This effect was mitigated by SZR72. PACAP positive fibers were detected in the fasciculus cuneatus and gracilis. Substance P, TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β immunopositivity were detected in fibers of Sp5 and neither of these molecules showed any change in immunoreactivity following CFA administration.
1:::Comorbidities had considerable effects on the prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The primary aim of the present study was to examine the influence of comorbidity on the risk of anastomotic leak (AL) in patients with CRC who underwent surgical resection.
2:::Twenty-six eyes of 13 patients affected by unilateral idiopathic ERM were prospectively analyzed. 13 fellow eyes were used as control. The static (central retinal artery and vein equivalents) and dynamic (after flicker light stimulus) DVA analysis was performed at baseline (1 day before surgery) and 6 months after vitrectomy.
4:::This study identified consumer preferences and acceptance of ""visual"" PSEA such as portion pots/cups to estimate appropriate PS of amorphous grain foods such as breakfast cereals, pasta and rice. Concise information from a reputable source in relation to gender, age and activity level should accompany PSEA.
3:::Higher-cost diets were more likely to be DASH-accordant. After adjustment for key demographics and exposure to other food outlets, individuals with lowest economic accessibility to supermarkets had lower odds of being DASH-accordant (OR=0.59, 95% CI=0.52, 0.68) than individuals with greatest economic accessibility. This association was stronger than with geographic accessibility alone (OR=0.85, 95% CI=0.74, 0.98).
2:::We retrospectively evaluated 352 patients who underwent LAGB between 2011 and 2015. LAGB-associated complications developed in 26 patients (7.4%). This study involved six patients (1.7%) who received endoscopic treatment.
3:::Dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) digestibility decreased linearly with increasing F:C ratio in both goats and Sika deer. In both goats and Sika deer, the CH4 emissions expressed as g/d, g/kg BW(0.75), % of gross energy intake, g/kg DM intake (DMI), and g/kg OM intake (OMI) decreased linearly as the F:C ratio increased, however, the CH4 emissions expressed as g/kg digested DMI and OMI were not affected by the F:C ratio. Eight equations were derived for predicting the enteric CH4 emission from goats and Sika deer. For goat, equation 1 was found to be of the highest accuracy: CH4 (g/d) = 3.36+4.71×DMI (kg/d)-0.0036×neutral detergent fiber concentrate (NDFC, g/kg)+0.01563×dry matter digestibility (DMD, g/kg)-0.0108×neutral detergent fiber digestibility (NDFD, g/kg). For Sika deer, equation 5 was found to be of the highest accuracy: CH4 (g/d) = 66.3+27.7×DMI (kg/d)-5.91×NDFC (g/kg)-7.11× DMD (g/kg)+0.0809×NDFD (g/kg).
4:::Our study showed that increased stromal CS-E expression is related to the degree of the tubal epithelium abnormality. Specific alterations in the ECM (ie, CS-E expression) occur early in pelvic HGSC development and may represent a novel biomarker of early cancer progression, useful for the identification of novel clinical strategies.
2:::Six laboratories received samples containing spiked PNH leukocyte clones to be analyzed in parallel with a common six-color cocktail (FLAER/CD24/CD45/CD64/CD15/CD14) and a simplified two-color mixture (FLAER/CD15), a shared calibration procedure, and a common analysis protocol. Replicate precision and sensitivity tests were performed on PNH patients, from undiluted to 1:10 000. Specificity tests were performed on normal donors to identify the possible sources of artifacts.
3:::The performance comparison between six-color and two-color assays showed an excellent agreement for granulocyte PNH clones. Dilution experiments showed an accurate detectability down to 0.01% sensitivity level for granulocyte PNH clones and to 1% for monocytes. Specificity experiments disclosed that basophils and platelets can contaminate the monocyte gate and generate false PNH events.
3:::Mean surgeon age was 54 years, 25% were female, and median number of years in practice was 21. Wide MRI use variation was observed, with 26% obtaining MRI for a clinical stage I screen-detected breast cancer and 72% for infiltrating lobular cancer. High users of MRI were significantly more likely to be higher-volume surgeons (p < 0.001) and to have misconceptions about MRI benefits (p < 0.001). Of surgeons who felt they used MRI more often, 60% were high MRI users; only 6% were low MRI users.
2:::We used tracer techniques to quantify basal splanchnic (primarily hepatic) glucose uptake and glucose fluxes following glucose ingestion in individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT; n = 10) and IFG (n = 10).
4:::Provision of the LNG-IUS at no cost to low-income Brazilian women reduced unwanted pregnancies and probably averted maternal mortality and morbidity, child mortality and unsafe abortions. Family planning programs, policymakers and stakeholders based in low-resource settings could take advantage of the information that the provision of this contraceptive at no cost, or at affordable cost to a publicly-insured population, is an effective policy to help promote womens health.'
3:::Week 1 OMT showed concordance with ITT at week 7 of 78% and glucocorticoid requirement at 6 months of 81% respectively which was not significantly different from post-operative morning cortisol levels; 37% of participants with an abnormal OMT on day 6 had a normal OMT at week 6. All HPA axis tests showed similar concordance with glucocorticoid requirement at 6 months of 80%-85%.
2:::A total of 225 patients were propensity matched on 5 potential confounders among 3 study groups (75 per group): (1) pectoralis; (2) serratus; and (3) control. The propensity-matched cohort was used to evaluate the effect of the study group on postoperative in-hospital oral morphine equivalent consumption and PONV. We considered pectoralis noninferior to serratus block if it was noninferior for both outcomes, within 10 mg morphine and 17.5% in PONV incidence margins. Other outcomes included intraoperative fentanyl requirements, pain scores, time to first analgesic request, and duration of recovery room stay.
4:::We found that PLWH who also have CMP have significantly higher levels of IL-1β than PLWH who do not have any pain. Future work on the role of IL-1β on chronic pain pathogenesis in this population may inform novel approaches to chronic pain management.
3:::Trypanosoma cruzi and Toxoplasma gondii infection is related to TLR-2 and TLR-4/TLR-9, respectively. Trypanosoma cruzi elicits an increase in TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 cytokine secretion whereas T. gondii only increases the secretion of IL-8.
2:::An observational study of hyperglycaemic crises cases using the database maintained by the out-of-hospital emergency service, the Healthcare Emergency Public Service (EPES) during 2012. The EPES provides emergency medical services to the total population of Andalusia, Spain (8.5 million inhabitants) and records data on the incidence, resource utilization and cost of out-of-hospital medical care. Direct costs were estimated using public prices for health services updated to 2012.
3:::We found that serum/hepatic DcR3 levels were lower in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients with HS. DcR3a protected Zucker rats with HS from IR liver injury. The beneficial effects of DcR3a supplement were mediated by inhibiting hepatic M1 polarization of KCs, decreasing serum/hepatic TNFα, nitric oxide, nitrotyrosine, soluble TNF-like cytokine 1A, Fas ligand, and interferon-γ levels, neutrophil infiltration, and improving hepatic microcirculatory failure among rats with IR-injured steatotic livers. Additionally, downregulated hepatic TNF-like cytokine 1A/Fas-ligand and toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-κB signals were found to mediate the DcR3a-related protective effects of steatotic livers from IR injury.
4:::Anxiety was more robustly associated with increase in migraine risk than depression. Lack of ability to properly control worrying and to relax are the most prominent issues in migraine psychiatric comorbidity. Physical symptoms in depression are more linked to migraine than emotional symptoms. A symptom-based approach helps clarifying migraine comorbidity and should be replicated in other studies.
2:::Patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the GI tract (esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum) between 2006 and 2014 were identified from a prospective database. Computed tomography (CT) scans were analyzed using a transverse section at L3 to calculate sex-specific body composition indices for skeletal muscle, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analysis were used to compare unadjusted survival. Multivariate survival analyses were performed using a proportional hazards model.
1:::We report the first case of human infection and keratitis secondary to Trametes betulina, a rare filamentous fungus.
3:::The culture from the corneal scraping revealed a basidiomycetous fungus which was submitted for identification. DNA extraction with sequencing and analysis of the ITS and D1/D2 regions were performed on the isolate and demonstrated 100% similarity to Lenzites betulina/Trametes betulina. Susceptibility testing demonstrated potent in vitro activity of voriconazole (MIC < 0.03 μg/ml). The patient was treated with voriconazole, and the corneal ulcer and infiltrate resolved. The infection resulted in corneal thinning and a dense central corneal scar. Penetrating keratoplasty was performed 5 months after diagnosis and treatment and revealed stromal scarring without fungal elements.
2:::Twelve lumbosacral specimens were non-destructively loaded in flexion, extension, lateral bending, and torsion. Sequentially, the tested conditions were intact, two-level transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) (L3-L5), followed by lateral lumbar interbody fusion procedures at L2-L3 including interbody alone, a supplemental lateral plate, a supplemental spinous process plate, and then either cortical screw or pedicle screw fixation. A three-level TLIF was the final instrumented condition. In all conditions, three-dimensional kinematics were tracked and range of motion (ROM) was calculated for comparisons. Institutional funds (<$50,000) in support of this work were provided by Medtronic Spine.
3:::The addition of a lateral interbody device superadjacent to a two-level fusion significantly reduced motion in flexion, extension, and lateral bending (p<.05). Supplementing with a lateral plate further reduced ROM during lateral bending and torsion, whereas a spinous process plate further reduced ROM during flexion and extension. The addition of posterior cortical screws provided the most stable lateral lumbar interbody fusion construct, demonstrating ROM comparable with a traditional three-level TLIF.
4:::Despite wide variation in practice patterns surrounding CEA in the So Cal VOICe, postoperative complications were uniformly low. Further work will focus on identifying practices that can be modified to improve cost-effectiveness while maintaining excellent outcomes.
3:::Large and medium HRQoL improvements were reported during first-line treatments. No clinically beneficial change or deteriorations in scores of global QoL or fatigue were reported during relapse treatment. HRQoL data during maintenance therapy are sparse and inconclusive.
2:::We did a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent sacrococcygeal teratoma resection between January 1998 and March 2016. Demographic data, transfusion data, and tumor characteristics were collected. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and univariate comparisons were performed with chi-square test and Fishers exact test. Variables significant at univariate level were used in multivariate logistic regression and negative binomial regression.'
4:::The prevalence of ID at 4 and 5 mo of age in predominantly breastfed, term infants was 21.4% and 36.4%, respectively. The study generates evidence for considering iron supplementation for well-babies from 4 mo of age, instead of the currently recommended 6 mo by National Iron plus Initiative in India.
3:::A total of 21,177 persons responded to the ESS and were included in the analyses. The odds ratio (OR) for EDS was increased for migraineurs (1.42 (95% CI 1.31─1.54), p < 0.001) compared to non-migraineurs; however, this finding was not significant after adjustment for a number of possible confounders. EDS increased with increasing headache frequency, with an OR of 2.74 (95% CI 2.05─3.65), p < 0.001) for those with headache on >179 days per year compared to those without headache in multivariable analysis.
2:::A streptozotocin-induced mouse model of diabetes (C57BL/6J background) received insulin-releasing pellets and pancreatic islet-cell transplantation. Damage to the neurovascular unit was studied by quantitative retinal morphometry for microvascular changes and microarray analysis, with subsequent functional annotation clustering, for changes of the retinal genome.
3:::Treadmill exercise for 4 weeks reversed MIA-induced tactile hypersensitivity and weight asymmetry. Both IA and RVM lidocaine D35, administered post-MIA, induced CPP in sedentary but not exercised MIA-treated rats, indicating that exercise blocks MIA-induced ongoing pain. Naloxone reestablished weight asymmetry in MIA-treated rats undergoing exercise and induced conditioned place aversion, indicating that exercise-induced pain relief is dependent on endogenous opioids. Exercise did not alter radiographic evidence of OA. However, micro-CT analysis indicated that exercise did not block lateral subchondral bone loss or trabecular bone loss in the metaphysis, but did block MIA-induced medial bone loss.
2:::A nested case-control study was carried out on a cohort of patients aged 85 years or older, who were newly treated with antihypertensive drugs between 2007 and 2009, using the database available for all citizens (about 10 million) of Lombardy (Italy). Cases were the cohort members who experienced death or hospital discharge for stroke, myocardial infarction (MI) or heart failure from the initial prescription until 2012. Up to five controls were randomly selected for each case. Logistic regression was used to model the outcome risk associated with the adherence with antihypertensive drug therapy. A patient cohort aged 70-84 years was taken for comparison.
4:::Based on our experience, specially trained anesthesiologists can provide efficient and safe perioperative care for patients with CIEDs. Other centers may consider implementing a similar strategy as our specialty adopts the perioperative surgical home model.
3:::AYA patients with cancer were found to have significantly worse social functioning scores around the time of diagnosis (52.0 vs 85.1; P<.001), at the 12-month follow-up (73.1 vs 85.1; P<.001), and at the 24-month follow-up (69.2 vs 85.1; P<.001) when compared with population norms. Significant improvements in social functioning from baseline to the 12-month follow-up were observed; however, social functioning levels remained stable thereafter. Among participants, 9% demonstrated consistently high/normal social functioning, 47% demonstrated improved social functioning, 13% were found to have worsening social functioning, and 32% demonstrated consistently low social functioning. AYA patients with cancer who had consistently low social functioning were more often off treatment at the time of follow-up, reported more physical symptoms and higher levels of distress at baseline and follow-up, and perceived less social support at baseline compared with the other 3 groups.
2:::Forty-six patients were randomized to receive the PMDI at either the anterior or posterior compartment, with the contralateral knee receiving the PMDI at the opposite compartment. The PMDI injected to the posterior capsule, medial and lateral meniscal remnant, was defined as the posterior compartment injection, whereas the injection to the medial retinaculum, quadriceps muscle, pes anserinus, and retropatellar fat pad was defined as the anterior compartment injection. Pain scores at rest, knee flexion angle, quadriceps function, and drainage blood loss were evaluated in both groups.
3:::Of the 114 patients, 16 (14.0%) had a malignancy already diagnosed at TTC, and further 11 patients received the diagnosis during follow up. Cancer patients had higher frequency of atrial fibrillation and lower hemoglobin levels at admission than patients without cancer. While the occurrence of in-hospital events was comparable, the diagnosis of cancer at TTC event or during follow up was predictive for a higher rate of the composite endpoint. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, malignant diseases were strongly associated not only with overall mortality but also with worsened time of event-free survival during the long-term outcome.
4:::Averaging of multiple en face OCTA images improves image quality and also significantly impacts quantitative measurements. Reducing noise that could be misinterpreted as flow and annealing discontinuous vessel segments seem to be major mechanisms by which averaging may be of benefit.
2:::Using the Netherlands Study group on CHoledochal Cyst/malformation (NeSCHoc) we retrospectively collected demographic, biochemical and surgical data from all Dutch patients with an antenatally detected CM.
3:::Few significant differences in attitudes and awareness of LGBT issues between government and non-government respondents were found. Nearly all respondents were supportive of LGBT persons irrespective of organizational context, with a small number of negative views. Although most respondents demonstrated awareness of organizational policies and practices relating to LGBT clients, many were ""unsure"" or ""neutral"" of what these might be.
2:::Parents of 165 toddlers with ASD, 58 nonverbal ability- and chronological age- (CA) matched developmentally delayed (DD) toddlers, and 92 CA-matched typically developing (TD) toddlers completed the Toddler Behavior Assessment Questionnaire-Supplemental (TBAQ-S) at 26 months (SD = 6; Time 1). TBAQ-S data were also available for a subset of toddlers with ASD (n = 126) at 43 months (SD = 9; Time 2).
3:::In 28 of 107 patients (26%), the surgical treatment plan remained unchanged after PET/CT. In 24 patients (22%), minor changes were performed, such as enlargement or reduction of the surgical field. In 55 patients (51%, 95% CI 42%-61%) major changes of the intended treatment plan occurred; of those, 20 patients (19%) were classified to be tumor-free with PET/CT, 32 patients (30%) were found to have multiple previously unrecognized metastases and had to be treated by systemic therapy, three patients (3%) had to be changed to palliative radiotherapy or isolated extremity perfusion. The 1-year and 2-year overall survival (OS) in patients with complete metastasectomy (N = 52) was 90% and 79%, respectively. Systemically treated patients (N = 32) resulted in 1-year OS of 72% and 2-year OS of 61%. Eleven of 32 patients (34%) with systemic therapy experienced a complete response. Until December 2016, all 20 patients classified as tumor-free by PET/CT were alive.
4:::The device appeared feasible and safe for about a third of our sample, for whom routine exoskeleton-assisted walking may offer secondary benefits.
3:::In immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray of PDAC specimens, increased levels of TPH1 and decreased level of MAOA, which regulate 5-HT synthesis and degradation, correlated with stage and size of PDACs and shorter patient survival time. We found levels of 5-HT to be increased in human PDAC tissues compared with non-tumor pancreatic tissues, and PDAC cell lines compared with non-transformed pancreatic cells. Incubation of PDAC cell lines with 5-HT increased proliferation and prevented apoptosis. Agonists of HTR2B, but not other 5-HT receptors, promoted proliferation and prevented apoptosis of PDAC cells. Knockdown of HTR2B in PDAC cells, or incubation of cells with HTR2B inhibitors, reduced their growth as xenograft tumors in mice. We observed a correlation between 5-HT and glycolytic flux in PDAC cells; levels of metabolic enzymes involved in glycolysis, the phosphate pentose pathway, and hexosamine biosynthesis pathway increased significantly in PDAC cells following 5-HT stimulation. 5-HT stimulation led to formation of the HTR2B-LYN-p85 complex, which increased PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling and the Warburg effect by increasing protein levels of MYC and HIF1A. Administration of SB204741 to KPC mice slowed growth and metabolism of established pancreatic tumors and prolonged survival of the mice.
2:::Seventy-six preoperative CT scans of LGMA patients were evaluated by two surgeons unfamiliar with the patients medical history. Scores were assigned based on SPAAT criteria, with a SPAAT ≥3 predictive of IC. Binary regression analyses and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve analyses were performed. Patients with splenic resection were excluded due to the structure of the SPAAT assessment tool.'
1:::The aim of this study was to gain insight in current pharmacovigilance educational activities and to gather information on which topics should be included in the undergraduate pharmacovigilance core curriculum.
3:::Among 110 assessed publications on RCTs, 80 (73%) adequately reported harm and 52% adequately reported its severity. Overall, 40% of the assessed manuscripts perfectly reported and discussed harm. The adequate reporting of harm was significantly associated with the type of trial (odds ratio [OR] 4.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.60-12.35 for multicenter compared with monocentric trials) and having a predefined method for collecting harm data (OR 5.93, 95% CI 2.26-15.56). Reporting of harm severity was better in pharmacologic trials (OR 6.48, 95% CI 2.00-21.0) compared with nonpharmacologic trials and in trials for which a method for collecting harm (OR 5.65, 95% CI 2.00-16.4) and its severity (OR 3.60, 95% CI 1.00-12.8) was defined before the study onset.
4:::Matching analysis revealed a significantly greater incidence of stroke in the HAR group but equivalent midterm outcomes in the hybrid group compared with the CTAR group.
2:::A questionnaire for identification and general data, a brief quality of life assessment (WHOQOL-brief), the scale of suicide ideation by Beck and the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview were used in this study. DNA was obtained using buccal mucosa swab samples, and genotyping was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. A total of 306 patients were assessed with MeDi; 161 patients had MeDi and a history of SA, and 145 patients had MeDi and no history of SA. The study had 175 subjects in the control group.
3:::Twelve hours after acoustic overstimulation, immune-related gene pathways such as ""chemokine signaling activity,"" ""cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction,"" and ""cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) in the immune system"" were significantly changed compared with the baseline level without noise. These DEGs were involved in immune and defense responses in the cochlea. Dexamethasone was administered to this NIHL model, and it modulated gene pathways of ""cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction"" and ""cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) in the immune system"" at 12 hours, compared with saline-injected control. Dexamethasone-dependent DEGs were also involved in immune and defense responses. A literature search showed that 10 other genes associated with hearing functions were regulated by dexamethasone both at 12 and 24 hours post-administration.
3:::A total of 2426 patients (75%) reported self-assessed emotional shock by the prostate cancer diagnosis. Median age of study participants was 63. There was an association between emotional shock and low psychological well-being after surgery: adjusted OR 1.7: (95% confidence interval [CI]), 1.4-2.1 at 3 months; adjusted OR 1.3: CI, 1.1-1.7 at 12 months, and adjusted OR 1.4: CI, 1.1-1.8 at 24 months. Among self-assessed emotionally shocked patients, low self-esteem, anxiety, and having no one to confide in were factors more strongly related with low psychological well-being over time.
2:::Interethnic comparison was conducted between cohorts of Caucasian and Chinese patients from specialist sleep disorder clinics. Polysomnography and craniofacial photography were performed. A low respiratory ArTH was determined by an ArTH score of 2 or above (one point for each: apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) < 30/h, nadir oxygen saturation (SaO2 ) > 82.5%, fractions of hypopnoeas > 58.3%). Anatomical compromise was stratified according to the photographic face width measurement.
3:::The mean preoperative MPTA was 2.9° varus, LDFA was 2.7° valgus, and overall HKA was 0.1° varus. Using our protocol, 2475 knees (51%) could have undergone KA without adjustment. To include 4062 cases (83%), mean corrections of 0.5° for MPTA and 0.3° for LDFA were needed, significantly less than with MA (3.3° for MPTA and 3.2° for LDFA; P < .001).
4:::Our survey provides a picture of NOE management in the UK. While there is consensus in some aspects of NOE management, other aspects attract widely differing answers. This may reflect the lack of strong evidence in the literature. Future work should aim to address this.
2:::This retrospective case-series study included 33 head and neck cancer patients whose cancer recurred despite receiving radiation therapy between April 2010 and April 2014. Clinico-biological data were collected the day patients were diagnosed as terminal. Bivariate correlation analyses were performed on survival times and clinico-biological data. For multivariate regression analyses, patients were divided into two groups: (1) patients who survived >120 days, and (2) those who survived <120 days. Group clinico-biological data were used to determine survival-time cutoff points for the prognosis index.
3:::Immunohistochemical studies revealed the expression of HK-1 in small- and medium-sized trigeminal ganglion neurons, in the paratrigeminal nucleus, and in lamina I of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, while there was no immunoreactivity of HK-1 in the trigeminal nucleus principalis, trigeminal nucleus oralis, and trigeminal nucleus interpolaris.
2:::We demonstrate the use of grid-aided, parafilm-assisted microdissection to perform MALDI MS imaging and shotgun proteomics and metabolomics in a combined workflow and using only a single tissue section. The grid is generated by microspotting acid dye 25 using a piezoelectric microspotter, and this grid was used as a guide to locate regions of interest and as an aid during manual microdissection. Subjecting the dissected pieces to the modified Folch method allows to separate the metabolites from proteins. The proteins can then be subjected to digestion under controlled conditions to improve protein identification yields.
3:::The proof of concept experiment on rat brain generated 162 and 140 metabolite assignments from three ROIs (cerebellum, hippocampus and midbrain/hypothalamus) in positive and negative modes, respectively, and 890, 1303 and 1059 unique proteins. Integrated metabolite and protein overrepresentation analysis identified pathways associated with the biological functions of each ROI, most of which were not identified when looking at the protein and metabolite lists individually.
4:::The results indicate that OsSARD1 plays an important role in the regulation of the defense responses to GR and IB irradiation and exhibits phytohormone induced expression.
2:::This study included 73 of 90 eligible patients who underwent arthroscopic repair of an anterosuperior massive RCT. Functional outcomes after 2-year follow-up were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, subjective shoulder value (SSV), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder score, and active range of motion. Patients were assigned to the healed group (group H, n = 34) or retear group (group R, n = 39) based on magnetic resonance arthrography results at 6 months postoperatively. Group R was composed of subgroup R1 (subscapularis retear) and subgroup R2 (intact subscapularis repair).
3:::Retearing occurred in 53% of patients. At 2-year follow-up, group H exhibited better outcomes for all functional scores versus group R, respectively ( P < .001): VAS pain score (1.0 vs 2.1), SSV (90.2 vs 77.4), ASES score (90.8 vs 76.6), and UCLA shoulder score (31.0 vs 24.9). Within both groups, all scores improved significantly compared with preoperative values ( P < .001). At follow-up, group H had significantly better forward flexion ( P = .018) and internal rotation ( P = .002) than group R; within both groups, active range of motion improved in all planes compared with the preoperative condition ( P < .001). Subgroup R1 exhibited inferior outcomes versus subgroup R2, respectively: VAS pain score (2.6 vs 1.5; P = .012), ASES score (70.9 vs 83.6; P = .013), SSV (70.9 vs 85.4; P = .005), and UCLA shoulder score (22.0 vs 28.5; P = .001).
1:::Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) and apolipoprotein B-100 (ApoB-100) are amphipathic proteins that are strong predictors of cardiovascular disease risk. The traceable calibration of apolipoprotein assays is a persistent challenge, especially for ApoB-100, which cannot be solubilized in purified form.
3:::We found that the incidence of allergic disease was lower among farmers compared to non-farmers' children during the 8-year follow-up period, and that farmers' children had higher proportions of memory B cells at 8 years of age. Moreover, a high proportion of neonatal CD5(+) B cells was a risk factor for and may predict development of allergic disease at 8 years of age. A high proportion of Tregs was not protective against development of these conditions.'
4:::FL factors rather than PL factors appear to contribute disproportionately to the underuse of TT in patients with nonmetastatic IBC. To improve treatment guideline adherence for patients with nonmetastatic IBC, it is critical to identify the specific FL factors associated with TT underuse. More organized FL intervention is required to train physicians and to build multidisciplinary teams. Cancer 2017;123:2618-25. © 2017 American Cancer Society.
2:::Between 1997 and 1999, 177 patients with proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-refractory GERD were randomized to CNF or LNF. Data regarding the presence of reflux symptoms, dysphagia, general health, PPI use, and need for surgical reintervention at 17 years are reported.
3:::A total of 111 patients (60 LNF, 51 CNF) were included. Seventeen years after LNF and CNF, 90% and 95% of the patients reported symptom relief, with no differences in GERD symptoms or dysphagia. Forty-three and 49% of the patients used PPIs (NS). Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in general health (77% vs 71%; NS) and quality of life (75.3 vs 74.7; NS). Surgical reinterventions were more frequent after CNF (18% vs 45%; P = 0.002), mainly due to incisional hernia corrections (3% vs 14%; P = 0.047).
2:::We studied 672 patients without overt coronary artery disease and normal myocardial perfusion on stress (82)Rb PET/CT imaging. To account for differences in baseline characteristics between diabetic patients and nondiabetic patients, we created a propensity score-matched cohort considering clinical variables and coronary risk factors.
3:::Before matching, diabetic patients had higher coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores (p < 0.001) and lower coronary flow reserve (CFR; p < 0.001) than nondiabetic patients. After matching, CAC scores were comparable between diabetic and nondiabetic patients, but diabetic patients still had lower hyperaemic myocardial blood flow (p < 0.001) and CFR (p < 0.05). Patients were categorized by ln(CAC score) quartiles. There was a decrease in CFR with increasing CAC score quartile in both diabetic patients (p for trend < 0.01) and nondiabetic patients (p for trend < 0.005). Diabetes was associated with lower CFR across quartile categories (p < 0.002). In a multivariable linear regression analysis, CAC score was inversely related to CFR in both diabetic patients (p < 0.05) and nondiabetic patients (p < 0.001).
4:::We linked a dietary VFM score and VFM to E. dolichum and four metabolites in the blood. In particular, the relationship between hippurate, a metabolite derived from microbial metabolism of dietary polyphenols, and reduced VFM, the microbiome and increased adipose tissue expression of neuroglobin provides potential mechanistic insight into the influence of diet on VFM.
3:::Both methods were found to be highly correlated. Unsupervised principal component analysis showed that the chemotherapy-responsive and -resistant B-ALL patients could be segregated from one another. Selection of segregated genes at high stringency identified two potential genes (CDH11 and ADAMTSL5). MSP analysis on the larger cohort of samples (42 chemoresponsive, 14 chemoresistant B-ALL samples and 6 normal controls) revealed significantly higher rates of hypermethylation in chemoresistant samples for ADAMTSL5 (93 vs. 38%; p = 0.0001) and CDH11 (79% vs. 40%, p < 0.01). All control cases remained unmethylated.
2:::We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who presented within 72hours from symptom onset of AP at our center between January 2014 and May 2015. Demographic parameters on admission, organ failure assessment, laboratory data and in-hospital mortality were compared between patients with and without POF. Uni-and multi-variate logistic regression analyses were utilized to evaluated the predictive ability of serum calcium.
4:::The characteristics of the TCGA BCa cohort include a high proportion of advanced tumors, but outcomes in major subgroups show concordance with previous series. Therefore, molecular data from this cohort can be considered representative of invasive BCa and serve as a valuable resource to validate prognostic biomarkers.
3:::Cardiac I/R injury aggravated brain oxidative stress, beta-amyloid production, and decreased dendritic spine density in either sham-operated or ovariectomized ND-fed rats, but not in ovariectomized HF-fed rats. Either estrogen or DPP-4 inhibitor therapies reduced those conditions in all rats with cardiac I/R.
2:::Two independent authors searched major databases until August 2016. A random effects meta-analysis was performed.
4:::The Nepal earthquakes resulted in a significant number of SCIs, the majority occurring in women. Incomplete paraplegia was the most common presentation. Pressure ulcer, the most frequent complication, primarily occurred before rehabilitation admission. Continued efforts focused on comprehensive planning, and preparedness for SCI-specific interdisciplinary care following earthquakes, particularly in resource-limited settings, is critical to ensuring survival, preventing complications and optimizing functional outcomes in this patient population.
3:::CMV resulted in loss of both MHCfast and MHCslow. Furthermore, the CSA of diaphragmatic muscle fibers was significantly decreased after 24 h of CMV. However, calpain inhibitor calpeptin prevented loss of MHC and CSA after CMV. In addition, calpeptin prevented the increase in protein expression of calpain1 and calpain2 and reduced calpain activity as indicated by reduced generation of the calpain cleavage product αII-spectrin in the diaphragm. CMV-induced upregulation of both MAFbx and MuRF1 protein levels was attenuated by treatment with calpeptin.
2:::miR-516a-5p was stably overexpressed and knocked down in VSMCs explant cultured from human abdominal aortic tissues by means of lentiviral system. The MTHFR protein expression was first examined by Western blotting. In addition, the protein expressions of several key components involved in AAA pathogenic features are as follows: matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 for elastin degradation; collagen type 1 alpha 1 for compensatory collagen synthesis; monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 for inflammation, were also evaluated. Apoptotic level of VSMCs was examined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay.
3:::There was no association between non-VA care and any-cause readmission. We did identify an increased COPD-specific readmission risk with both dual-care [odds ratio (OR)=1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.40] and Medicare-only (OR=1.41; 95% CI, 1.15-1.75). Medicare-only outpatient care was also associated with significantly lower rates of follow-up (OR=0.81; 95% CI, 0.72-0.91).
4:::Overall, these results suggest that although the lack of prior visual experience may not lead to impaired emotion processing performance, the underlying neurophysiological substrate (i.e., degree of special hemispheric lateralization) may depend on normal visual development. (PsycINFO Database Record
2:::Three thousand one hundred consecutive patients with navigated TKAs from 2001-2016 were retrospectively evaluated for complications specific to navigation. We discuss the 2 cases of postoperative fracture through tracker pin sites that we experienced and compare this systematically with the literature.
3:::Postoperatively, our 3100 patient cohort experienced a total of 2 fractures through pin sites for an incidence of 0.065%. One was a distal femoral fracture which was treated surgically, and the other was a proximal tibial fracture treated nonoperatively. Because of our incorporation of the tracker sites within our operative incision, there were no identifiable pin site infections, which others have noted at an incidence of 0.47%. Our 0.065% fracture rate compares favorably with the 0.16% rate of fracture published in the literature.
4:::Our findings provide partial support for the role of EF in mediating posttraumatic stress outcomes for youth exposed to complex trauma. This points to the important role of EF in the etiology and treatment of complexly traumatized youth.
3:::Both APP and NEP genes were up-regulated in periodontitis-affected gingival tissues. APP-expressing macrophages and NEP-expressing neutrophils and fibroblasts, reflecting inflammatory stages, were detected in inflamed gingival tissues by IHC.
2:::We reviewed prospectively collected data from the hospital arthroplasty database, identifying and reviewing all patients who had undergone an ETO at first-stage revision for infection, who had subsequently undergone second-stage reimplantation.
3:::A total of 1,748 patients having a median BMI of 28 (interquartile range 25-32) were evaluated. Benign masses and RCC cases had similar proportion across BMI groups (P = 0.4). The most common RCC subtype was clear cell followed by papillary carcinoma, chromophobe, and other subtypes. Their distribution was comparable across BMI groups (P = 0.7). Similarly, clinical stage distribution was comparable with the overall cohort. The distribution of Fuhrman grade in RCC, however, demonstrated an increased proportions of low grade with increasing BMI (P<0.05). This trend was maintained in subgroups according to gender, stage and age (P<0.05 in all subgroup analysis). In a multivariable model that included potential confounders (i.e., age, sex, and tumor size) higher BMI groups had lower odds of presenting a high Fuhrman grade.
4:::We emphasized that the persistent nasal carriage of A baumannii in LTCFs could be another portal of exit to cause A baumannii infection in Taiwan.
2:::In a sub-study of the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS trial), BNP and BigET-1 were measured at baseline and at 1month in 476 patients.
3:::Of 47 617 evaluated infants, 9317 (19.6%) were born during off-peak hours. The frequencies of all study outcomes were higher among infants born during off-peak compared with peak hours. After adjusting for maternal, infant, and hospital characteristics, off-peak hour delivery was associated with increased odds of severe intraventricular hemorrhage among survivors (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.23-1.57) and the composite outcomes of death or severe intraventricular hemorrhage (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07-1.25) and death or major morbidity (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.15). There was no evidence of subgroup effects based on delivery mode, birth hospital neonatal intensive care level or annual very low birth weight infant delivery volume, or weekday vs weekend off-peak hour delivery for any study outcome.
4:::Each group demonstrated at-risk behaviors for obesity. Future programs should consider after-school schedules and use activity and meal pattern assessments, not simply weight status, for program tailoring.
3:::Periodontal probing depths and bone levels on the distal surfaces of adjacent mandibular molars showed marked improvement compared with preoperative probing depths and bone levels. All retained roots maintained their immediate postoperative positions with no migrations and no reoperations required.
1:::To determine the effects of different polychemotherapy drugs on cortical bone structure, the femur diaphysis of rats were treated with two different chemotherapy drugs, AC (doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide) and TC (docetaxel + cyclophosphamide), and evaluated by 3D morphological analysis using synchrotron radiation microtomography.
2:::Fifty-two participants with peripheral visual field loss undertook binocular assessment of visual fields using the 30-2 and 60-4 SITA Fast programs on the Humphrey Field Analyser, and mean thresholds were derived. Binocular visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and near reading performance were also determined. Self-reported overall and mobility function were assessed using the Dutch ICF Activity Inventory.
3:::Characteristics associated with higher initial levels of sleep disturbance included higher body mass index, poorer functional status, higher trait anxiety, higher depressive symptoms, and higher evening fatigue. Characteristics associated with the worse trajectories of sleep disturbance were higher levels of education and higher sleep disturbance at enrollment. Characteristics associated with both higher initial levels and worse trajectories of sleep disturbance were higher morning fatigue and worse attentional function.
4:::For the first time, we have clarified the detailed long-term survival outcomes of LPPG for cT1 N0 GC. LPPG is an acceptable and favorable operative method for clinically diagnosed early-stage GC, in terms of long-term survival and postoperative nutrition.
3:::Almost 13% of respondents reported being very worried or worried about getting AD/dementia, with women more worried than men (p<.001), and AD/dementia caregivers more worried than other types of caregivers (p=.04). Women were also more likely than men to agree to be screened/tested if experiencing changes in memory and/or thinking (p<.001). The greater the worry, the more likely respondents would agree to be screened/tested (p<.001). Nearly 66% of respondents were concerned that sharing a diagnosis would change the way others think/feel about them, with women reporting greater concern than men (p=.003).
2:::A 52-year-old woman with a 2.5-cm extraparenchymal, saccular, symptomatic left renal artery aneurysm underwent self-expanding stent-assisted detachable platinum microcoil embolization.
3:::A total of 14 patients were diagnosed with MF. The ratio of boys to girls was 1:1.33. The mean age at diagnosis was 11.23 years (range, 8-15 years). The mean time between onset and diagnosis was 3.5 years (range, 4 months-7 years). All patients had hypopigmented MF and 42% also presented the features of classic MF. Seven (50%) had the CD8(+) immunophenotype exclusively. Seventy-eight percent were in stage IB at presentation. Phototherapy was the treatment of choice. Four patients relapsed at least once and skin lesions progressed in 3 patients. All patients improved.
4:::The GAD-7, SHAI, Mini-SPIN, OCI-R, PSWQ-A and PHQ-9 are recommended for evaluation of psychological problems for patients seeking help for tinnitus and/or hyperacusis. Abnormal results on these questionnaires may indicate the need for referral for possible treatment of psychological problems.
3:::We show that in the MPH condition, subjects increased grip force throughout but not during pretask failure. Brain connectivity was altered throughout the task between the insular and the hand motor cortex, as well as between the insular and the orbital frontal cortex. There were no differences in connectivity during pretask failure.
2:::Ultrasound-guided bilateral TQL and TOP TQL injections were administered in 8 cadavers. A total of 16 injections were performed. With the TQL injection, the curvilinear transducer was oriented in the transverse plane above the iliac crest at the posterior axillary line to identify the Shamrock sign. With the TOP TQL injection, the same transducer was placed with a TOP orientation 3 cm lateral to the L2 spinous process to identify the L2 transverse process and the adjoining quadratus lumborum muscle. For both techniques, the needle was advanced in-plane to the transducer, with the end point in the interfascial plane between the quadratus lumborum and psoas major muscles. Thirty milliliters of dye solution was injected bilaterally for each technique. The spread of the dye was evaluated by subsequent dissection.
4:::These findings provide preliminary insight into the psychosocial profile of adults at risk for nonadherence due to their responses to arthritis pain.
3:::The analysis included 438,811 adults. Larger change of BP accompanied with unit change of average outdoor temperature among outpatient than inpatient patients. The association of temperature with BP was stronger in normotensives than that in hypertensives. Compared with temperature variation, the impact of temperature maintenance on BP was smaller. These associations were stronger in men, older individuals.
2:::A random sample of Australian GP was invited to complete a postal survey, which assessed familiarity with and use of contemporary practice guidelines, diagnostic criteria and management preferences for COPD.
1:::Rotator cuff reconstruction using arthroscopic double-row technique enables a better repair of the anatomical footprint at the tendon insertion. Objective of this serial study was to illustrate structural and functional results during recovery following double-row reconstruction.
3:::After 26 weeks, the Constant score (CS) showed a highly significant increase for the first time with a value of 78 (p < 0.001). Tendon integration according to Sugaya showed a left shift over time, with higher CS-values for lower Sugaya classifications. Significant improvements in strength were first measured between the 26-week and 52-week follow-ups (9->19/p < 0.001). Highly significant improvement (p < 0.001) of the tendon signal and the fatty infiltration was found in the same time interval. The hypotrophy showed slight improvement, while a highly significant reduction of the bone marrow edema was found between weeks 12 and 26 (p < 0.001). There were no re-ruptures after week 26.
4:::Aortic diameter and graft oversizing appear to be independent risk factors for early aortic neck dilatation. EndoAnchors have a protective effect on neck dilatation at their usual level of deployment.
2:::We performed a single-center study including 398 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI. Before TAVI, patients were divided into a sinus rhythm (SR) group (n=226, 57%) and baseline AF group (n=172, 43%) according to clinical records and electrocardiograms. Furthermore, incidence and predictors of NOAF were recorded.
3:::A total of 905 patients were included. Flame (38%) and Scald (59%) burns were the most common mechanism. More burns occurred during the cold season (41% vs 19-20% in the other seasons). Overall mortality was 19%. Only the cold season had a statistically significant increase in burn . The incidence rate ratios (IRR) for the hot, lush, and cold seasons were 0.94 (CI 0.6-1.32), 1.02 (CI 0.72-1.45) and 1.6 (CI 1.17-2.19), respectively, when compared to the rainy season. Burn severity and mortality did not differ between seasons.
3:::Between 2002 and 2013, 66 children with AIH were identified (mean age at diagnosis 9.6 ± 5.1 years) with a mean follow-up period of 2.9 ± 3.2 years. Common presenting symptoms included jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain. The majority of subjects received steroids for induction and AZA for maintenance of remission. Seventy-nine percent achieved biochemical remission (mean time to remission 6.2 ± 9.2 months), 14% were in the induction phase of therapy, 6% required liver transplantation, and 18% were weaned off immunosuppression and remained in remission. 6-TGN levels ranging from 50 to 250 pmol/8 × 10 red blood cell count were associated with biochemical remission (alanine aminotransferase levels of ≤50 U/L).
4:::The vast majority of children with AIH maintain a sustained remission with AZA monotherapy. Biochemical remission was maintained with 6-TGN levels much lower than that recommended for inflammatory bowel disease. These findings suggest that patients should be maintained at the lowest AZA dose possible that is associated with biochemical remission.
2:::In the past 13 years, we have prefabricated 20 flaps in 20 patients by the superficial temporal artery and its concomitant veins. Typically, a 50- to 800-mL tissue expander was implanted in the donor site. After flap maturation, the prefabricated flap was raised and transferred locally to cover the large defect on the face. All the cases were followed up regularly.
3:::First, Matrigel produced a greater heat retention (less heat sink) effect than D5W during ex vivo ablation (63 ± 9 vs. 26 ± 6 °C at 1 min on the surface of the liver, P < 0.001). Hepatic ablation zone volume did not differ between the two groups. Second, thermal injury to the nearby structures was found in 14 of 15 cases (93.3%) in the control group, 8 of 15 cases (53.3%) in the D5W group, and 1 of 15 cases (6.7%) in the Matrigel group. Significant differences in the thermal injury rates for nearby structures were detected among the three groups (P < 0.001). The most significant difference in the thermal injury rate was found in locations near the GI tract (P = 0.003). Finally, Matrigel that was injected in vivo was gradually degraded during the following 60 days.
2:::Plasma from 250 hip fracture patients aged ≥65 years sampled at hospital admission were analysed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods for detection of psychotropic drugs and weak opioid analgesics (alcohol also determined). Odds ratios for drugs detected in plasma of hip fracture patients vs. prescription frequencies of the same drugs in an age-, time- and region-matched reference population were calculated. Moreover, recorded and measured drugs were compared.
4:::The readability level of Spanish informed consent forms must be improved because their scores using readability tools could not be classified in normal scales. Furthermore, there was very wide variability among Spanish ICF, which showed a lack of equity in information access among Spanish citizens.
3:::A total of 411 patients were investigated. OAB was detected in 207 (50.4%) patients, other causes for the lower urinary tract symptoms were detected in 63 (15.3%), and 141 (34.3%) patients had no diagnosis. The voiding diary suggested OAB in 197 (47.9%) patients. The correlation between the clinical diagnosis and the diagnosis based on the voiding diary was .702. The correlation between the clinical diagnosis and B-SAQ, OAB-V8 and OAB-V3 was .59, .673 and .732, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) was .799 for B-SAQ; .837 for OAB-V8 and .867 for OAB-V3 (OAB-V3 vs. OAB-V8, P=.02; OAB-V3 vs. B-SAQ, P<.0001). The AUC for the voiding diary was .852 (OAB-V3 vs. diary, P=.47).
3:::The 61 healthy patients had a mean age of 33 ± 9 years, and 59% were women. Of the total 366 aortic arch wall segments, 344 (94%) had adequate waveforms for the speckle tracking analysis. The hypertensive patients had a mean age of 45 ± 12 years, and 54% were women. Of the total 276 aortic wall segments, 261 (95%) had adequate waveforms for analysis. Aortic arch strain and strain rate were lower in the hypertensive patients group than in the healthy patients group (6.3 ± 2.0 vs. 11.2 ± 3.2% and 1.0 ± 0.3 vs. 1.5 ± 0.4 s, respectively, both P < 0.01). Aortic arch strain and strain were correlated with age (r = -0.62, r = -0.54; P < 0.01), pulse pressure (r = -0.48, r = -0.39; P < 0.01) and the pulse wave velocity (r = -0.57, r = -0.54; P < 0.01). After adjustments for age, sex and BMI, strain was significantly lower in hypertensive patients, when compared with healthy patients.
2:::We conducted a retrospective study. The primary endpoint was ICU mortality. Resumption of anticancer therapy in patients who survived the ICU stay and 90-day mortality were secondary endpoints. All patients aged ≥65 years admitted to the ICU of Georges Pompidou Hospital (Paris, France) between 2009 and 2014 were eligible.
1:::Detailed cancer treatment information is important to fertility and pregnancy care of female young adult cancer survivors. Accuracy of self-report of treatments that impact fertility and pregnancy is unknown. This study assessed agreement between self-report and medical records on receipt of fertility-threatening treatments.
4:::Female young adult cancer survivors have limited recall of fertility-threatening cancer treatment exposures. Reproductive health providers and researchers who need this information may require primary medical records or treatment summaries.
3:::The optimal MTVWB cut-point was 29.2 mL for the risk-stratification of stage IIIA. We identified statistically significant differences in OS between stage IIB and IIIA patients (p < 0.01), between IIIA and IIIB patients (p < 0.01), and between the stage IIIA patients with low MTVWB (below 29.2 mL) and the stage IIIA patients with high MTVWB (above 29.2 mL) (p < 0.01). There was no OS difference between the low MTVWB stage IIIA and the cohort of stage IIB patients (p = 0.485), or between the high MTVWB stage IIIA patients and the cohort of stage IIIB patients (p = 0.459). Similar risk-stratification capacity of MTVWB was observed in a large range of cutoff values from 15 to 55 mL in stage IIIA patients.
2:::We included 2213 participants (51% men, mean ± SD age = 60.0 ± 8.1 yr) of the Maastricht Study who were asked to wear an accelerometer 24 h·d for a week. We calculated daily sedentary, standing, and stepping time. An isotemporal substitution modeling approach was applied to examine effects on waist circumference; body mass index; cholesterol, triacylglycerol, glucose, and insulin levels; metabolic syndrome; and type 2 diabetes.
3:::Reader agreement identified dose levels lower than 50% and 4% to have inadequate performance for detection of hepatic metastases and pulmonary nodules, respectively, but could not exclude any low dose levels for head CT. Estimated differences in jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figures of merit between routine and lower dose configurations found that only the lowest dose configurations tested (ie, 30%, 4%, and 10% of routine dose levels for abdominal, chest, and head CT examinations, respectively) did not meet criteria for noninferiority. At lower doses, subjective image quality declined before observer performance. Iterative reconstruction was only beneficial when filtered back projection did not result in noninferior performance.
4:::Our study shows that patients with aseptic meningitis undergo improvement in all parameters of headache and also in signs of meningeal irritation following LP. Higher BMI and low headache intensity are positive prognostic factors for improvement of headache after 24hours while papilledema is associated with a higher incidence of PDPH.
3:::AYAs and parent carers expressed high total need for clinical services during treatment. Leading AYA unmet needs were for an exercise therapist (37%), genetic counsellor (30%), dietitian (26%), peer support group (26%) and educational and vocational advisor (24%). After treatment, AYAs and parents had fewer total needs. However, 60% of AYA and 38% of parents had two or more unmet needs, similar to during treatment. Female gender and receiving treatment in an adult setting were significantly associated with unmet need for clinical services. After treatment, higher distress levels in AYAs and parents were associated with two or more unmet service needs.
2:::Thirty-four patients with HBV-related advanced HCC (modified Union for International Cancer Control [UICC] stage IVa or IVb) treated with sorafenib for more than 4weeks were retrospectively enrolled. Using a Luminex 200 system, 11 cytokines including interleukin-17A (IL-17A) were measured in baseline serum samples prior to sorafenib administration. Several clinical factors and the serum concentrations of the 11 cytokines were analyzed using Cox regression analysis.
3:::RFCA successfully terminated AT in the RA in 13 of 28 patients (46.4%), in the LA in 4 of 16 patients (25.0%), and in the NCC in 46 of 52 patients (88.5%) after 1 procedure (P < .05). Atrioventricular block occurred only during RFCA in the RA in 4 of 28 patients (14.3%). After a mean follow-up of 33.5 ± 25.4 months, AT recurrence was observed in 5 of 13 patients (38.5%) ablated in the RA, 1 of 4 (25.0%) ablated in the LA, and 2 of 46 (4.4%) ablated in the NCC (P < .05). RFCA in the LA was effective only if the local activation time (LAT) was earlier than that in the RA. RFCA in the NCC was successful regardless of the LAT (P < .05).
2:::Pilot study (n=188) conducted in 2015-2016 in Madrid and León (Spain) by recruiting subjects affected by two types of fraud (preferred shares and foreign currency mortgages) using venue-based sampling. Information on the monetary value of each case of fraud; the dates when subjects became aware of being swindled, lodged legal claim and received financial compensation were collected. Inter-group comparisons of the prevalence of poor physical and mental health, sleep and quality of life were carried according to type of fraud and the 2011-2012 National Health Survey.
4:::Regional heterogeneity in cortical bone micro-architecture could not fully explain increased fragility of the mid-facial skeleton at the Le Fort lines. However, regional differences in trabecular bone anisotropy may contribute to increased bone fragility.
3:::Claron could not segment the spleen in four subjects for the first reader and in two subjects for the second reader. The final mean segmentation times for the liver for both readers were 6.5 and 5.5 minutes for AWS, 4.4 and 3.6 minutes for Claron, and 5.1 and 4.2 minutes for Vitrea. The final mean segmentation times for the spleen were 2.7 and 2.1 minutes for AWS, 2.1 and 1.4 minutes for Claron, and 1.8 and 1.2 minutes for Vitrea. No statistically significant difference was found between the organ volumes measured by the two readers when using Vitrea. The mean differences between the initial and final segmentation volumes ranged from -1.2% to 0.4% for the liver and from -4.0% to 9.8% for the spleen. The mean differences between the automated liver segmentation volumes and the AWS volumes were 2.5%-2.9% for Claron and 4.9%-6.6% for Vitrea. The mean differences between the automated splenic segmentation volumes and the AWS volumes were 5.0%-6.2% for Claron and 10.6%-12.0% for Vitrea.
1:::To evaluate the association between functional status based on a geriatric assessment (GA) and outcomes of tolerance to treatment in patients with lung or head and neck cancer receiving radiation therapy (RT) or chemoradiation (CRT).
3:::Histopathological analysis indicated papillary carcinoma in 362 (92.1%) subjects and follicular carcinoma in 31 (7.9%) subjects. Three hundred and twenty-four (82.4%) of our cases were females, and 69 (17.6%) were males. Recurrence occurred in 82 (20.9%) of the subjects. Relapse was significantly more frequently observed in subjects with ASTg ≥ 2 ng/ml; and LSTg ≥ 2 ng/ml. (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively). In subjects negative for thyroglobulin antibodies (Tg-ab), an ASTg value ≥5.6 ng/ml was established to increase the risk of recurrence by 2.38-fold (p = 0.002), whereas an LSTg ≥ 0.285 ng/ml increased the risk of relapse by 3.087-fold (p < 0.001).
4:::It was observed that the concentrated growth factor had positive effects on implant stabilization. The ISQ measurements at week 1 and week 4 were notably higher in the study group. Application of this material seems to accelerate osseointegration.
2:::A search was performed of the Scottish Trauma Audit Group database for any patient with relevant injuries over a 2-year period. Primary outcome measures were time to CT and emergency surgery. Patient demographics were also recorded.
3:::There were 29 patients with a median age of 24 (range 9-37 years), 9 in active and 20 in inactive phase. Seventeen patients underwent a variety of bypass procedures. Fourteen endovascular procedures were performed in 12 patients. No death occurred within 30 days after both procedures. Complications within 30 days after bypass included stroke in 1 patient, infection in 2 patients, and heart failure in 1 patient. Nine patients developed brain hyperperfusion after bypass. Transient hemiplegic paralysis occurred in 1 patient during dilation of the carotid artery. During a median follow-up time of 41 months, primary and secondary patency rate of bypass at 1 and 3 years was 93.75% and 100% and 87.5% and 100%, respectively. Assisted primary and secondary patency rate of endovascular treatment at 1 and 3 years was 85.71% and 92.86% and 68.18% and 75.66%, respectively. There was no independent risk factor associated with either primary patency of surgical treatment or assisted primary patency of endovascular treatment. Disease activity was independent risk factor associated with combined rate of primary patency of surgical treatment and assisted primary patency of endovascular treatment (HR: 0.17, 95% CI: 0.03-0.93, P = 0.04).
4:::SHR is a useful predictive marker of MACCE after PCI, especially in non-diabetic patients with STEMI, which could be utilized to identify high-risk patients for adverse outcomes.
3:::The statistically significant prognostic factors for all groups of patients at both, univariate and multivariate analysis, were the GS and the iPSA. In intermediate- and high- or very-high-risk patients at multivariate analysis other prognostic factors for CSS were positive nodes on computed tomography (CT) scan and rectal preparation during the treatment; for BDFS, the prognostic factors were patient risk classification, positive lymph nodes on CT scan and rectal/bladder preparation; for CDFS, the prognostic factors were the number of positive core on biopsy (P=0.003), positive lymph nodes on CT scan, and radiotherapy (RT) dose. In high/very-high risk patient group at multivariate analysis other prognostic factors for CSS were clinical/radiological stage and RT dose, for BDFS they were adjuvant hormone therapy, clinical/radiological stage, and RT dose >77.7 Gy, and for CDFS they were clinical/radiological stage and RT dose >77.7 Gy.
2:::Data from 639 participants (mean age = 66.14, SD = 7.26) in 2000 with 6 years of follow-up were studied. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. Exercise and the APOE genotype were also assessed at baseline. Negative binomial regression models were conducted to examine the combined effects of exercise and APOE-e4 status on subsequent depressive symptoms when controlling for baseline depressive symptoms and other covariates. Sensitivity analyses to test for confounding, reverse causality, and attrition were conducted.
3:::Participants (n=52) completed 1,080 recalls on weekdays and 786 on weekends. Seventy-five percent of women reported consuming more energy on weekends than on weekdays, with a higher mean intake of 158 kcal on weekends (P<0.01). The percentage of energy from carbohydrate (P<0.01) and protein (P<0.01) were both lower on weekends, and percentage of energy from alcohol higher (P<0.01). There was no difference in the percentage of energy from fat (P=0.07). Reported energy intake was greatest on Saturdays and lowest on Tuesdays. On weekends, women had reduced diet quality with more alcoholic beverages, solid fat, and potatoes, and less yogurt, whole fruits, dark green and orange vegetables, poultry, nuts and seeds, and whole grains per 1,000 kcal than on weekdays. HEI-2010 scores were lower on weekends than weekdays (P<0.01). Component scores were lower for whole fruits (P<0.01), greens and beans (P=0.02), whole grains (P<0.01), and dairy (P<0.01).
4:::Midlife women should be encouraged to maintain diet quality during weekends to improve overall diet quality scores.
3:::One hundred twenty-eight out of two hundred four (62.7%) patients had a past history of major osteoporotic fracture and therefore had an indication of treatment based on guidelines. Among these patients, only 43/128 (33.5%) had received anti-osteoporotic treatment as secondary prevention after the initial fracture. The main causes of non-prescription identified were the attending physicians ignorance of the indication of treatment (n = 30; 35.3%), ignorance of the fracture (n = 17; 20%), and comorbidities (n = 12; 14.1%). The failure to introduce treatment was associated with the presence of comorbidities with a Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥6 (OR = 0.34 [0.16-0.73], p < 0.05), dementia (OR = 0.23 [0.08-0.72], p < 0.05), and past history of proximal femur fracture (OR = 0.20 [0.04-0.91], p < 0.05).'
2:::Patients who underwent elective surgery, with curative intent, for colorectal cancer at a single center between 2008 and 2016 were included (n = 556) in this study. Data on the use of preoperative dexamethasone were obtained from anesthetic records, and its impact on CRP on postoperative days (PODs) 3 and 4, as well as postoperative complications, was assessed using propensity score matching (n = 276).
4:::IMU-assisted implantation of pedicle screws may enhance the performance of a freehand technique in the thoracic and lumbosacral spine.
1:::Conventional teaching regarding palatal injection for the removal of maxillary teeth dictates the administration of buccal and palatal injections. Recently, some investigators have questioned the necessity of the palatal injection, suggesting that contemporary local anesthetics might diffuse sufficiently across the buccopalatal cortical bone distance. It has been suggested that because the buccopalatal cortical bone distance increases anteriorly to posteriorly in the maxilla, the success of maxillary extractions with buccal injection only might be related to the anteroposterior position of the tooth. Evidence from clinical trials has only recently become available. Since 2006, 15 clinical trials that examined outcomes of maxillary tooth extractions performed with buccal injection of local anesthetic only have been published. However, there are limited data available on the clinical practice of surgeons.
3:::In males, skin AF was significantly associated with age, coffee intake, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body fat, full fat dairy, and educational level. In females, significant associations were found with age, coffee intake, HbA1c , diabetes, and eGFR. In the total population, current smoking was positively associated with skin AF.
2:::The clinical features of cutaneous lesions of leishmaniasis diagnosed between 1987 and 2016 at Bellvitge Hospital in Barcelona, Spain, were retrospectively analyzed.
3:::The median age of the patients was 73 years, 63.4% were male, and more than 40% of patients had heart disease and hypertension. Overall, the survival analysis showed that 111 (55%) patients died with a survival median of 39 days (95% CI 30.7; 47.2). The genetic analysis association with survival was performed under a recessive genetic model (CC vs. GG/CG). Patients with IL-6 rs1800795 CC genotype had higher mortality rate than the IL-6 rs1800795 GG/CG genotype at days 7 [31.6% (6/19) vs. 10.4% (19/183); log-rank test (p = 0.005)] and 28 [57.9% (11/19) vs. 33.3% (61/183); log-rank test (p = 0.009)], and 90 [68.4% (13/19) vs. 53.5% (98/183); log-rank test (p = 0.006)]. The IL-6 rs1800795 CC genotype was associated with higher risk of septic shock-related death during the first 7 days [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR 4.65; p = 0.002), 28 days (aHR 2.50; p = 0.006), and 90 days (aHR 2.28; p = 0.006)] with septic shock. When patients were stratified by type of surgery, those with IL-6 rs1800795 CC genotype who underwent cardiac surgery had higher risk of death during the first 7 days (aHR 18.39; p = 0.001) and 28 days (aHR 6.1; p = 0.025) than IL-6 rs1800795 GG/GC carrier, whereas patients with IL-6 rs1800795 CC genotype who underwent abdominal surgery had higher risk of death during all follow-up (aHR 1.98; p = 0.050) than IL-6 rs1800795 GG/GC carrier.
4:::The 1-mg DST at its lowest threshold presented high sensitivity in identifying CS, but its low specificity encourages us to consider UFC levels, measured with LC-MS/MS, to reduce false-positive test results. High UFC levels could also be considered as markers to stratify cardiovascular risk in patients with adrenal incidentaloma.
2:::We retrospectively analyzed GeneChip microarray data from 22 of 47 patients included in the study.
1:::Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an effective therapy in patients with a somatostatin receptor-positive neuroendocrine tumour (NET). Still unclear is how many cycles of (177)Lu-octreotate can be repeated while maintaining an acceptable toxicity profile. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of repeated PRRT in patients with recurrent NET.
3:::Baseline scores indicated mild physical limitation (74±0.4), moderate angina stability (44±0.4), modest angina frequency (68±0.4), excellent treatment satisfaction (92±0.2) and moderate impairment of quality of life (55±0.3). Compared with standard care alone, CTCA was associated with less marked improvements in physical limitation (difference -1.74 (95% CIs, -3.34 to -0.14), p=0.0329), angina frequency (difference -1.55 (-2.85 to -0.25), p=0.0198) and quality of life (difference -3.48 (-4.95 to -2.01), p<0.0001) at 6 months. For patients undergoing CTCA, improvements in symptoms were greatest in those diagnosed with normal coronary arteries or who had their preventative therapy discontinued, and least in those with moderate non-obstructive disease or had a new prescription of preventative therapy (p<0.001 for all).
4:::A small number of participants, short study period, selection bias, and the Hawthorne effect may have limited measured impact in this study. The findings implied that visit nonadherence among frequently nonadherent individuals is largely unrelated to inconvenience.
2:::23 motor subacute and chronic incomplete SCI American Spinal Cord Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) D subjects were measured. The 10-meter walking test (10 MWT), 6-minute walking test (6 MWT), Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury II (WISCI-II), Spinal Cord Independence Measure III (SCIM-III) and the GaitRite evaluation were carried out concurrently in order to determine validity. The 10 MWT and GaitRite evaluation were performed at different occasions in order to determine test-retest reliability.
3:::The clonal selection allowed to isolate cells with a higher multi-differentiation potential, but at the same time a lower proliferation rate in comparison to the whole population. Moreover, the clones express a higher amounts of stemness marker OCT4 and tendon specific transcription factor Scleraxis (SCX) mRNA, but a lower level of decorin (DCN). On the other hand, the number of cells obtained by clonal selection was extremely low and most of the clones were unable to reach a high number of passages in cultures. The presence of bFGF influences TCs morphology, enhance their proliferation rate and reduce their clonogenic ability. Interestingly, the expression of CD54, a known mesenchymal stem cell marker, is reduced in presence of bFGF at early passages. Nevertheless, bFGF does not affect the chondrogenic and osteogenic potential of TCs and the expression of tendon specific markers, while it was able to downregulate the OCT4 expression.
3:::Three qualitatively and quantitatively similar clusters emerged within each clinical group: a severely impaired cluster, a mild-moderately impaired cluster and a relatively intact cognitive cluster. A cross-diagnostic clustering solution also resulted in three subgroups and was superior in reducing cognitive heterogeneity compared with disorder clustering independently.
2:::A retrospective, population-based analysis was performed on all hospital admissions of AYA oncology patients in California during 1991 through 2014 (n = 127,250) using the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development database. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined the contribution of social and clinical factors on always receiving care from an SCC (vs sometimes or never). Results are presented as adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
4:::Tattooed skin generated less sweat and a higher Na concentration than nontattooed skin when stimulated by pilocarpine iontophoresis.
3:::The profiles of the Corni fructus and Crataegi fructus samples were clearly clustered into two categories. The limit of quantification (LOQ) in the semi-quantitative analysis was 6 μg/mL and 5.6 μg/mL for loganin and morroniside, respectively.
2:::Between October 2000 and June 2014, 40 patients (33 men, mean age 65 [range 35-87] years) with type B AD underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) during the subacute phase (defined as 15-90 days from the onset of symptoms). Indications for intervention were acute aortic enlargement, resistant hypertension, and/or intractable pain. The primary outcome was survival. Secondary outcome measures included reinterventions and aortic remodeling (i.e., the fate of the false lumen [FL] post-TEVAR, which was classified as complete, partial, or no thrombosis of the FL).
4:::TEVAR for subacute type B AD appears to be associated with acceptable perioperative and long-term results. In contrast to previous reports, there is still a risk for postoperative retrograde type A AD even when patients are treated in the subacute phase when the aorta is less fragile. Aortic remodeling occurs in the majority of patients, but requires frequent aortic reinterventions, an observation that underlines the need for life-long surveillance.
3:::A total of 32 unique intervention studies were included. Most targeted primary care or cancer patients and used a randomized controlled study design. Interventions used a variety of training formats and modes of delivering educational material. Reported findings suggest that communication training is an effective approach to increase patients total level of active participation in healthcare interactions and that some communication behaviors may be more amenable to training (e.g., expressing concerns). Trained patients do not have longer visits and tend to receive more information from their providers. Most studies have found no relationship between communication training and improved health, psychosocial wellbeing, or treatment-related outcomes.'
2:::A retrospective review was conducted on 166 hydrocephalic paediatric patients shunted for the first time between 2000 and 2014. An analysis was made of the statistical relationships between first shunt failure and the demographic, aetiological, surgical and clinical variables.
3:::During approximately 1.6 million person years (py), 2371 breast cancer cases were diagnosed in the diabetes cohort (n=147,998) and 2252 in the reference cohort (n=147,998). Incidence of breast cancer, overall or by age groups, among women with diabetes remained stable over time. The (overall) age-standardized breast cancer IR per 100,000 py of the diabetes cohort (150, 95%CI:143-157) resembled that observed in the reference cohort (148, 95%CI:141-156); with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 1.01 (95%CI:0.94-1.08, p>0.05).
4:::Preterm-born German adolescents remained significantly shorter, lighter, and had a smaller head circumference than term-born adolescents, but the risk indicators for cardiovascular diseases were not higher.
1:::Patients with advanced cancer have increased life expectancy but suffer from ongoing burden. Depressive symptomatology is their most common mental health concern. The Ottawa Palliative Rehabilitation Program (PRP) offers rehabilitation for this population. It offers 8 weeks of individualized interdisciplinary rehabilitation, post cancer treatment. Interventions include medical (physician and nurse), physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietary, and social work using a general self-efficacy framework. Pilot data suggest benefits in a range of domains, including ratings of feeling ""depressed."" We examined whether reduced symptomatology was maintained 3 months after PRP completion.
2:::Using the residuals from a regression model of the global item of Lehmans 20-item quality of life interview (QOLI-20), latent trajectory analysis was used to identify response shift, while a measure of overall variability in residuals identified random variation of QOL. The latter was used to adjust group comparisons of QOLI-20 total scores and the global item.'
3:::Equivalent distributions of both groups participants across latent trajectory classes (χ(2) = 2.97, p = .397) suggest that the intervention did not trigger response shift. However, random variation interacted significantly with the treatment effect on global item ratings. For every increase of one standard deviation of residuals, treatment odds ratios decreased by a factor of 0.70 (SE 1.18, p = .036, 95% CI 0.50-0.98).'
2:::We performed a retrospective analysis of the CFTR2 and UK CF databases for clinical phenotype, sweat chloride values and CFTR mutations and compared the diagnostic characteristics of Asian to non-Asian patients with CF.
3:::Asian patients with CF do not have a worse clinical phenotype. The repeatedly reported lower FEV1 of Asian patients with CF is attributable to the influence of ethnicity on lung function in general. However, pancreatic sufficiency is more common in Asian patients with CF. The diagnosis of CF in people with Asian ancestry is heterogeneous as mean sweat chloride values are lower (92±26 versus 99±22mmol/L in controls) and 14% have sweat chloride values below 60mmol/L (versus 6% in non-Asians). Also, CFTR mutations differ from those in Caucasians: 55% of British Asian patients with CF do not have one mutation included in the routine newborn screening panel.
4:::Patients in facilities routinely initiating hemodialysis therapy for ≥ 4 hours may have substantially lower mortality as compared with patients in facilities initiating for only 3 hours of treatment.
3:::Median follow-up was 8.3 years. Median renal survival was 13.7 years and the probability of a 50% decline in eGFR was 13% over 10 years. Nine children exhibited the primary outcome and 4 developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Compared with C4d-negative patients (n = 10), C4d-positive patients (n = 37) presented higher baseline proteinuria (1.66 ± 0.68 vs 0.47 ± 0.19 g/day/1.73 m(2), p < 0.001), a progressive decline in eGFR (-10.04 ± 19.38 vs 1.70 ± 18.51 ml/min/1.73 m(2)/year; p = 0.045), and more frequently achieved the primary outcome (50.0 vs 10.8%, p = 0.013), and ESRD (30.0 vs 2.7%, p = 0.026). No difference was observed in Oxford classification variables. Baseline proteinuria, endocapillary hypercellularity and mesangial C4d deposition were associated with primary outcome in univariate analysis. Proteinuria and mesangial C4d deposition at baseline independently predicted the decline in eGFR. Renal survival was significantly reduced in C4d-positive patients (8.6 vs 15.1 years in C4d-negative patients, p < 0.001).
2:::Ten patients presenting lytic lesions of the proximal femur were to be treated. The device consisted of two components implanted in the proximal femur, combined with bone cement. Patients were followed at 2, 6 and 12 months to record technical feasibility, safety and efficacy parameters of the procedure.
4:::Statin use was associated with an increased likelihood of developing T2DM in children without dyslipidemia. Physicians and patients need to weigh the possible risk of T2DM against the long-term benefits of statin therapy at a young age.
3:::The lumbar spine CAD algorithm detected the epidural space with a sensitivity of 94.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.1%-98.1%) and a specificity of 85.5% (95% CI, 81.7%-88.6%) and measured its depth with an error of approximately ±0.5 cm compared with measurements obtained manually from the 2-dimensional ultrasound images. The spine midline was detected with a sensitivity of 93.9% (95% CI, 85.8%-97.7%) and specificity of 91.3% (95% CI, 83.6%-96.9%), and its lateral position within the ultrasound image was measured with an error of approximately ±0.3 cm. The bone enhancement imaging mode produced images with 5.1- to 10-fold enhanced bone contrast when compared with a comparable handheld ultrasound imaging system.
4:::Our findings do not support the notion that perinatal maternal depression is particularly detrimental to childrens psychological development, as the most robust effects were found for maternal depression occurring during preschool years.'
2:::Participants (N = 2231; 18-64 years at injury) were those in the Prospective Outcomes of Injury Study who completed the initial three-month and final two-year interviews. The outcome measure was whether participants reported ongoing injury-related problems at 2 years. Possible early post-injury predictors were identified from the first interview; pre-injury and injury-related potential confounders from the first interview, insurer records and hospital discharge records. Multivariable models estimated relative risks.
3:::A total of 84 subjects were recruited for this study (n = 28 in each group of RCVS, episodic migraine, and healthy control; mean age, 49.8 years). The RCVS group showed lower BHIs in all basal arteries, in comparison to healthy controls (p < 0.001, 0.009 for bilateral MCAs, p < 0.001 and 0.028 for bilateral PCAs, and p = 0.060 for the BA). Compared to migraineurs, RCVS patients had lower BHIs only in the anterior circulation (p = 0.002 and 0.038 for bilateral MCAs; p = 0.069 and 0.247 for bilateral PCAs; p = 0.120 for the BA). Of the 10 patients who had follow-up BHIs at 3 months, 7 showed complete normalization, while three did not.
3:::Compared with air, oxygen did not adversely affect biomarker concentrations at rest and significantly improved endurance time (mean difference = 99 ± 81s, P = 0.002), dyspnoea (-1 ± 1 U, P = 0.02), systolic blood pressure (BP; -11 ± 11 mm Hg, P = 0.006), nadir oxyhaemoglobin saturation (SpO2 ; 8 ± 6%, P = 0.001), SpO2 at 2-min (7 ± 6%, P = 0.003) and 5-min isotimes (5 ± 3, P < 0.001) and peak exercise xanthine concentrations (-42 ± 73 µmol/L, P = 0.03). Air significantly increased IL-10 (5 ± 5 pg/mL, P = 0.04) at 2-min isotime. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs), IL-6, TNF-α, creatine kinase, lactate, heart rate and fatigue did not differ between the two interventions at any time point.
2:::The sample consisted of 284 volunteers, aged >65 years (52% women, 48% men) accepting clinical and instrumental follow-up at 7 years. OSA was defined as an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) of ≥15.
4:::Acute-phase sepsis is associated with increased hGR expression and cortisol concentrations, possibly implying no need for exogenous steroids. At this stage, hGR is able to predict sepsis and outcome and is related to stress-activated bio-molecules and organ dysfunction.
3:::Currently, there are no qualified emergency medical physicians in Sri Lanka. However, a specialist training program for emergency physicians was initiated in 2012. There is no formal system to train emergency medical technicians (EMTs). Sri Lankans usually use taxies or their private vehicles to get to the hospital in the case of an emergency. All of the hospitals have ambulances that they can use to transport patients between hospitals. Most hospitals have emergency treatment units. Those at larger hospitals tend to be better than those at smaller hospitals. Although there is a disaster management system, it is not focused on emergency medical needs.
2:::From January 2010 to December 2015, 151 large and giant vestibular schwannomas were operated in our department. Tumor diameter was between 30 and 60 mm. The most common presenting symptom was hearing loss, which was observed in 41.66% of all our patients. All patients were operated in the semi-sitting position with opening of the posterior wall of the internal auditory canal and under continuous intraoperative facial nerve function monitoring.
1:::To report acute and late toxicity rates in patients with high-risk prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and moderate hypofractionated radiation therapy (HypoRT) to the prostate and nodal areas.
3:::Climate, Preventure and CAP students demonstrated significantly lower growth in their likelihood to drink and binge drink, relative to controls over 24 months. Preventure students displayed significantly lower growth in their likelihood to experience alcohol harms, relative to controls. While adolescents in both the CAP and Climate groups demonstrated slower growth in drinking compared with adolescents in the control group over the 2-year study period, CAP adolescents demonstrated faster growth in drinking compared with Climate adolescents.
4:::Findings support universal, selective and combined approaches to alcohol prevention. Particularly novel are the findings of no advantage of the combined approach over universal or selective prevention alone.
2:::This observational study comprised 5-19-year-olds with physician-diagnosed ADHD (n = 476) and non-ADHD controls (n = 202). ROC analysis evaluated the ability of WFIRS-P to discriminate between ADHD and non-ADHD, and identified a WFIRS-P cut-off score that optimises correct classification. Data were analysed for the complete sample, for males versus females and for participants in two age groups (5-12 versus 13-19 years).
3:::Area under the curve (AUC) was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.88-0.93) for the overall WFIRS-P score, suggesting highly accurate classification of ADHD distinct from non-ADHD. Sensitivity (0.83) and specificity (0.85) were maximal for a mean overall WFIRS-P score of 0.65, suggesting that this is an appropriate threshold for differentiation. DeLongs test found no significant differences in AUCs for males versus females or 5-12 versus 13-19 years, suggesting that WFIRS-P is an accurate classifier of ADHD across gender and age.'
4:::The leaves of A. odoratissima showed potent free radical scavenging property and antimicrobial activity.
3:::The database search yielded 10771 unique articles. Screening resulted in 428 included RCTs. Three studies explicitly included patients with a comorbid condition. Fifteen percent of articles did not specify additional conditions that were excluded. Impaired cognition was the most commonly excluded condition. Approximately 37% of articles excluded patients who had experienced a previous stroke. Twenty-four percent excluded patients one or more Charlson Index condition, and 83% excluded patients with at least one other medical condition.
2:::Patients undergoing OAR or EVAR were identified in the 2005 to 2012 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database and stratified into three groups: normal albumin (serum albumin >3.5 g/dL), moderate hypoalbuminemia (2.8-3.5 g/dL), and severe hypoalbuminemia (<2.8 g/dL). Multivariable analyses were performed to assess the association of preoperative hypoalbuminemia with 30-day morbidity and mortality.
3:::A total of 200 webpages returned (108 unique website addresses). The average DISCERN score was <50 points for all modalities and search engines. No significant difference was seen in readability between modalities or between search engines. Websites carrying validated accreditation marks were associated with higher average DISCERN scores: X-ray (39.36 vs 25.35), computed tomography (45.45 vs 31.33), and ultrasound (40.91 vs 27.62) (P < .01). Academic/government institutions produced material with higher DISCERN scores: X-ray (40.06 vs 22.23), magnetic resonance imaging (44.69 vs 29), ultrasound (46 vs 31.91), and positron emission tomography (45.93 vs 38.31) (P < .01). Commercial websites produced material with lower mean DISCERN scores: X-ray (17.25 vs 31.69), magnetic resonance imaging (20.8 vs 40.1), ultrasound (24.11 vs 42.35), and positron emission tomography (24.5 vs 44.45) (P < .01).
4:::Although readability is adequate, the overall quality of radiology-related health-care information on the Internet is poor. High-quality online resources should be identified so that patients may avoid the use of poor-quality information derived from general search engine queries.
3:::Ever EVP/cannabis use was lower among middle school students (3.4%) than high school students (11.5%). Blunt use was reported by 6.0% of middle school and 24.1% of high school students. Approximately one-third of youth who had ever administered cannabis via either mode reported using both EVP/cannabis and blunts. EVP/cannabis and blunt use were both associated with lower school performance and use of other tobacco products. EVP/cannabis use did not vary by race/ethnicity, but blunt use was higher among black and Hispanic youth than white, non-Hispanic youth.
2:::One hundred fifty blood samples collected from 76 patients were measured using the two systems. We first developed the prototype of the Human IL-6 RAYFAST. Then, we examined the correlation between the prototype RAYFAST and chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) methods. Finally, we compared IL-6 concentrations and clinical parameters using both systems.
3:::A total of 43,694 patients aged ≥18years receiving de novo CABG were included in the study cohort. The incidence and risk of ischemic stroke and death were positively associated with CHA2DS2-VASc score in patients receiving CABG. In addition, the discriminatory properties of the score resulted in C-statistics of 0.60 (95% CI=0.59-0.61) and 0.63 (95% CI=0.62-0.64) for the prediction of ischemic stroke and death in patients undergoing CABG, respectively.
4:::The present study is the first nationwide cohort study to investigate the performance of CHA2DS2-VASc score for the prediction of ischemic stroke and death in patients receiving CABG. However, the discriminative power was modest, and the predictive role of CHA2DS2-VASc score in this population remained to be determined.
2:::We evaluated an optical see-through goggle augmented imaging and navigation system (GAINS) for near-infrared, fluorescence-guided surgery. Tumor-bearing mice injected with a near infrared cancer-targeting agent underwent fluorescence-guided, tumor resection. Female Yorkshire pigs received hind leg intradermal indocyanine green injection and underwent fluorescence-guided, popliteal lymph node resection. Four breast cancer patients received (99m)Tc-sulfur colloid and indocyanine green retroareolarly before undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy using radioactive tracking and fluorescence imaging. Three other breast cancer patients received indocyanine green retroareolarly before undergoing standard-of-care partial mastectomy, followed by fluorescence imaging of resected tumor and tumor cavity for margin assessment.
1:::To investigate whether influence at work modifies the association between demanding and strenuous occupational physical activity (OPA) and risk of ischaemic heart disease (IHD).
3:::The final cohort after propensity score matching comprised 264 patients. Baseline ascites severity and UK end-stage liver disease (UKELD) score between carvedilol (n=132) and non-carvedilol (n=132) treated patient groups were comparable. Median follow-up time was 2.3years. Survival at the end of the follow-up was 24% and 2% for the carvedilol and the non-carvedilol groups respectively (log-rank p<0.0001). The long-term survival was significantly better in carvedilol than non-carvedilol group (log-rank p<0.001). The survival difference remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, ascites severity, aetiology of cirrhosis, previous variceal bleed, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis prophylaxis, serum albumin and UKELD with hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44, 0.80; p=0.001), suggesting a 41% reduction in mortality risk. When stratified by the severity of ascites, carvedilol therapy resulted in hazard ratio of 0.47 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.77; p=0.003) in those with mild ascites. Even with moderate or severe ascites, carvedilol use was not associated with increased mortality risk.
2:::We created an HTML browser-based ultrasound simulation application, which reads the input of different sensors, triggering an ultrasound video to be displayed on a respective device. RFID tags, NFC tags, and QR Codes™ have been integrated into training phantoms or were attached to standardized patients. The RFID antenna was hidden in a mock ultrasound probe. The application is independent from the respective device.
3:::The median number of retrieved lymph nodes was 20 (mean 21 ± 10, range 1-65) in right-sided, 13 (16 ± 10, 1-66) in left-sided, and 15 (18 ± 11, 3-64) in rectal tumors. The number of retrieved lymph nodes was independently associated with T-classification (p < 0.001), N-classification (p = 0.014), and tumor size (p = 0.005) as well as right-sided tumor location (p = 0.012). There was no association with age, sex, tumor grade, mismatch-repair status, and lymph or blood vessel invasion. The longer the surgical specimen, the higher were the numbers of retrieved and positive lymph nodes (p < 0.001, respectively). In patients with locally advanced (T3/T4) tumors (n = 283), analysis of more than 12 lymph nodes was independently associated with PFS (HR = 0.63, p = 0.025) and CSS (HR = 0.54, p = 0.004). In the subset of T3/T4 N0 patients (n = 130), analysis of more than 12 lymph nodes similarly proved to be an independent predictor of outcome (PFS, HR = 0.48, p = 0.046; OS, HR = 0.41, p = 0.026).
4:::Increased expressions of TLR-3, TLR-4 and CD80 mRNA and the level of urinary CD80/creatinine could be useful markers to differentiate patients of SSNS in relapse from those with SRNS. Further these markers can also distinguish biopsy proven MCD from FSGS in SRNS patients.
2:::A total of 2306 patients on maintained HD for stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) were included in this prospective study. Their average ultrafiltration/dry weight ratio and BP before dialysis were recorded. The serum NT-proBNP, hemoglobin, serum calcium, and phosphorus were detected. The cutoff value for NT-proBNP level was calculated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.
3:::No significant differences were identified between the two groups with respect to demographic and clinical characteristics. Fewer needle passes were required to obtain core specimens in the FNB group (p<0.001). There were no differences in the proportion of histologic core (11.8%±19.5% vs 8.0%±11.1%, p=0.376) or in the diagnostic accuracy (80.6% vs 81.5%, p=0.935) between two groups.
4:::Adolescents with weak working memory have less control over impulsive urges, placing them at risk for later substance use disorder with some of the effects mediated by early drug use progression.
3:::Two percent rebamipide liquid, administered six times a day for 14 days from day -7 to day 6, significantly decreased the ulcer-like area. However, no significant effect was observed when rebamipide was given either from day -4 or from day -1. Four or six times daily, 2% rebamipide liquid significantly inhibited the ulcer-like injury area ratio, but not when given twice daily. Rebamipide liquid, 1, 2, and 4% six times daily significantly reduced the area ratios of total injury and ulcer-like injury in a dose-dependent manner. Gene expression and protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were dramatically elevated in the irradiated tongues of control rats on day 7 without rebamipide liquid treatment. They were dose-dependently and significantly suppressed in rebamipide-treated groups.
2:::265 consecutive patients [62% males, median age 80 (interquartile range (IQR): 72-86) years, median NTproBNP 3633 (IQR: 2025-6407) ng/l] admitted with HF between 2013 and 2014 were enrolled. Patients were screened for frailty using the Derby frailty index (DFI), acute frailty network (AFN) frailty criteria, and clinical frailty scale (CFS) and for malnutrition using the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score and prognostic nutritional index (PNI).
3:::The World Conferences on Smoking and Health and World Health Organization in the late 1970s spurred the Nigerian government to take steps towards tobacco regulation. In response, the tobacco industry lobbied government ministries, used front groups and its trade group, the Tobacco Advisory Council of Nigeria, to block and weaken government efforts. The industry obtained a draft of Decree 20 two years before it was enacted, considered the Decree anti-business and proposed language that led to the passage of a weaker Decree in 1990. It also attempted to influence a potential review of the Decree in 1995.
4:::Immunofluorescence is a highly specific diagnostic test for PCD, and it improves the speed and availability of diagnostic testing. However, sensitivity is limited and immunofluorescence is not suitable as a stand-alone test.
2:::A cross-sectional design was used to analyze the results of three randomized clinical trials in healthy pregnant women from Madrid (Spain) and Buenos Aires (Argentina). Five hundred and sixty-eight pregnant women were recruited. For each of the studies, the number of women in the exercise group totaled 107 for study 1 (land), 49 women for study 2 (water), and 101 women for study 3 (land + water). A total of 311 women represented the control group (CG) (pooled together from all three studies).
3:::The pooled wash-through fractions contained 3% of loaded mAbShavIV reactive saponin glycosides, while eluted fractions released ~ 90% of shatavarin saponin glycosides in a single step. Using thiobarbiturate (TBARs) to measure lipid-peroxidation, the extract, and the pooled wash-through fractions showed moderate protection against Cu(+) -induced oxidation of human low density lipoprotein (LDL) (IC50 11.3 ± 1.4 and 12.6 ± 0.9 μg/mL, respectively). In contrast, the saponin glycosides eluted from the mAbShavIV-column had weaker protectant (IC50 29.7 ± 1.8 μg/mL) suggesting that A. racemosus shatavarins do not inhibit carcinogenesis through preventing lipid peroxidation.
1:::Cetuximab inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and papulopustular eruptions is a frequent side effect. Vitamin K3 (menadione) has preclinically shown to be a potential activator of the EGFR by phosphorylating the receptor (pEGFR). The present randomised study investigated the effect of a vitamin K3 cream on cetuximab-induced rash.
4:::Differences were found by physician type in care of children with ADHD. Additional studies are needed to understand clinical consequences of these differences and the implications for care coordination across provider specialties.
2:::The prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and the activities of other factors were determined by the one-stage clotting method. The prothrombin antigen was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Function of the mutant protein was evaluated by thrombin generation tests. Potential mutations in exons, exon-intron boundaries and 5, 3' untranslated sequences of prothrombin gene were screened by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. Suspected mutations were confirmed by reverse sequencing. The structure change of this protein was analyzed by model and bioinformatics analyses.'
3:::Of 695 eligible patients (376 men [54.1%]; 319 women [45.9%]; mean [SD] age, 60.1 [14.0] years), 189 survived 8 years or longer, including 95 in the 400-mg/d dose arm and 94 in the 800-mg/d arm. The 10-year estimate of overall survival was 23% (95% CI, 20%-26%). Among 142 long-term survivors, imatinib was the sole therapy administered in 69 (48.6%), with additional systemic agents administered to 54 patients (38.0%). Resequencing studies of 20 cases originally classified as KIT/PDGFRA wild-type GIST revealed that 17 (85.0%) harbored a pathogenic mutation, most commonly a mutation of a subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase complex.
3:::The median (interquartile range) baseline adiponectin concentration was 5.2 (3.5-7.9) μg/mL. Patients with the highest baseline adiponectin concentration (quartile [Q]4) were at significantly higher risk of death from a CV event (8.4% vs 1.7%; P < .0001), hospitalization for heart failure (HF; 7.5% vs 1.7%; P < .0001), and all-cause mortality (10.8% vs 2.4%; P < .0001) compared with those in Q1. After adjusting for age, sex, index event, HF, estimated glomerular filtration rate and hypertension, adiponectin concentration in Q4 remained associated with an increased risk of death from CV causes (hazard ratio [HR] 2.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.52, 3.88), all-cause mortality (HR 2.45, 95% CI 1.65, 3.64), and HF (HR 2.44, 95% CI 1.47, 4.05), without change after stratification by body mass index. There was no significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction or stroke.
4:::Long-term survivors of glioblastoma continue to have significant symptom burden and care needs. There is currently a paucity of literature surrounding this topic. Further research is required to accurately describe these issues in order for improved supportive care to be implemented in the community and the outpatient setting.
2:::Our prospective cohort study used surveillance, epidemiology, and end results linked to the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey. We included 6290 individuals 65 years or older diagnosed with incident lung cancer from 1998 to 2013. We assessed the prognostic value of (1) short-form 36 summary component and domain-specific scores, (2) activities of daily living (ADL), and (3) two global HRQOL questions. Cox-proportional hazards models were used to examine associations between HRQOL and OS, adjusting for demographics, comorbid conditions, and clinical characteristics.
3:::A significant local K(trans) increase (0.03 min(-1) vs 0.07 min(-1), p = 0.033) compatible with BBB disruption was evident in 5 patients (71%) on POD 1. Resolution was observed by POD 5 (mean, 0.012 min(-1)). The location of the disruption was most prominent in the frontal lobes (400% vs 150% K(trans) levels upsurge, p = 0.05). MRI evidence of microembolization was demonstrated in only 1 patient (14%). The postoperative global cognitive score was reduced in all patients (98.2 ± 12 vs 95.1 ± 11, p = 0.032), predominantly in executive and attention (frontal lobe-related) functions (91.8 ± 13 vs 86.9 ± 12, p = 0.042). The intensity of the dynamic contrast enhancement MRI BBB impairment correlated with the magnitude of cognition reduction (r = 0.69, p = 0.04).
2:::Classification and Regression Tree models were used to identify cut points based on individual-level grip strength associated with slow gait speed (<0.8 m/second) among 7,688 individuals (57% female; 8% black; mean age, 74.6 [SD=6.79] years) from the 2010/2012 Health and Retirement Study during January-April 2016. Identified cut points were then used to quantify the prevalence of weakness by race/sex subgroup.
3:::Fifty-five percent of men (maximum grip strength <39 kg) and 47% of women (maximum grip strength <22 kg) were classified as weak. Higher cut points were identified for black men (maximum grip strength <40 kg) and women (maximum grip strength <31 kg), and the prevalence of weakness (57% and 88%, respectively) was higher compared with whites. Fifty-five percent of individuals had slow gait speed (<0.8 m/second).
4:::High annual cessation rates may reflect the older age and greater comorbidities of the cohort or the intensive cessation efforts of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The lower cessation and higher relapse rates in psychiatric and substance use disorders suggest that these groups will need intensive and sustained cessation efforts.
3:::Among 19,590 cases and 19,590 controls, we observed an increased risk of HOA in patients with hyperlipidaemia (OR 1.37, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.28-1.47), when compared to patients without hyperlipidaemia. Thus, of all HOA cases in our study population, 3.6% may have been attributable to the presence of hyperlipidaemia (population attributable risk). Most patients with HOA were elderly, but the strength of the association between HOA and hyperlipidaemia inversely correlated with increasing age, with the highest OR of 1.72 (95% CI 1.24-2.38) in patients aged 29-49 years. Categorization by previous hyperlipidaemia duration, as well as sub-classification of patients with hyperlipidaemia into those with and without recent statin use did not meaningfully change the effect estimate.
2:::A sample of British leisure centre users (N=356; age range 18-69 y: mean age 26.5±10.4 y) completed the BLPAQ and two reference measures: the Baecke Questionnaire of Habitual Physical Activity (BQHPA) and the Godins Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ). MANOVA was used to test for gender differences in LPA. Each measure was also cross-validated using a split-sample approach and the limits of agreement (LoA) method.'
4:::Long-term regional chemotherapy was associated with improved survival in patients with MPM. In this rare disease, additional phase 2 investigations are suggested.
3:::There were a total of 5332 adult patients admitted over the study period. 6% (n=428) had a preexisting cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease patients had a higher mortality rate (16%) compared to those without cardiovascular disease (3%, p<0.001). The adjusted Poisson regression model to estimate incidence risk of being in intensive care unit in patients with cardiovascular disease was 33% higher compared to those without cardiovascular disease (IRR=1.33, 95% CI=1.22-1.47). The risk for mortality is 42% higher (IRR=1.42, 95% CI=1.10-1.84) for patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease compared to those without cardiovascular disease after controlling for other covariates.
1:::Educational interventions incorporating patient-specific prescriber feedback have improved osteoporosis screening and treatment among at-risk patients in clinical trials but have not been evaluated nationally. This study assessed uptake of BMD testing and osteoporosis medicines following two national Australian quality improvement initiatives targeting women (70-79 years) and men (75-85 years) at risk of osteoporosis.
2:::Administrative health claims data were used to determine monthly rates of BMD testing and initiation of osteoporosis medicines in the 9-months post-intervention among targeted men and women compared to older cohorts of men and women. Log binomial regression models were used to assess differences between groups.
3:::Thirty-three responses were received (22%); 60% from interventional radiologists and 20% from pulmonologists; 67% from the USA, 21% European, and 6% Asian. In HHT patients with initial negative screening echocardiogram, 60% recommended repeat screening contrast echocardiogram in 5 years, while 15% felt that no additional screening was necessary in these patients. Fifty-nine percentage reported never having seen a patient with initial negative contrast echocardiogram become positive. In patients with grade 1 echocardiograms, 41% recommended contrast-enhanced CT as the next step in management, 22% recommended non-contrast CT, and 22 and 3% recommended repeat echocardiogram in 5 and 10 years, respectively. In patients with grade 1 echocardiograms but no visible PAVMs, opinions regarding the use of bubble filters were evenly divided, while 79% recommended prophylactic antibiotics prior to invasive procedures. Eighty percentages of respondents treat PAVMs with feeding artery less than 3 mm, and 52% treat feeders less than 2 mm. Regarding follow-up, 71% reported seeing PAVM recurrence at the site of a previously completely treated PAVM.
4:::There is a measurable time dependence of ADC in prostate cancer, which is dependent on the underlying tissue and Gleason score. Therefore, there may be an optimal selection of t for prediction of tumor grade using ADC. Controlling t should allow ADC to achieve greater reproducibility between different sites and vendors. Intentionally varying t enables targeted exploration of D(t), a previously overlooked biophysical phenomenon in the prostate. Its further microstructural understanding and modeling may lead to novel diffusion-derived biomarkers.
3:::On the 5-item FAMCARE, sites ranged from mean scores of 5.5-6.9 out of a possible high score of 10. Family members at one care site (n = 783) were significantly (p < 0.05) less satisfied with their care than family members at four other care sites. The original 20-item measure failed to differentiate satisfaction levels between all hospital sites.
2:::A prospective observational study of 56 infants of women who used snus (n = 23) or cigarettes (n = 13) during pregnancy versus tobacco- and nicotine-free controls (n = 19). The nicotine dose was estimated by questionnaires at 4 timepoints pre- and post-natally. The infants urine cotinine concentration and HRV during 2 hours of sleep were studied 1-2 months after birth.'
3:::After the 75% body mass sled push, sprint time was 0.26±1.03% slower at the 15s time point (effect size [ES]=0.07) but faster at the 4 (-0.95±2.00%; ES=-0.22), 8 (-1.80±1.43%; ES=-0.42) and 12 (-1.54±1.54%; ES=-0.36)min time points. Sprint time was slower at all the time points after the 125% body mass sled (1.36±2.36%-2.59±2.90%; ESs=0.34-0.64).
4:::Twenty-meter sprint performance is potentiated 4-12min following a sled push loaded with 75% body mass while it is impaired after a 125% body mass sled. These results are of great importance for coaches seeking to potentiate sprint performance with the sled push exercise.
2:::Clinical data of all consecutive patients treated with percutaneous atherectomy utilizing the SilverHawk™ plaque excision was retrospectively analyzed. The anatomic criteria of the atherosclerotic lesions were divided into four types: type I stenosis; type II occlusion; type III in-stent restenosis; type IV stent occlusion.
3:::Whether or not global signal regression, compared with healthy controls, schizophrenia patients consistently exhibited decreased rsFC between the left OFCi and the left middle temporal gyrus and the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), between the right OFCi and the right MFG and the left inferior frontal gyrus, between the right OFCm and the middle cingulate cortex and the left Rolandic operculum. These rsFC changes still remained significant even after cortical atrophy correction.
3:::DBT was more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing weight loss (p < .001). Reduction of comorbidities was higher in patients treated with DBT, as for diabetes (p = .68), hypertension (p = .02), and OSAS (p = .03). LRYGB outcomes seem to be significantly better than those of LAGB, mainly in TAU group.
2:::Logistic regression modeling was utilized in a retrospective chart-review analysis of heart-failure patients (60% Male, 90% of European descent) to assess whether CYP2D6*4 (non-functional CYP2D6 allele present in 1 of 5 individuals of European descent) is associated with maintenance dose of carvedilol (n = 65) or metoprolol (n = 33).
4:::This study is an initial step towards understanding mechanistic features of the NET intervention. Specifically, brain regions involved with traumatic memories and distress such as the brainstem, insula, anterior cingulate gyrus, and parahippocampus had significantly reduced activity after the NET intervention and were associated with clinical improvement of symptoms associated with distressing recollections.
1:::To evaluate the feasibility of short-segment coil embolization between 2 balloons for tight packing in an experimental vascular model.
3:::TRD patients did not improve on a test of immediate verbal recognition from baseline to T1, whereas HCs did (group x time: p = 0.001). Both TRD patients and HCs improved over sessions on tests measuring delayed verbal recall, visuospatial memory, planning and object naming (all p < 0.01). Active and sham stimulation did not have an impact on any of the tests differentially.
2:::Patients with functional constipation (Rome III criteria) were randomized to VIBRANT or sham capsule treatment for 8 weeks and underwent scintigraphic colonic transit measurements during week 8. We estimated the overall rate of colonic transit from the slope of progression of colonic geometric center over 48 hours. The capsule was activated 8 hours after ingestion, and the vibration sequence included 240 cycles.
4:::Pharmacists will play a key role in managing the introduction of biosimilars into health care systems. Understanding the principles of biosimilar development and evolving regulatory guidelines relevant to their use will allow pharmacists to make informed decisions regarding formulary inclusion and educate patients and other health care providers about biosimilars.
3:::The 4-s temporal resolution CS images minimized streaking artifacts and noise while the 1-s temporal resolution AIF minimized errors in GFR estimates. A paired t-test showed that there was no statistically significant difference between MRI based total GFR values and serum creatinine based eGFR estimates (P = 0.92).
2:::This was an institutional review board-approved cohort study of patients receiving FH testing from 2008 to 2013. SP was defined as a report of HLRCC histologic features identified during a prospective pathologic assessment. The association between SP and FH mutations was analyzed.
3:::Sixty participants completed the study (≤60-day, n = 40; >60-day, n = 20). In the ≤60-day group, 92% of participants achieved the 0.5 MET improvement upon CR completion; whereas 60% of the >60-day group met this criteria (P ≤ .05). For the 150 min/wk of moderate-vigorous physical activity and CR adherence, both groups were not significantly different at any time. Elevated depressive symptoms were initially observed in 45% of participants in the ≤60-day group and 35% in the >60-day group (NS) and decreased to 8% in the ≤60-day group compared with 30% in the >60-day group at 12 months (P ≤ .05).
4:::Risk factors for community-associated MDRPA include prior history of MDRPA and exposure to carbapenems. Awareness of these factors is important for targeted prevention and treatment of MDRPA in patients with SCI/D.
2:::Rugby players from three universities (N=104; 90M:14F; 20.6±1.9years) were recruited before the beginning of the season. Players underwent pre-season assessments of power, strength, speed, agility, endurance, stability, and flexibility. Throughout the season, rugby-related injury and exposure data were collected. Potential predictor variables were analyzed using Cox proportional regression model to identify risk factors associated with severe injuries (time loss>28days).
3:::Twenty trials met inclusion criteria. In total, 4255 pre-schoolers were analysed with 854 completing a FMS intervention. Studies were categorised into three groups (i) Teacher-Led (TL)(n=13); (ii) Child-Centred (CC)(n=6) and (iii) Parent-Led (PL)(n=1). Mean age was 4.3±0.4 years, with equal gender distribution. Interventions ran for 21±17 weeks, 3±1 times per week for 35±17 minutes. TL interventions significantly improved overall FMS (SMD=0.14[0.06, 0.21]; p=0.0003), object control (SMD=0.47[0.15, 0.80]; p= 0.004), and locomotor skills (SMD=0.44[0.16, 0.73]; p=0.002), whereas CC interventions were not significant. There was a small, non-significant reduction in sedentary time (SMD=-0.35[-0.80, 0.10]; p= 0.12), and a large non-significant increase in PA (SMD=0.79[-0.83, 2.41]; p=0.34).
3:::In the Lipinski filter and ADME/Tox screening, all test compounds produced positive results, but in the target fishing, only one flavonoid could successfully target AChE. Molecular docking was performed on this flavonoid, and this compound gained the score as -13.5762. From the QSAR analysis the IC50 was found to be 1659.59 nM. Again, 100 derivatives were generated from the parent compound and docking was performed. The derivative compound 20 was the best scorer, i.e. -31.6392 and IC50 was predicted as 6.025 nM.
2:::The CR program used a cognitive training software combined with group sessions to educate cognitive skills. 102 BP were screened by a neuropsychological test battery. Of those, 39 BP showed distinct cognitive impairments and 26 patients of them participated in the CR program for 12 weeks and then were retested. A matched control group consisting of 10 BP was measured at baseline and follow-up after three months (treatment as usual).
4:::Intrinsic motivators (e.g., calling) were associated with each measure of physician well-being (satisfaction, meaning, and commitment), but extrinsic motivators (e.g., annual income) were not associated with meaning or commitment. Understanding the effects of intrinsic motivators may help inform efforts to support physician well-being.
3:::Baseline data from 516 patients were available (347 males; mean (SD) age: 71.3 ± 8.6 years). Univariate analysis showed significant associations between HRQoL and demographic, clinical and physiological features. However, multivariate analysis demonstrated independent associations only between SGRQ and dyspnoea (University of California San Diego Shortness of Breathlessness Questionnaire (UCSD-SOBQ); R(2) = 0.71, P < 0.0001), cough severity (visual analogue scale; R(2) = 0.06, P < 0.0001) and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; R(2) = 0.04, P < 0.0001). Linear mixed-effects modelling of combined baseline and longitudinal data confirmed these associations, as well as for FVC% predicted (P = 0.005). Multivariate Cox proportionate-proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated no association between HRQoL and risk of mortality.
2:::Implant-mediated drug delivery systems (IMDDS) were installed in a total of 18 rabbits. After complete healing, water-soluble metformin hydrochloride was administered to one group (n = 9) while poorly soluble dexamethasone was administered to the other group (n = 9). The release patterns of each group were monitored for two weeks by measuring the plasma concentration of each drug.
3:::In 6044 people without diabetes (84.7%), severe hyperglycaemia, defined as a glucose level of > 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl), was associated with a doubling in the risk of 30-day mortality [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.9; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.1 to 3.3; P = 0.018] and a three-fold increase in the risk of intensive care unit admission (adjusted OR 3.0; 95% CI, 1.9 to 4.9; P < 0.001). These associations were similar among different diagnoses. In the population with diabetes (n = 1088), no association with 30-day mortality was found (adjusted OR 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.8; P for interaction = 0.001), whereas the association with intensive care unit admission was weaker (adjusted OR 2.4; 95% CI, 1.5 to 4.1; P for interaction = 0.011). Overall 30-day mortality was higher in those with diabetes than in those without (6.1 vs. 4.4%, P = 0.015).
4:::In this large medical emergency department patient cohort, admission hyperglycaemia was strongly associated with adverse clinical course in people without diabetes. (Clinical Trial Registry No: NCT01768494).
1:::The AUA (American Urological Association) QIPS (Quality Improvement and Patient Safety) committee created a white paper on the diagnosis and management of nonneurogenic chronic urinary retention.
3:::Overall, 4 of 15 (27%) component exchanges, 2 of 45 (4%) CRRs, and 4 of 19 (21%) 2-stage procedures required a reoperation for infection with a minimum of 1 year of follow-up. The difference between the CRR group and exchange group was significant (P = .030); however, the difference between the CRR group and 2-stage group did not reach statistical significance (P = .059). No preoperative and intraoperative selection bias between the groups was found. Binary logistic regression predicted that reinfection was highest in patients whose cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus (P = .004) or coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (P = .041) or those treated with a component exchange (P = .015). The difference between groups for noninfection-related complications was not significant (P = .703). All procedures provided improved functional outcomes and pain relief.
2:::The hypotheses were tested in a two-wave prospective sample comprising 2337 employees from Norwegian governmental ministries who were exposed to the 2011 Oslo terror attack. The two waves of data collection were conducted 10 and 22 months after the terror attack.
4:::The results indicate that victimization from bullying is associated with elevated levels of PTSS in the aftermath of a workplace terror attack, but that bullying does not have any impact on the long-term development of PTSS. PTSS may be a potential antecedent of bullying. These findings suggest that organizations must give high priority to the psychosocial work environment of traumatized employees to prevent further detrimental health consequences.
3:::Finally, 37 cases were studied: 5 samples of benign prostatic hyperplasia, 14 cases with localized neoplasms (7 high-risk according to the DAmico classification), 5 with metastasic tumors (bone metastases), and 13 treated with AD therapy, of which 6 fulfilled the requirements to be defined as resistant to castration. In tumors without AD therapy, MMP11 expression was significantly higher (P=.001) in fibroblasts of higher grade tumors. A significant (P=.001) correlation was found between PSA and expression of MMP11 in fibroblast s and a significant increase of MMP11 expression in metastatic tumors. In tumors with AD therapy, a significantly greater expression of MMP11 was observed in resistant to castration patients than in those sensitive to castration (P=.003).'
2:::Longitudinal analyses utilized electronic health record data from 2011 to 2014. We examined how the patient activation measure (PAM) was predictive of 2014 diabetes-related outcomes among patients with diabetes (n=10,071); pre-diabetes (n=1804); and neither diabetes nor pre-diabetes (n=46,402). Outcomes were clinical indicators (blood pressure, cholesterol, and trigylcerides), costly utilization, and progression from no diabetes to pre-diabetes or diabetes.
3:::We found that adolescents exposed to high levels of adversity early in their lives had lower levels of associative learning than comparison adolescents. In addition, we found that impaired associative learning partially explained the higher levels of behavioral problems among youth who suffered early adversity. Using mathematical models, we also found that two components of learning were specifically affected in children exposed to adversity: choice variability and biases in their beliefs about the likelihood of rewards in the environment.
4:::Participants who had been exposed to early adversity were less able than their peers to correctly learn which stimuli were likely to result in reward, even after repeated feedback. These individuals also used information about known rewards in their environments less often. In addition, individuals exposed to adversity made decisions early in the learning process as if rewards were less consistent and occurred more at random. These data suggest one mechanism through which early life experience shapes behavioral development.
3:::Among 2498 respiratory tract samples analyzed corresponding to 1503 patients, 1557 (62.3%) were performed early (≤5 days) and 941 (37.7%) later (>5 days). Positivity rates for ESBL-E were 15.0 and 36.8% for rectal swabs in the early and late groups, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values and likelihood ratios were calculated for ESBL-E digestive colonization as a predictor of ESBL-E presence in respiratory samples. PPVs of ESBL-E digestive colonization were 14.5% (95% CI [12.8; 16.3]) and 34.4% (95% CI [31.4; 37.4]), for the early and late groups, respectively, whereas NPVs were 99.2% (95% CI [98.7; 99.6]) and 93.4% (95% CI [91.9; 95.0]), respectively.
4:::Microtechnology can identify 97.6% of collision events during rugby league match-play. The typical error associated with measuring contact events can be reduced to 7.8%, with accuracy (92.7%) and specificity (91.7%) improving, when low-intensity (<1 PlayerLoad AU) and short duration (<1s) collision reports are excluded. This provides practitioners with a measurement of contact workload during professional rugby league matches.
1:::We compared paternity rates and time to conception between adolescents with varicocele undergoing microsurgical varicocele repair and patients who did not undergo surgery and were followed conservatively.
3:::High-quality mean DW images of the entire brain were obtained by acquiring 1 non-DW image and 6 DW images with different diffusion directions at b = 1000 s · mm. The achievable resolution for a total measuring time of 84 seconds was 1.5 mm in plane with a section thickness of 4 mm (55 sections). A measuring time of 168 seconds allowed for an in-plane resolution of 1.25 mm and a section thickness of 3 mm (54 sections). Apparent diffusion coefficient values were in agreement with literature data.
2:::PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane databases were systematically searched to identify all relevant studies. Odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to estimate the strength of association between BDNF gene rs6265 and rs2049046 polymorphism and migraine.
4:::Taste and smell abnormalities are prominent in gastroparesis and GERD patients. Abnormalities in taste and smell are significantly correlated with both gastroparesis and GERD symptom severity. Awareness of this high prevalence of taste and smell dysfunction among patients with gastroparesis and GERD may help to better understand the food intolerances these patients often have.
3:::Fifty-five patients each with NDPH (mean age 28.24 ± 12.05 years, 45.5% females) and age/sex matched healthy individuals and patients with chronic low-back pain were enrolled. Among NDPH patients, somatoform disorder was seen in 32.7%, severe anxiety in 65.5%, severe depressive symptoms in 40%, significant pain catastrophization in 85.5%. NDPH patients had significantly higher frequency of all psychiatric co-morbidities as compared to healthy controls and patients with chronic low-back pain. NDPH-CM patients had significantly higher frequency of depression and pain catastrophizing behaviour as compared to NDPH-CTTH.
2:::The implant was analysed in finite element simulations of level gait, adopted from the ISO 14243-1 standard. Mechanical integrity of the implant and underlying cement mantle were tested, and the fixation strength of the cement-implant interface was studied. Stress shielding was assessed based on strain energy density distributions in the distal femur. We compared PEEK and CoCr implants for mechanical performance and fixation, and compared both versions against an intact case to determine the change in bone strain energy density.
3:::We included 192 patients in this study. Younger age (B -0.08, 95%CI -0.11 to -0.05/year; p < 0.001), female gender (B 0.92, 95%CI 0.10-1.75; p = 0.029) and pre-existing pain (B 1.06, 95%CI 0.03-2.09; p = 0.044) were all associated with an increased risk for postoperative pain. In the multivariate analyses, only young age ((adjusted OR 0.95, 95%CI 0.92-0.97/year; p < 0.001) and pre-existing pain (adjusted OR 2.56, 95%CI 1.09-6.00; p = 0.031) remained as independent risk factors for severe postoperative pain.
4:::An 8-week dance-based exercise program significantly improved function and cardiorespiratory capacity, and decreased postexercise heart rate and fatigue. Most of these improvements were maintained at 3-month follow-up in obese postmenopausal women.
3:::  Overall reference scores method always produced more reproducible results (i.e., higher ICCs) than did VAS or the esthetic index. However, statistically significant differences were found between reference scores and esthetic index in rating nasal shape, nose deviation, and vermillion border only (P < 0.001, <0.001, and 0.012, respectively) and between reference scores and VAS in rating nose deviation and vermillion border (P < 0.001 and 0.017, respectively).
2:::A retrospective propensity-scores matched (1:4) cohort study was conducted by retrieving patient data for pulmonary TB after long-term dialysis commencement from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 1999 and 2013. Patients with TB (n = 1993) or without TB (n = 7972) were compared for 3-year morbidity and mortality. The effect of Directly Observed Treatment, Short-Course (DOTS) implementation was also evaluated. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine adjusted hazard ratios (HRs).
3:::Significant changes (P<0.05) were achieved between the two measurements and between groups for final Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-S) Score and for five of its seven subscales, including: days per week feeling good, pain intensity, fatigue, stiffness and depression/sadness, as well as all the ROM variables evaluated (neck flexion, neck extension, lateral neck flexion and rotation (bilateral), shoulder flexion and abduction and hip abduction) excluding hip flexion.
4:::Magnetic capture and lavage evaluate CTXII in different ways: Magnetic capture measures total CTXII in the joint, while lavage measures concentration. Our data indicate magnetic capture may be advantageous at later time points, where CTXII can be diluted by effusions.
2:::We developed a multivariate analytical pipeline to elucidate the cortical GM thickness systems that covary with major network hubs and assessed whether SVD and neurodegenerative pathologic markers were associated with attenuated covariance network integrity in mild AD and normal elderly control subjects.
3:::Compared with the nonattempter group, the attempter group showed significant reductions in gray matter volume in the orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum; white matter integrity in the uncinate fasciculus, ventral frontal, and right cerebellum regions; and amygdala functional connectivity to the left ventral and right rostral prefrontal cortex. In exploratory analyses, among attempters, there was a significant negative correlation between right rostral prefrontal connectivity and suicidal ideation and between left ventral prefrontal connectivity and attempt lethality.
4:::Although increased ambulatory PA had a positive relationship with better physical function, walking <2500 steps/d may be a simple indicator for a decrease in physical function in patients with knee OA among standard PA categories. Our findings might be a basis for counseling patients with knee OA about their ambulatory PA and for developing better strategies for improving physical function in sedentary patients with knee OA.
3:::Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was higher in PAH, intermediate in CpcPH, and low in IpcPH. All patients with CpcPH but 1 had PVR >3 Wood unit. Exercise-induced hyperventilation (high minute ventilation over carbon dioxide production, low end-tidal carbon dioxide) was marked in PAH, intermediate in CpcPH, and low in IpcPH (p < 0.001) and correlated with DPG and PVR. Prevalence of EOB decreased from IpcPH to CpcPH to PAH (p < 0.001).
2:::Twenty-two participants completed four testing sessions at 08:00 and 18:00h, 48h apart. Arm circumference, bSBP, and brachial diastolic blood pressure (bDBP) were measured at rest. Arterial occlusion pressure was determined using a cuff inflated on the proximal portion of the upper arm, with a Doppler probe placed over the radial artery.
4:::Some of the newly recognized clonal anomalies in BM reported here are recurrent, especially unbalanced structural anomalies of chromosome 7, a further complex rearrangement of the del(20)(q) with duplicated and deleted portions, and an unbalanced translocation t(3;6), with partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 3 and partial monosomy of the long arm of chromosome 6. Firm conclusions on the possible prognostic relevance of these anomalies would require further study with larger patient cohorts, but our data are sufficient to suggest that these patients necessitate more frequent cytogenetic monitoring. The results on anomalies found in single cells confirm the presence of an SDS-specific karyotype instability.
3:::Of a total of 506 patients with colorectal cancer, 398 underwent laparoscopic surgery and 23% of these patients were aged ≥80 years old. The elderly patients tended to have poorer general condition and larger tumors, although no significant differences were found in tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, or synchronous distant metastasis between the groups. After adjustment for preoperative factors, we noted that the elderly patients tended to undergo less aggressive surgical resection (P = 0.01). Further analysis after including surgical factors for propensity score matching revealed a similar rate of complications in the two groups (24 vs. 25%, respectively; P = 0.85), and similar postoperative death rates and length of postoperative hospital stay.
2:::Participants from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) Study self-reported participation at baseline, 30 months, and 60 months using the instrumental role subscale of the Late Life Disability Index (LLDI). Data on self-reported environmental features were from the Home and Community Environment questionnaire administered in the MOST Knee Pain and Disability study, an ancillary study of MOST. The relative risks (RRs) of developing participation restriction at 60 months, indicated by an LLDI score <67.6 out of a possible 100, due to reported high community mobility barriers and high transportation facilitators, were calculated using robust Poisson regression, adjusting for covariates.
1:::To evaluate the changes in the stimulus and response Accommodative Convergence to Accommodation (AC/A) ratio following vision therapy (VT) in Convergence Insufficiency (CI).
3:::The hospital staff were quite enthusiastic about two of the design innovations studied here (a new wayfinding strategy and the use of vibrant colors in specific areas of the facility). The third innovation, open-style communication centers, elicited more mixed evaluations. The results include extensive hypothesis testing about the effects of each innovation as well as narrative discussions of their pros and cons.
2:::Leaf samples from 43 Celastraceae species were extracted in water followed by basification of the aqueous extract and partitioning with methyl-t-butyl ether to provide an alkaloid-enriched fraction. The extract was derivatised in a two-stage process and analysed using GC-MS for the presence of cathine. Related alkaloids and other metabolites in this alkaloid-enriched fraction were tentatively identified.
3:::A total of 158 severe ARDS patients received ECMO were finally analyzed. Overall intensive care unit (ICU) mortality was 55.1%. After ECMO initiation, tidal volume, peak inspiratory pressure and dynamic driving pressure were decreased, while positive end-expiratory pressure levels were relative maintained. After ECMO initiation, nonsurvivors had significantly higher dynamic driving pressure until day 7 than survivors. Cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that immunocompromised [hazard ratio 1.957; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.216-3.147; p = 0.006], Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (hazard ratio 1.039; 95% CI 1.005-1.073; p = 0.023), ARDS duration before ECMO (hazard ratio 1.002; 95% CI 1.000-1.003; p = 0.029) and mean dynamic driving pressure from day 1 to 3 on ECMO (hazard ratio 1.070; 95% CI 1.026-1.116; p = 0.002) were independently associated with ICU mortality.
4:::This general population-based cohort study indicates that the level of premature mortality among patients with gout remains unimproved over the past 16 years, unlike RA during the same period. This unclosing premature mortality gap calls for improved management of gout and its comorbidities.
2:::Fifty-nine hyperlipidemic women were randomized into control (n = 30) and intervention groups (n = 29). Intervention group was administered 3.5 g of freeze-dried wheatgrass powder in encapsulated form daily for 10 weeks, while the control group received no intervention.
3:::Six Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients and six sleeve gastrectomy patients completed the study. Mean rivaroxaban area under plasma concentration-time curve, peak plasma concentration, time to peak plasma concentration and terminal half-life were 971.9 μg·h l(-1) (coefficient of variation: 10.6), 135.3 μg l(-1) (26.7), 1.5 h and 13.1 h (34.1) prior to and 1165.8 (21.9), 170.0 (15.9), 1.5 and 8.9 (44.6) postsurgery for SG patients and 933.7 μg·h l(-1) (22.3), 136.5 μg l(-1) (10.7), 1.5 h und 13.8 h (46.6) prior to and 1029.4 (7.4), 110.8 (31.8), 2.5 and 15 (60.0) postsurgery for Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients, respectively. Prothrombin fragments (F1 + 2) decreased during the first 12 hours and increased thereafter in the pre- and the postbariatric setting. Thrombin-antithrombin complexes dropped within 1-3 h in the prebariatric setting and remained low after surgery until they increased at 24 h postdose. Rivaroxaban was well tolerated and no relevant safety issues were observed.
4:::This survey indicated kidney injury wildly existed in non-renal outpatients, and the incidence of CKD is underestimated.
3:::No difference in PBF, TVR amplitude, HR latency, and Hmax/Mmax ratio were found between the control and CC/ACC conditions. On the other hand, BRT and PBD were significantly lengthened in the CC/ACC condition (240 ± 13 ms and 704 ± 70 ms, respectively) compared to control (183 ± 7 ms and 568 ± 36 ms, respectively). BRT increased with the age of participants and the driving experience shortened PBD and increased PBF.
2:::Four male patients with Fitzpatrick skin types II-III and extensive photodamage on the scalp underwent one treatment with the fractional non-ablative 1,927 nm thulium fiber laser.
3:::135 fetuses at 12-41 weeks underwent post-mortem MRI (followed by conventional autopsy in 92 fetuses). For all organ groups except the brain, and for both modalities, the diagnostic error decreased with gestation (P < 0.0001). 3-T MRI diagnostic error was significantly lower than that of 1.5-T for all anatomic structures and organ groups, except the orbits and brain. This difference was maintained for fetuses <20 weeks gestation. Moreover, 3-T was associated with fewer non-diagnostic scans and greater concordance with classical autopsy than 1.5-T MRI, especially for the thorax, heart and abdomen in fetuses <20 weeks.
2:::We propose a novel method employing three-dimensional (3-D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for false positive reduction in automated pulmonary nodule detection from volumetric computed tomography (CT) scans. Compared with its 2-D counterparts, the 3-D CNNs can encode richer spatial information and extract more representative features via their hierarchical architecture trained with 3-D samples. More importantly, we further propose a simple yet effective strategy to encode multilevel contextual information to meet the challenges coming with the large variations and hard mimics of pulmonary nodules.
3:::The metrics dw, da , dw(NL) , and da(NL) followed T-wave time- and amplitude-induced variations under different levels of noise, were strongly associated with changes in the spatio-temporal dispersion of repolarization, and showed to provide additional information to differences in the heart rate, QT and Tpe intervals, and in the T-wave width and amplitude.
4:::Mobile phone use while riding a motorcycle is highly prevalent among university students. Educational programs should focus on the crash and economic risk of all types of mobile phone use while riding, including calling, texting, and searching for information. In addition, they should consider targeting the influence of social norms and peers on mobile phone use while riding.
3:::Highly significant associations of two informative SNPs (c.2442 T>C, c.3316 C>G [R1106G]) in GRIP1 with BFT traits were detected. In addition, the two SNPs were used to construct haplotypes that were also highly associated with the BFT traits.
2:::A total of 216 1-d-old Arbor Acres male broiler chicks were randomly assigned into three dietary treatments supplemented with 0 (control), 0.14% (MS 0.14%), or 0.28% (MS 0.28%) MS. Each treatment had six replicates (cages) with 12 chicks each. The feeding trial lasted for six weeks.
3:::Abnormal blood glucose was detected in 23.7% of individuals with low activity levels, 14.8% of those with medium activity levels, and 12.2% of those with high activity levels (p<0.003). Similarly, 25.4% of inactive individuals (physically active for <30 minutes per week) were more likely to have abnormal blood glucose levels than active individuals (13.4%, p<0.0001). Higher physical activity was associated with a lower likelihood of abnormal blood glucose in an adjusted Poisson regression.
2:::In 121 (50 normotensive and 71 hypertensive) black women (mean age: 60.6 years), basic cardiovascular assessments including blood pressure and ECG were performed, along with plasma and urinary biomarkers including cTnT.
4:::Neonatal and paediatric patients requiring surgical correction of complex congenital cardiac malformations exhibit extremely low baseline COP, comparable to other sick neonatal populations, and are lower than those previously reported. Baseline COP correlates significantly with predicted survival rates and time spent on a ventilator.
3:::Overall, 151 participants (27.8%) had a current major depressive episode and 406 (82.5%) reported at least one episode of historical childhood trauma. In multivariate analyses, lower QoL total score was associated with a history of childhood trauma (β=-0.21, p<0.0001), psychotic negative symptoms (β=-0.11, p=0.04), current depression (β=-0.0.38, p<0.0001) and male gender (β=-0.16, p<0.0001).
2:::Based on a large nationwide diabetic cohort, 113 051 patients with type 2 diabetes newly on metformin-based dual or triple therapy were identified in 2009-2011 and followed until 2013, or death if this occurred sooner. Primary interest targeted hospitalizations for ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure. Secondary outcomes were hypoglycaemia and all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to assess time-to-event hazard ratio between propensity score-matched antidiabetic treatment groups.
4:::LC patients and control subjects demonstrated similar cerebrovascular stenosis prevalences, whereas white matter lesions were more common in LC patients. A high MELD score and stroke history contribute as predictors of perioperative stroke.
3:::Sixty high-quality RCTs with 6418 participants were included. A pattern of superiority from olanzapine, paliperidone and amisulpride was seen in the primary outcome. Only paliperidone was found better than aripiprazole (odds ratio, 0.49 [95% credible intervals, 0.25 to 0.99]), ziprasidone (0.42 [0.21 to 0.85]) and quetiapine (0.36 [0.13 to 0.93]) in terms of all-cause discontinuation. The best and worst drugs in terms of weight gain, EPS and somnolence were aripiprazole and olanzapine, clozapine and amisulpride, aripiprazole and clozapine, respectively. The rank of efficacy did not change substantially in sensitivity analyses or in meta-regressions.
2:::Parents (including one grandparent) of 37 children aged 4 to 6 years completed measures assessing their perceptions of and satisfaction with services. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with 10 parents to understand their experience with services.
3:::Patients undergoing free flap reconstruction experienced significantly longer mean operative times (482.1 vs. 183.0 minutes, P < .001), were more likely to return to the operating room (odds ratio [OR] = 2.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.33-4.29, P = .003), and had higher likelihood of wound complications (OR = 5.78, 95% CI = 2.72-12.26, P < .001), major morbidity (OR = 12.39, 95% CI = 7.02-21.85, P < .001), and minor morbidity (OR = 4.20, 95% CI = 2.12-8.33, P < .001). There was no difference in mortality between groups (OR = 8.62, 95% CI = 0.53-141.7, P = .131).
1:::Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a disease with bad prognosis. It is usually diagnosed at advanced stages and its treatment is complex. The aim of this consensus document was to provide recommendations by experts that would ameliorate PC diagnosis, reduce the time to treatment, and optimize PC management by interdisciplinary teams.
4:::Although a screening of the asymptomatic population is not a feasible option, special attention to potential symptoms during primary care could ameliorate early diagnostic. It is especially important to decrease the period until diagnostic tests are performed. This consensus could improve survival in PC patients by decreasing the time to diagnose and time to treatment and by the implementation of multidisciplinary teams.
3:::We included 9 case-control and 10 cohort studies with data for 10 856 279 individuals and at least 106 703 fatal and nonfatal ACS events. The pooled maximum-adjusted RR of ACS associated with diabetes was 2.46 (95% CI, 1.92-3.17) in women and 1.68 (95% CI, 1.39-2.04) in men. In patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes, women had a significantly greater risk of ACS-the pooled women-to-men RR and the ratio of relative risks was 1.38 (95% CI, 1.25-1.52; P < .001), with no evidence of publication bias.
2:::We retrospectively reviewed a prospective database to identify 67 consecutive patients who underwent VATS lobectomy for lung cancer by a single surgeon. The learning curve was analyzed by using moving average and the cumulative sum (CUSUM) method. With the moving average and CUSUM analyses for the operation time, patients were stratified into two groups, with chronological order defining early and late experiences. Perioperative clinical outcomes were compared between the two learning curve groups.
4:::We propose a drop-landing task that creates a scalable increase in knee compression loading. The absence of increased knee flexion moment with drop from the low height, compared to high, suggests that individuals could perform the task without incremental risk of knee injury. This task could be used in future studies to examine the effect of acute bouts of mechanical loading on bone and cartilage metabolism.
3:::Naso-intestinal tube placement is more effective than naso-gastric tube in relieving intra abdominal pressures, reducing maximum bowl diameter and waist circumference, correcting serum lactic acid levels, alleviating analgesia dependence, regaining serum albumin level, increasing drainage and shortening the time of length of hospital stay, passing flatus or faces, and time to return to diet.
2:::In order to evaluate the risk of CF, adjusted reporting odds ratios (aRORs) were calculated for the 15 anticancer PKIs in the World Health Organization safety report database (VigiBase®). We realised a literature review to identify 21 protein kinases (PKs) that were possibly involved in CF caused by PKIs. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between aRORs and affinity data of the 15 PKIs for the 21 PKs were calculated to identify the cellular target most likely to be involved in PKI-induced CF.
3:::All subjects used their cochlear implant more than 8 hours a day, 7 days a week. In no tinnitus' patients, mean benefit of cochlear implantation was 19% for quiet speech, 15% for speech in noise (with the same signal-to-noise ratio in the implanted and non-implanted ear), and 16% for a more favourable signal-to-noise ratio at the implanted ear. Sound localization error improved by an average of 19°. The global score of APHAB improved by 16%. The benefits across all evaluations did not differ significantly between the 'no tinnitus' and 'tinnitus' groups.'
4:::Our results do not support an association between rotating night shift work or sleep duration and risk of colorectal adenoma in women.
2:::Individual interviews were conducted with 12 family physicians, 16 abused mothers and three mentor mothers. Four mentor mothers participated in a focus group. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the data.
3:::The identification and discussion of abuse is hindered by family physicians attitudes because they considered mothers experiencing IPV as a difficult target group with a responsibility of their own to break out of their violent situation. Some family physicians doubted the partner's violence because he was known as a patient as well. Acceptance of mentor mother support is related to the readiness for change of mothers experiencing IPV. Mentor mothers facilitate acceptance and completion of their support by connecting as a friend who is equal and less threatening than professionals.'
3:::425 nodules (mean diameter 3.7 ± 2.9 mm) were found on SOR. Overall sensitivity for nodule detection by ultralow dose CT was 91%. In multivariate analysis, nodule type, size and patients BMI were independent predictors for sensitivity (p < 0.001).
4:::Approaching magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy with a single core might be inadequate. Rather, taking 2 cores in the center of the index lesion may provide more accurate cancer detection and optimize the chances of finding the highest Gleason pattern.
2:::We performed a retrospective analysis of administrative claims data of hospitalizations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who received or did not receive positive airway pressure therapy: continuous positive airway pressure, bilevel positive airway pressure, and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation using a home ventilator.
3:::The majority of 1,881,652 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (92.5%) were not receiving any form of positive airway pressure therapy. Prescription of bilevel positive airway pressure (1.5%), continuous positive airway pressure (5.6%), and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (<1%) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrated geographic-, sex-, and age-related variability. After adjusting for confounders and propensity score, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (odds ratio [OR], 0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.27), bilevel positive airway pressure (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.39-0.45), and continuous positive airway pressure (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.67-0.72) were individually associated with lower hospitalization risk in the 6 months post-treatment when compared with the 6 months pretreatment but not when compared with the baseline period between 12 and 6 months before treatment initiation. Stratified analysis suggests that comorbid sleep-disordered breathing, chronic respiratory failure, heart failure, and age less than 65 years were associated with greater benefits from positive airway pressure therapy.
1:::Voltage-dependent K(+) channels (Kv channels) participate in electrical rhythmicity and smooth muscle responses and are regulated by excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Kv channels also participate in the interstitial cell of Cajal (ICC) and smooth muscle cell (SMC) responses to neural inputs. The Kv family consists of 12 subfamilies, Kv1-Kv12, with five members of the Kv7 family identified to date: Kv7.1-Kv7.5. A recent study identified the potassium channel Kv7.5 as having a role in the excitability of ICC-IM in the mouse colon. We therefore designed this study to test the hypothesis that Kv7 channels are present in the normal human colon and are reduced in Hirschprungs disease (HSCR).'
4:::RPA is a useful agent that prevents the formation of CaOx kidney stones.
3:::The study showed that there was no difference between the experimental group and the control group on perioperative mortality (RR = 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [0.49-2.48], P = 0.82) or biliary complications (RR = 0.96, 95%CI = [0.66-1.39], P = 0.83). Preoperative transarterial chemoembolization had no obvious effect on improving overall survival (HR = 1.05, 95%CI = [0.65-1.72], P = 0. 83) but would result in a higher rate of vascular complications (RR = 2.01, 95%CI = [1.23-3.27], P = 0.005) and a reduction of disease free survival (HR = 1.66, 95%CI = [1.02-2.70], P = 0.04). Subgroup analysis also revealed that patients from transarterial chemoembolization group in Asia had a much lower overall survival rate (HR = 2.65, 95%CI = [1.49-4.71], P = 0.0009) compared with the control group.
3:::This study included 31 patients who had been diagnosed as having IFT, comprising 24 men and 7 women with a mean age of 64.7 ± 13.7 years. All patients developed respiratory failure and received mechanical ventilation before diagnosis. Eighteen (58.1%) patients had diabetes mellitus, and 12 (38.7%) had chronic lung disease. Four (12.9%) patients had hematologic disease, and none of the patients had neutropenia. Twenty-five (80.6%) patients were diagnosed as having proven IFT, and the remaining patients had probable IFT. Aspergillus spp. (61.3%) were the most common pathogenic species, followed by Mucorales (25.8%) and Candida spp. (6.5%). The diagnoses in six (19.4%) patients were confirmed only through bronchial biopsy and histopathological examination, whereas their cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were negative for fungi. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 93.5%.
2:::One hundred and fifty-one consecutive patients requiring CECT for acute abdominal pain were included, and their body mass index (BMI) was calculated. CECT was immediately followed by LDCT. LDCT series was processed using 1) 40% iterative reconstruction algorithm blended with filtered back projection (LDCT-IR-FBP) and 2) model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm (LDCT-MBIR). LDCT-IR-FBP and LDCT-MBIR images were reviewed independently by two board-certified radiologists (Raters 1 and 2).
4:::SSWE is feasible and valuable in differentiating BA from non-BA. However, its diagnostic performance does not exceed that of grey-scale US.
3:::Overall, 241/15,756 (1.53%) patients experienced a leak. The occurrence of a leakage resulted in a significant increase of the mortality rate (3.7 vs. 0.2%; p < 0.01). Percent excess weight loss did not differ between leak and non-leak patients, both, at 12 (64.2 vs. 60.9%; p = 1.0) and 24 months (68.5 vs. 64.0%, p = 0.86). Similarly, no significant difference was observed for resolution rate of all comorbid conditions. Matched pair analysis confirmed these findings. Multivariable analysis identified operation time, conversion, intraoperative complications, and hypertension and degenerative joint disease as risk factors for a leak. Oversewing the staple line was associated with the lowest risk.
2:::The Z-scores of the main and bilateral pulmonary arteries and the aorta were measured, and the following variables were calculated in 13 fetuses with tetralogy of Fallot: pulmonary artery-to-aorta ratio and main pulmonary artery cross-section ratio - the main pulmonary artery diameter squared divided by the sum of the diameter squared of the left and right pulmonary arteries. Fetuses were classified as having ductus arteriosus-dependent or ductus arteriosus-independent pulmonary circulation.
3:::When tested in separate analyses, depressive symptoms and burnout facets were each associated with both patient safety measures. Furthermore, the proposed mediation model was supported, with associations between depressive symptoms and patient safety perceptions fully mediated by burnout.
4:::A relevant subset of studies defined as case-control in the area of diabetes correspond to mislabelled cross-sectional studies. Incorrect labelling misleads readers regarding the interpretation of results and the cause-effect hypothesis. Researchers, reviewers and editors should be aware of and commit to settle this issue.
2:::Fifty subjects aging between 20-35 years were included in this study. In the maxillary arch, a lidocaine/prilocaine topical anesthetic was placed around the ginigval margins of the premolar and molar on side. On the other side, a placebo agent was placed around the ginigval margins of the premolar and molar. After two minutes, an elastomeric separator was placed between the premolar and molar on both sides. The subjects were then asked to report their findings on a Verbal Scale and a Visual Analogue Scale every second minute for a period of 10 min. The subjects were also given a questionnaire to evaluate the overall impression on the topical anesthetic use.
3:::During a median follow-up of 23 years, there were 2,632 incident CKD cases. Red and processed meat consumption was associated with increased CKD risk (HRQ5 vs. Q1: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.06-1.42, ptrend = 0.01). In contrast, higher dietary intake of nuts, legumes, and low-fat dairy products was associated with lower CKD risk (nuts: HRQ5 vs. Q1: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.92, ptrend <0.001; low-fat dairy products: HRQ5 vs. Q1: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.65-0.85, ptrend <0.001; legumes: HRQ5 vs. Q1: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.72-0.95, ptrend = 0.03).
3:::The mean RMTs and MEP amplitudes were not significantly different between the MO and HV groups. In patients with MO, the RMTs were negatively correlated with the number of days elapsed since the last migraine attack (rho = -0.404, p = 0.04).
2:::Eight electronic databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science) were searched for relevant studies published up to January 2016. Search terms included oxygen uptake', 'cardiorespiratory fitness', '[Formula: see text] 2max', '[Formula: see text] 2peak', 'scaling' and all interchangeable terms. Inclusion criteria included human cardiorespiratory fitness data; cross-sectional study designs; an empirical derivation of the exponent; reported precision statistics; and reported information regarding participant sex, age and sports background, [Formula: see text] 2max protocol, whole body composition protocol and line-fitting methods. A random-effects model was used to quantify weighted pooled exponents and 95% confidence limits (Cls). Heterogeneity was quantified with the tau-statistic (τ). Meta-regression was used to quantify the impact of selected moderator variables on the exponent effect size. A 95% prediction interval was calculated to quantify the likely range of true fat-free mass exponents in similar future studies, with this distribution used to estimate the probability that an exponent would be above theorised universal values of [Formula: see text].'
4:::In this quantitative synthesis of published studies involving over 6500 humans, the whole body mass exponent was found to be spuriously low and prone to substantial heterogeneity. We conclude that the scaling of [Formula: see text] 2max in humans is consistent with the allometric cascade model with an estimated prediction interval for the fat-free mass exponent not likely to be consistent with the [Formula: see text] power laws.
3:::Histological alterations were detected in 55/76 biopsies. Both modalities showed similar results (sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy 84%, 81%, and 83% for B-mode US versus 85%, 86%, and 86% for SEL, respectively, P > 0.3). However, a combination of both resulted in significant improvement in sensitivity (96%, P < 0.02) without significant change in specificity (81%, P < 0.3), yielding an improved overall accuracy (92%).
2:::For this purpose, forty-two rat pups were divided into six groups based on the timing of betamethasone administration. Rats in the treatment groups were exposed to intraperitoneal betamethasone injections beginning at different time points (postnatal days 1, 2, and 3). Rats in the placebo group received the same volume of 0.9% saline via the same fashion. Pups were sacrificed at 24 h following the final injection for determining the neuronal density and immunohistochemical evaluation of critical growth factors.
3:::Both bio-ADM and lactate were higher in 90-day non-survivors compared to survivors at all time points (P < 0.05 for all). Lactate showed good prognostic value during the initial 24 h (AUC 0.78 at admission and 0.76 at 24 h). Subsequently, lactate returned normal (≤2 mmol/L) in most patients regardless of later outcome with lower prognostic value. By contrast, bio-ADM showed increasing prognostic value from 48 h and beyond (AUC 0.71 at 48 h and 0.80 at 5-10 days). Serial measurements of either bio-ADM or lactate were independent of and provided added value to CardShock risk score (P < 0.001 for both). Ninety-day mortality was more than double higher in patients with high levels of bio-ADM (>55.7 pg/mL) at 48 h compared to those with low bio-ADM levels (49.1 vs. 22.6%, P = 0.001). High levels of bio-ADM were associated with impaired cardiac index, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure during the study period. Furthermore, high levels of bio-ADM at 48 to 96 h were related to persistently impaired cardiac and end-organ function.
4:::Bio-ADM is a valuable prognosticator and marker of impaired hemodynamics in CS patients. High levels of bio-ADM may show shock refractoriness and developing end-organ dysfunction and thus help to guide therapeutic approach in patients with CS. Study identifier of CardShock study NCT01374867 at clinicaltrials.gov.
3:::In HPT, no difference in latency was observed at P16; however, at P30 and P60, the morphine-treated group exhibited a less increase in the nociceptive threshold compared to the saline group. VFT and RST demonstrated an interaction between group and age, where the morphine group showed a less pronounced increase in latency with age, which is indicative of allodynia. In the cerebral cortex, an association between BDNF and NGF levels and age was observed, where neurotrophin level increased with age in the saline group, and decreased with age in the morphine group. In addition, IL-10 levels decreased with age in both groups; however, there was no significant difference in IL-6 levels. In the brainstem, BDNF, NGF, IL-6, and IL-10 levels increased with age.
2:::The effects of different constellations of comorbidities on objectively measured lifestyle exercise were examined using data from a randomized controlled trial testing lifestyle behavior change interventions in patients with cardiac events (n = 379) who completed a phase 2 CRP. Adjusting for important covariates, the relationships between the primary outcome, exercise amount, and the presence of common chronic conditions (hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and arthritis) were studied using robust linear mixed-effects models.
4:::Our results may reflect an abnormal function of the motor areas or an effort to counterbalance the pathological motor output.
1:::The present study identified the prognostic factors and outcomes for malignant sublingual salivary gland tumors, which are rare.
3:::Of the 38 patients, 16 (42.1%) were men. Their mean age was 53 years (range 36 to 75). A total of 11 patients (28.9%) had T3-T4 tumors, and 6 (15.8%) had positive neck lymph nodes. The recurrence rate at 5 years was 18.4%. The distant metastasis rate at 5 years was 23.7%. Multivariable analysis confirmed the independent prognostic importance of patient age, N stage, and limited tongue mobility in locoregional recurrence and mortality at 5 years.
2:::This descriptive, case-control study consisted of 33 women with healthy pregnancies and 22 women with ICP in the third trimester of gestation. Maternal liver elasticity measurements were performed by ARFI elastosonography. The maternal characteristics and perinatal outcomes of the participants were also collected.
3:::In the primary analysis set (N=500), 187 patients had CTD-PAH, of whom 118 had SSc-PAH. Initial combination therapy reduced the risk of clinical failure versus pooled monotherapy in each subgroup: CTD-PAH (HR 0.43 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.77)) and SSc-PAH (0.44 (0.22 to 0.89)). The most common AE was peripheral oedema, which was reported more frequently with initial combination therapy than monotherapy in the two PAH subgroups. The relative frequency of adverse events between those on combination therapy versus monotherapy was similar across subgroups.
4:::This systematic review highlights the strong emphasis placed on the alleviation of pain to allow HSI rehabilitation progression, and the reliance on subjective clinical assessments and performance tests as RTP criteria. These results suggest a need for more objective and clinically practical criteria, allowing a more evidence-based approach to rehabilitation progression, and potentially reducing the ambiguity involved in the RTP decision-making process.
3:::Persons with NP (n = 40) preferred to train on ""lifting"", ""prolonged sitting"" and ""driving a car"". Persons with LBP (n = 40) preferred to train on ""household activities"", ""lifting"" and ""prolonged walking"". Motives were predominantly ""ability to work"" and ""ability to do free time occupations"". Preferences shifted in ranking but remained the same during rehabilitation. Participants were familiar with the surveyed technologies.
2:::Schoolchildren aged 7-11 years were sampled from one urban and two rural regions. Skin prick tests (SPT) and specific IgE (sIgE) against food and aeroallergens were measured, and data on allergic symptoms and on demographic and socioeconomic factors were collected by questionnaire. Diagnosis of opisthorchiasis was based on PCR performed on stool samples.
1:::Several studies have evaluated the association between ABO blood group and the prognosis of various types of cancer; however, little is known about the relationship between ABO blood group and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We investigated how ABO blood group and clinicopathological characteristics are related to the survival of Japanese patients with esophageal SCC.
3:::The prevalence of each blood group was as follows: A, 35.5%; B, 22.4%; O, 32.8%; and AB, 8.2%. The 5-year overall survival of all patients was 37.1%. Patients with non-type B blood had significantly worse 5-year overall survival than those with type B blood (30.2 vs. 58.8%, P < 0.05).
4:::The safety of olprinone in liver surgery was confirmed. The efficacy of olprinone will be re-evaluated in clinical trials.
2:::Seventy-six children diagnosed with WT and admitted to Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital between 2004 and 2012 were studied prospectively. Nutritional assessment was conducted using weight, height, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and triceps skinfold thickness (TSFT) prior to initiating treatment. Outcome was determined 2 years after admission. Time until commencement of nutritional resuscitation and nature, thereof, were recorded.
3:::Pancreatic malignancies were found in 202 patients (84.5% of the study population). EUS-FNA detected malignancies with 96% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 92%-98%); 4 passes of EUS-FNA detected malignancies with 92% sensitivity (95% CI, 87%-95%). Tumor size greater than 2 cm was the only variable associated with positive results from cytology analysis (odds ratio, 7.8; 95% CI, 1.9-31.6). In masses larger than 2 cm, 4 passes of EUS-FNA detected malignancies with 93% sensitivity (95% CI, 89%-96%) and in masses ≤2 cm, 6 passes was associated with 82% sensitivity (95% CI, 61%-93%). Sensitivity of detection did not increase with increasing number of passes.
2:::Three hundred eighty-two women 45 years and older were recruited including 131 women with osteoporosis and 251 controls following bone mineral density (BMD) measurement, 287 completed questionnaires of the different risk assessment tools. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were evaluated for each tool using bone BMD as the gold standard for osteoporosis.
4:::Simple self-assessment tools like FRAX without BMD, SCORE, and the IOF One Minute Tests were valid for predicting Palestinian postmenopausal women at high risk of developing osteoporosis.
3:::Of the 344 (12%) women reporting smoking during pregnancy, about 40% continued throughout pregnancy and 13% reported smoking more than 1 pack per day. After covariate adjustment and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, maternal smoking throughout pregnancy remained significantly associated with increased levels of IL-8 (β = 0.20, 95% confidence interval: 0.07, 0.32; p < .003). No significant associations were found with cigarette load or secondhand smoke exposure. Higher IgG3 levels were also associated with maternal smoking throughout pregnancy, although the association became nominally significant after adjustment for covariates (β = 0.09; 95% confidence interval: 0.0007, 0.17; p < .05).
2:::Liver specimens were obtained from five patients with cirrhosis, five with chronic hepatitis, and five without hepatic fibrosis. WFA(+) -M2BP kinetics were evaluated histologically and in subpopulations of liver cells such as HSCs, KCs, endothelial cells, biliary epithelial cells, and hepatocytes in in vitro culture. The function of WFA(+) -M2BP in activated HSCs was evaluated using immunoblot analysis.
4:::WFA(+) -M2BP from HSCs induces Mac-2 expression in KCs, which in turn activates HSCs to be fibrogenic.
3:::The eosinophils of patients with EoE were significantly more activated than those of control individuals. The lowest percentage of normal eosinophils for control subjects was 40%, while the highest percentage of eosinophils of normal aspect for patients with EoE was 32%. Considering 36% as a cutoff for normal eosinophils, this value differentiated all individuals with EoE from individuals without the disease with a sensitivity of 100%, considering the diagnosis of EoE as currently defined. Eosinophils of EoE patients showed higher expression of cyclooxygenase-2 than those of control subjects.
2:::A primary cohort consisting of 110 patients pathologically diagnosed with grade II glioma was retrospectively studied. The radiomics method developed in this paper includes image segmentation, high-throughput feature extraction, radiomics sequencing, feature selection and classification. Using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method, the classification result was compared with the real IDH1 situation from Sanger sequencing. Another independent validation cohort containing 30 patients was utilised to further test the method.
3:::Coat colour of Qingyu pig is associated with the polymorphisms of MC1R but not ASIP. We only found 2 haplotypes, E(QY) and E(qy) , based on the 13 observed mutations from MC1R gene. Among which, E(qy) presented a recessive inheritance mode in black spotted Qingyu pigs. Further analysis revealed a g.462-463CC insertion that caused a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon, thus changed the first transmembrane domain completely and lost the remaining six transmembrane domains. Altogether, our results strongly support that the variety of Qingyu pigs coat colour is related to MC1R.'
4:::Patients with type 1 and 2 DM had deteriorated functional capability of macrocirculation. However, endothelial dysfunction of microcirculation was present only in type 2 DM patients. Type 2 DM patients were also at higher risk for atherosclerosis because of the more frequent presence of risk factors.
3:::Of the 90 papers identified, 28 were eligible for inclusion. Eight trials used opt-out, 18 trials used opt-in, and two trials used both to detect new cases of HIV infection. The test was accepted and taken by 75 155 of 172 237 patients (44%) in the opt-out strategy, and 73 581 of 382 992 patients (19%) in the opt-in strategy. The prevalence of HIV infection detected by the opt-out strategy was 0.40% (373 cases), that detected by the opt-in nontargeted strategy was 0.52% (419 cases), and that detected by the opt-in targeted strategy was 1.06% (52 cases).
2:::278 patients with AGC who underwent preoperative multiphasic dynamic CT were retrospectively recruited. Tumour CT attenuation difference between non-contrast and arterial (ΔAP), portal (ΔPP) and delayed phase (ΔDP), tumour-spleen attenuation difference in the portal phase (ΔT-S), tumour contrast enhancement ratios (CERs), tumour-to-spleen ratio (TSR) and tumour volumes were obtained. All CT-derived parameters and clinicopathological variables associated with LVI were analysed by univariate analysis, followed by multivariate and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis. Associations between CT predictors for LVI and histopathological characteristics were evaluated by the chi-square test.
3:::A total of 939 participants, consisting of 436 men and 503 women, were enrolled. Serum levels of A-FABP were much higher in participants with microalbuminuria than those without microalbuminuria. This result held true for all subgroups (all P < 0.05). For Spearmans correlation analyses, serum A-FABP levels showed a positive relationship with the UACR in men and women (both P < 0.01). Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that serum A-FABP levels were independently and positively correlated with UACR in both sexes (men: standardized β = 0.256, P < 0.001; women: standardized β = 0.155, P = 0.001). This relationship remained significant in every subgroup (all P < 0.01).'
4:::Children with CF who achieve higher WFL at age two years have improved pulmonary and survival outcomes into adulthood. CF providers should continue to utilize current early growth recommendations, with goal WFL ≥50th percentile on CDC growth charts before age two.
2:::In this study, we measured EtCO2 and severity of seasickness using the subjective symptoms of motion sickness (SSMS). We sampled EtCO2 and SSMS every 3-4h for 3 days from the date of sail in 16 healthy subjects. This experiment was performed on an icebreaker (standard displacement: 12,650t).
3:::The model provided a close fit to the data (χ21=17.02; P=0.71; root-mean-square error of approximation=0.00; normal fit index=0.97; comparative fit index=1.0). The model demonstrates the direct and indirect effects of childhood sexual abuse on state and trait psychosocial factors among individuals with chronic pain. Pain anxiety, maladaptive worrying, and pain intensity were the main determinants of pain-related disability.
1:::Long-term care (LTC) residents with cognitive impairments frequently experience limited mobility and participation in preferred activities. Although a power wheelchair could mitigate some of these mobility and participation challenges, this technology is often not prescribed for this population due to safety concerns. An intelligent power wheelchair (IPW) system represents a potential intervention that could help to overcome these concerns. The purpose of this study was to explore a) how residents experienced an IPW that used three different modes of control and b) what perceived effect the IPW would have on their daily lives.
4:::Our findings warrant an increased awareness of the risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage in women conceiving with assisted reproductive technology. Furthermore, the high risk of severe postpartum haemorrhage in the presence of a twin or triplet pregnancy is an additional argument for single embryo transfer.
3:::SUV-based variables and TLG obtained in the PET-1 and PET-2 showed high and significant correlations between them. MTV and SUV variables (SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUVpeak) where only marginally correlated. Significant differences were found between mean SUV variables and TLG obtained in PET-1 and PET-2. High and significant associations were found between metabolic variables obtained in PET-1 and their homonymous in PET-2. Based on that, only relations of PET-1 variables with biological tumor characteristics were explored. SUV variables showed associations with hormone receptors status (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001 for estrogen and progesterone receptor, respectively) and risk-classification according to phenotype (SUVmax, p = 0.003; SUVmean, p = 0.004; SUVpeak, p = 0.003). As to volume-based variables, only TLG showed association with hormone receptors status (estrogen, p < 0.001; progesterone, p = 0.031), risk-classification (p = 0.007), and grade (p = 0.036). Hormone receptor negative tumors, high-grade tumors, and high-risk phenotypes showed higher TLG values. No association was found between the metabolic variables and Ki-67, HER2, or p53 expression.
2:::Nasal tissue was obtained from patients with CRS and control subjects. Tissue homogenates were analyzed for complement activation products (ELISA-C5b-9, C4d, activated C1, and C5a) and major complement-fixing antibodies (Luminex). Tissue sections were stained for C5b-9, C4d, and laminin. Antibodies were purified with protein A/G columns from nasal polyps (NP), matching patient serum, and control serum and assayed for basement membrane binding by means of ELISA.
3:::YKL-40 immunoreactivity intensity in the percreta group was significantly higher compared to the increta and accreta groups (2.47±0.74, 1.33±0.49 and 1.37±0.52, respectively; P=0.000). YKL-40 immunoreactivity intensity was positively correlated with creta (r=0.6; P=0.000), depth of invasion (r=0.49; P=0.003) and depth of invasion to full thickness ratio (r=0.58; P=0.000).
4:::Our findings demonstrate that stratification of OA cases into more homogeneous endophenotypes can identify genes of potential functional importance otherwise obscured by disease heterogeneity.
2:::In this prospective trial, 37 patients undergoing PVE were examined before and 14 and 28 days after PVE and 10 days after extended hemihepatectomy using Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. Lobar volume, kinetic growth rate (KGR), relative enhancement (RE) as well as hepatocellular uptake index (HUI) and fat signal fraction (FSF) were calculated for each lobe.
3:::We evaluated 239 calcified segments. In all the segments, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy for detecting significant stenosis were respectively 88%, 88%, 75%, 95% and 88% for the MD images, 91%, 71%, 56%, 95% and 77% for the VM images. PPV was significantly higher on the MD images than on the VM images (P < 0.0001).
4:::Characterizing GSV with minimum volume loading, DOL-test shows the degree of preservation of muscular-tonic properties of GSV and allows to predict the reversibility of the GSV reflux after phlebectomy. Being initially high, the GSV OG points that the potential of muscular-tonic function is saved. Its decrease after the surgery proves the decrease of the volume loading on GSV.
3:::Twenty percent of subjects were homozygous for two 28 bp repeats (2R/2R, where 2R is two 28-nucleotide repeats within the 5 untranslated region [UTR] of the thymidylate synthase [TS] gene) within the 5' UTR of the gene for TS. This 2R/2R genotype was associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis among children younger than 10 years at diagnosis (multivariable hazard ratio [HR] 2.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-5.95; P = 0.013), and with bone fracture among children ≥ 10 years (multivariable HR 2.10; 95% CI 1.11-3.96; P = 0.022). No significant association was observed between TS genotype and red blood cell (RBC) folate, RBC MTX, or relapse risk.'
2:::Thirty liver phantoms with or without simulated hypervascular lesions were scanned with a 320-slice CT scanner with control-dose (40 mAs) and reduced-dose (30 and 20 mAs) settings. Control-dose images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), and reduced-dose images were reconstructed with FBP and a hybrid IR algorithm. Objective image noise and the lesion to liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were evaluated quantitatively. Images were interpreted independently by 2 blinded radiologists, and jackknife alternative free-response receiver-operating characteristic (JAFROC) analysis was performed.
3:::The GST inhibition activity of Kanji (100.00 μg/mL), methanol extract of D. carota roots (100.00 μg/mL) and tannic acid (10.00 μg/mL, positive control) was found to be 0.162 ± 0.016, 0.106 ± 0.013 and 0.073 ± 0.004 μM/min/mg, respectively. Different Kanji samples and methanol extract contained ferulic acid (0.222-0.316 mg/g) and 0.77 mg/g, respectively. Ferulic acid did not appear in plasma after oral administration of Kanji.
4:::ASTX reduced blood coagulation and platelet aggregation and promoted fibrinolytic activity in hyperlipidemic rats. These activities were closely correlated with ASTX, maintaining the balance of t-PA/PAI-1, NO/ROS and TXA2/PGI2 in vivo.
3:::In 20 cases, intraventricular and periventricular haemorrhages were detected. The other cases showed sinuses in the cerebral falx, specifically in the back parts of the falx, and were described as oblique, straight, wavy, or network. A very rich venous network is located around the superior sagittal sinus; the middle section grew twice its length and the back section grew three times its width, reaching the lowest areas of the cerebral falx, the inferior sagittal sinus, and the straight sinus. Anastomotic intersinual loops appeared. There were three forms of venous weave crescents: isolated limited to the area adjacent to the superior sagittal sinus, partly merging with the straight sinus and a fully developed falcine sinus, which appeared in the older age groups with the most primitive forms being plexiform. Their remains a plurality of channels within the same superior sagittal sinus that show a predominance in the posterior segment.
2:::We have developed a new method of esophagogastrostomy, side overlap with fundoplication by Yamashita (SOFY). The remnant stomach is fixated to the diaphragmatic crus on the dorsal side of the esophagus. The esophagus and the remnant stomach are overlapped by a length of 5 cm. A linear stapler is inserted in two holes on the left side of the esophageal stump and the anterior gastric wall. The stapler is rotated counterclockwise on its axis and fired. The entry hole is closed, and the right side of the esophagus is fixated to the stomach so that the esophagus sticks flat to the gastric wall. The surgical outcomes of the SOFY method were compared with those of esophagogastrectomy different from SOFY.
4:::Physicians are strongly influenced by a representativeness bias, leading to base-rate neglect, even though they understand the application of statistical probability. One of the causes for this representativeness bias may be the way clinical medicine is taught where stereotypic presentations are emphasised in diagnostic decision making.
3:::With an increase in relative light intensity levels, activities of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were increased overall, while net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and dry matter accumulation patter first increased and then declined. The highest net photosynthetic rate (30.68 μmol/m(2)·s) and dry root weight (5.07 g) were achieved under 60.54% sunlight. Lower relative light intensity levels stimulated the accumulation levels of bioactive compounds in the roots so that the highest contents of mannitol (1.35%) and choline (405.58 μg/g) were recorded under 31.39% sunlight, and the highest polysaccharide content (10.80%) were achieved under 44.84% sunlight. With a decrease in the relative light intensity levels, the water-soluble component content increased first and then decreased.
3:::Oral administration of NTU101F in DOCA-salt hypertension-induced VaD rats resulted in a significant decrease in blood pressure by 18.3-23.2% (p < 0.001), which was regulated by increasing eNOS density (about 3-fold) in the aorta, promoting NO production, and decreasing of matrix metallopeptidase 9 activity (about 2-fold) in the hippocampus, in addition to improve the kidney function and structure, decrease escape latency and increase the times spent in the target quadrant by 23.5-27.8% (p < 0.05).
2:::Two hundred fifteen NAFLD patients with LSM, FM NAFLD, FM VCTE, and other serum tests (aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, fibrosis-4 index, BARD score, NAFLD fibrosis score, and aspartate aminotransferase-to-alanine aminotransferase ratio) performed 1 day before liver biopsy were evaluated.
4:::We reported favorable surgical outcomes of TLTG using the overlap method. It is a feasible and safe option for treatment of gastric cancer.
3:::25 447 patients met inclusion criteria. Overall, 62% of the cohort received neoadjuvant chemoradiation and 32% had suboptimal LNY. The median LNY for patients who received neoadjuvant therapy was 13 (IQR: 9-18) and for patients who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy was 15 (IQR: 12-21). After risk adjustment, there was a 3.5-fold difference in the rate of suboptimal LNY among individual hospitals (27%-95%). Suboptimal LNY was independently associated with an 18% increased hazard of death among patients who did not receive neoadjuvant treatment and a 20% increased hazard of death among those who did receive neoadjuvant treatment when controlled for adjuvant treatment, staging, proximal/distal margins and other patient factors.
3:::Sixty-four participants were tested (14 novices, 19 intermediates, 31 experts). The largest difference in MAPs was seen in the double-throw knot' segment. MAPs for the 'loading needle/pull-through' segment revealed differences between novices and experts in Roll and Pitch DOFs only. For the 'first single knot' segment, similar MAP trends were noted across all DOFs, with significant differences between novices versus experts and intermediates versus experts. For the 'second single knot' segment, the difference in MAPs was preserved only for novices versus experts.'
4:::BLIN showed a significant curative effect on DVH. The antioxidative and hepatoprotective effects of BLIN made great contributions to the treatment of DVH. Furthermore, BLIN is expected to be exploited as a new drug for the clinical treatment of DVH.
3:::The results showed that ACEI significantly reduced the haemoglobin (Hb, 10.0 g/dL), packed cell volume (PCV, 39.5%), red blood cells (RBCs, 6.2 million/mm(3)), mean corpuscular volume (MCV, 53.5 fL) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH, 16.2 pg/cell) values. In the group treated with ASP, the Hb (13.7 g/dL) and RBCs (7.8 million/mm(3)) increased significantly (p < 0.05). The combination of ASP and ACEI led to the significant (p < 0.05) reduction in Hb (10.7 g/dL), PCV (33.3%), RBCs (6.0 million/mm(3)), MCV (54.42 fL) and MCH (16.44 pg/cell) values. While histopathological examination of the liver and kidney cells showed a mild degree of toxicity in the ASP-treated group.
1:::This pilot study investigated the possible transfer effect on reading ability in children with reading difficulties after a systematic intervention to train and compensate for reading deficiencies by using applications in smartphones and tablets. The effects of using assistive technology (AT) one year after the interventions were completely studied. School related motivation, independent learning and family relations were also considered.
2:::We asked 45 novice subjects to complete peg transfers using the da Vinci IS 1200 system with grasper-mounted, normal force sensors. The task involves picking up a peg with one of the robotic arms, passing it to the other arm, and then placing it on the opposite side of the view. Subjects were divided into three groups: aligned group (no mismatch), the misaligned group (10 cm z axis mismatch), and the haptics-misaligned group (haptic feedback and z axis mismatch). Each subject performed the task five times, during which the grip force, time of completion, and number of faults were recorded.
3:::A total of 55.2% of children aged 12-15 months continued to be breastfed at the time of questioning. Of the study population, 61.5% achieved minimum dietary diversity, 70.8% achieved minimum meal frequency and 43.0% achieved minimum acceptable diet. Older children were more likely to achieve minimum dietary diversity and minimum acceptable diet; however, they were also less likely to achieve minimum meal frequency. High levels of hygiene practices were reported in all areas of food safety.
4:::Cutaneous nevus count may represent a novel marker for development of Type 2 diabetes, suggesting a possible unique melanocytic nevus-related mechanism in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes. Further studies are warranted to confirm the findings and to investigate the underlying mechanisms.
2:::A retrospective analysis of two national surveys, the 2011 National Health and Aging Trends Study and the National Study of Caregiving was performed. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between demographic and caregiving variables with caregiver involvement in three medication management activities.
3:::The overall accuracy rate declined from 80.4% in the first test to 62.0% in the second test (p<0.0001). The accuracy rate of all the heart murmurs was similar in the first (81.3%) and second tests (77.5%). That of all the heart sounds (S2/S3/S4) decreased from 79.9% to 54.3% in the second test (p<0.0001). The individual accuracy rate decreased in the second test as compared with the first test in all three S2s, S3, and S3+S4 (p<0.0001).
2:::National policies regulating e-cigarettes were identified by (1) conducting web searches on Ministry of Health websites, and (2) broad web searches. The mechanisms used to regulate e-cigarettes were classified as new/amended laws, or existing laws. The policy domains identified include restrictions or prohibitions on product: sale, manufacturing, importation, distribution, use, product design including e-liquid ingredients, advertising/promotion/sponsorship, trademarks, and regulation requiring: taxation, health warning labels and child-safety standards. The classification of the policy was reviewed by a country expert.
3:::The search identified 68 countries that regulate e-cigarettes: 22 countries regulate e-cigarettes using existing regulations; 25 countries enacted new policies to regulate e-cigarettes; 7 countries made amendments to existing legislation; 14 countries use a combination of new/amended and existing regulation. Common policies include a minimum-age-of-purchase, indoor-use (vape-free public places) bans and marketing restrictions. Few countries are applying a tax to e-cigarettes.
4:::A range of regulatory approaches are being applied to e-cigarettes globally; many countries regulate e-cigarettes using legislation not written for e-cigarettes.
3:::Cases with intact visual acuity demonstrated lower grades of foveal hypoplasia on optical coherence tomography, while those with poor vision demonstrated high grades of foveal hypoplasia. The superficial retinal capillary plexus was intact in the foveal area in all cases, with no demonstrable foveal avascular zone. The deep retinal capillary plexus was absent to variable degrees in most cases, but was most persistent in those cases with reduced vision.
2:::This study recruited 105 chronic pain patients to use a smartphone pain app and half of the patients (N=52) had 2-way messaging available through the app. All patients completed baseline measures and were asked to record their progress every day for 3 months, with the opportunity to continue for 6 months. All participants were supplied a Fitbit to track daily activity. Summary line graphs were posted to each of the patients electronic medical records and physicians were notified of their patient's progress.'
4:::The present findings show that Ang-(1-7) protects from HG-stimulated damage as an inhibitor of the reactive oxygen species-leptin-p38 MAPK/ERK1/2 pathways, but not the leptin-c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway in vitro.
1:::To review the current literature on robotic assistance for ophthalmic surgery, especially vitreoretinal procedures.
3:::According to the results of exploratory analyses, passenger age and vehicle maneuver are associated with passenger injury severity in all 3 types of accidents. Moreover, the variable ""skidding and overturning"" is associated with injury severity of seated passengers and driver age is correlated with injury severity of standing and boarding/alighting passengers.
2:::We analyzed all laparoscopic appendectomies (lap-ap), cholecystectomies (lap-chole), and inguinal hernia repairs (IHR) performed before and after implementing a GRSP.
3:::Operative time significantly increased for lap-ap (p < 0.0001), lap-chole (p < 0.0001) and IHR (p = 0.03). Time to close the incision significantly increased for lap-ap (p < 0.0001), lap-chole (p = 0.006) and IHR (p = 0.03). Length of stay only increased for lap-ap (p = 0.04). Complication rates did not increase for any procedure. However, charges significantly increased for lap-ap (p < 0.0001), lap-chole (p < 0.0001), and IHR (p = 0.03).
4:::ACER is a viable option in limbal transplantation that reduces multiple patient visits, bleeding and pain that can be associated with SSCE.
3:::The mean density of vGAT+/CB+ cartridges was 2.7-fold higher, exclusively in layer 2 of schizophrenia subjects, whereas the density of vGAT+/CB- cartridges did not differ between subject groups. Neither vGAT, CB, or GAD67 protein levels per ChC bouton nor the number of boutons per cartridge differed between subject groups.
2:::A hospital-based case-control study (n = 480) was conducted in Pune, India. We assessed risk factors for UADT cancers by administering a questionnaire through face-to-face interviews. We developed a risk factor model based on the statistically significant risk factors in multiple logistic regression. A total, single risk score was calculated per individual based on the adjusted odds ratio for each of their risk factors. Standard receiver operator characteristic curve was plotted for the total score and the presence of UADT cancers. The stratification ability of the model was determined using the c-statistic. The optimal criterion value was determined at the point on curve at which the Youdens index was maximal. Confidence intervals were calculated by bootstrapping.'
3:::The reproducibility of the direct method was higher than that of the conventional method in CC and MLO views (P = 0.002, P < 0.001). The median 3D clip-to-calcification distance was 2.8 mm, with an interquartile range of 2.0-4.8 mm and a range of 1.1-36.3 mm.
4:::Although there was little indication of an avoidant decisional style in cannabis users, the results suggest that cannabis affects decisional processes, contributing to panic in females and impulsivity in males.
2:::Fifty-three patients (37.9 ± 20.6 years old) with either rotator cuff tear (21 patients), superior labrum anterior-to-posterior (SLAP) lesion (7 patients), or Bankart lesion (25 patients) of one shoulder were administered three manual muscle resistance tests (abduction strength, external rotation, and belly press tests). Positive results in these tests were defined as a subjective weakness in the involved shoulder compared to the opposite shoulder. Based on this result, the patients were divided into positive and negative groups. Another observer measured isometric strength using a hand-held dynamometer and calculated the side-to-side ratio. Comparing instrument measurement with manual measurement, the cut-off point, at which we can recognise that there is a side-to-side difference, was calculated by receiver operating characteristic analysis.
3:::Compared with normal tissues, primary cilia frequency was significantly elevated in adenocarcinoma of the lung (2.75% vs 1.85%, p=0.016), adenocarcinoma of the colon (3.80% vs 2.43%, respectively, p=0.017), follicular lymphoma (1.18% vs 0.83%, p=0.003) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (7.00% vs 5.26%, p=0.002); there was no statistically significant difference compared with normal control tissue for gastric and prostatic adenocarcinomas or for lobular and ductal breast cancers. Additionally, structural abnormalities of primary cilia were identified in cancer tissues, including elongation of the axoneme, multiple basal bodies and branching of the axoneme. Ki-67 scores ranged from 0.7% to 78.4% and showed no statistically significant correlation with primary cilia frequency across all tissues (p=0.1501).
3:::We found that adult astrocyte-specific Fmr1 KO mice displayed increased spine density in the motor cortex and impaired motor-skill learning. The learning defect coincided with a lack of enhanced spine dynamics in the motor cortex that normally occurs in response to motor skill acquisition. Although spine density was normal at 1 month of age in astrocyte-specific Fmr1 KO mice, new spines formed at an elevated rate. Furthermore, fragile X mental retardation protein expression in only astrocytes was insufficient to rescue most spine or behavioral defects.
4:::There was insufficient evidence to support the use of ultrasound, infrared light or transillumination. Interventions to reduce childrens pain did not decrease first attempt success. Research examining between-clinician proficiency and persistence differences is absent.'
2:::CINAHL, Cochrane, EBSCO, PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus databases were sought from 2009-March 2015. The final data consisted of eight studies described in 10 articles. The study design was RCT in three studies, CBA in three and ITS in two studies. The studies were assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data were summarised narratively and displayed in a harvest plot.
3:::SILS and TRD setups create similar amounts of stray current as measured by increased tissue temperature at the non-electrically active telescope tip (41 ± 12 vs. 39 ± 10 °C; p = 0.71). Stray current was greater in SILS compared to TRD at the tip of the non-electrically active Maryland forceps (38 ± 9 vs. 20 ± 10 °C; p < 0.01). Separation of the active electrode and camera cords did not change the amount of stray energy in the SILS orientation for either telescope (39 ± 10 °C bundled vs. 36 ± 10 °C separated; p = 0.40) or grasper (38 ± 9 °C bundled vs. 34 ± 11 °C separated; p = 0.19) but did in the TRD orientation (41 ± 12 bundled vs. 24 ± 10 separated; p < 0.01). When SILS was compared to TRD with the cords separated, SILS increased stray energy at both the telescope tip and grasper tip (36 ± 10 vs. 24 ± 10 °C; p < 0.01 and 34 ± 11 vs. 17 ± 8 °C; p < 0.01).
4:::The IADPSG criteria doubled the number of GDM patients. The cases of the increment patients were mild. The IADPSG criteria should be discussed fully before implementation in China.
3:::A number of factors related to burnout in female nurses with children aged under 3 years was found via a multiple regression analysis: irritation at being unable to attend to their own affairs, over 4-6 h of overtime work per week, having a child aged under 3 years as the first or second child, little sense of work fulfillment, using a childcare facility outside the workplace, dissatisfaction with their salary, feeling ill-qualified as a parent, and a sense of inadequate support.
1:::To determine whether systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) affecting subcortical white matter volumes, deep gray matter volumes, and cortical thickness differ between groups of SLE patients with psychiatric (P-SLE), neurological (N-SLE), or nonneuropsychiatric (non-NPSLE) presentations.
2:::The participants in the experimental group carried out the Senior Elastic Band exercise programme for six months (three times per week and 40 minutes per session) in addition to their daily activities. The participants in the control group maintained their daily activities. The participants self-perceived health status and sleep quality were examined at the baseline, three-month interval and six-month interval.'
3:::Thirteen of 133 (10%) patients undergoing parotid sialendoscopy for chronic sialadenitis had more than one calcification in the region of the parotid gland. Seven patients (54%) were diagnosed with immune-mediated disease from autoimmune parotitis (positive Sjögrens antibodies or antinuclear antibodies) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. The six patients (46%) who did not have an immune-mediated disorder had most calcifications located anterior or along the masseter muscle. Eight of 13 patients (61%) had at least one calculus found in the parotid duct on sialendoscopy. Four patients (38%) had multiple punctate calcifications within the parotid gland, all of whom had either autoimmune parotitis or HIV. None of the proximal or punctate parotid calcifications posterior to the masseter were visualized on sialendoscopy.'
4:::Chronic parotitis in conjunction with multiple parotid calcifications is uncommon and was identified in 10% of our cohort. We contrast two classifications of parotid calcifications: 1) intraductal stones that cause recurrent duct obstruction and are often located within the main parotid duct along or anterior to the masseter and 2) punctate intraparenchymal parotid gland calcifications that are not visualized on sialendoscopy and may represent underlying inflammatory disease.
2:::The eye care educational programme was developed based on literature review and survey of educational needs. Thirty intensive care unit nurses served as subjects for the study.
3:::Means (±SD) of humeral inclination, medial wall angle of the bicipital groove, and radius of the humeral head values were 135 ± 11°, 39 ± 19°, and 14 ± 3 mm, respectively. Means (±SD) of glenoid height and width were 35 ± 4 and 26 ± 4 mm, while the means (±SD) of the angles of glenoid inclination, retroversion, and rotation were 87 ± 32°, 96 ± 10°, and 9 ± 6°, respectively. A significant difference in glenoid height (P ≤ 0.002) and width (P ≤ 0.0001) was observed between males and females, despite them having almost an identical radius of the humeral head, glenoid inclination, retroversion, and angle of rotation. There was also a significant difference (P ≤ 0.01) in the angle of glenoid retroversion between the right and left sides.
4:::In a matched analysis, laparoscopic Ladds led to shorter hospital stays than open Ladd's in the initial 30-day postoperative period. Short-term benefits of laparoscopic Ladd's lend support for using additional resources to perform multi-institutional studies to compare differences in long-term outcomes between laparoscopic and open Ladd's.'
2:::We quantify the role of Helicobacter pylori in excess gastric cancer incidence in Māori and Pacific men in New Zealand. Age-standardized gastric cancer rate ratios for 1981-2004 were calculated in Māori and Pacific men compared with European/other men born in 1926-1940 and in 1941-1955. Rate ratios were then compared with those restricted to H. pylori prevalent populations.
3:::51 eyes with different DR severities were imaged. More severe DR was significantly associated with lower PI after adjusting for logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution best-corrected visual acuity, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes type and ETDRS ring in a multivariate mixed linear model. Compared with the none-mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) group, the moderate-severe NPDR group had 2.7 lower PI (p=0.03) and proliferative DR group had 4.3 lower PI (p=0.003). All ETDRS zones except for the foveal centre showed inverse associations between PI and DR severity (p values<0.001 to 0.862).
4:::The biceps pulley system, including the SGHL/CHL complex and subscapularis tendon, merits recognition as an important anatomical structure, and its lesions contribute to shoulder pathology. The subscapularis tendon is very important for the stability of the LHBT and should be included in the pulley system. In cases of a tear associated with a lesion of the SGHL/CHL complex, the LHBT is nearly always unstable and pathologic.
3:::SF rats showed markedly reduced inulin clearance associated with hyperoxaluria, renal tubular damage, increased oxidative stress and inflammation. NAC treatment ameliorated all these alterations. Under polarized light microscopy, SF rats exhibited intense calcium oxalate birefringence crystals deposition, dilation of renal tubules and tubular epithelial degeneration, which were attenuate by NAC therapy.
2:::In a prospective randomized study, 100 perimenopausal patients, without desire of pregnancy and with no response to pharmacological treatment, underwent endometrial ablation from 2012 to 2014. They were randomly divided in two groups: 50 patients treated with monopolar electrode resection loop (group A) and 50 patients treated with bipolar electrode resection loop (group B). Operative parameters were immediately assessed. Menstrual outcome parameters and psycho-physical well-being parameters were evaluated after 12 months.
3:::Six patients died before the 3-month HRQoL reassessments. We observed no significant longitudinal changes in mean EuroQol-5D index scores for patients (0.70 before vs 0.710 after; P = .83) or caregivers (0.95 before vs 0.95 after; P = .32) following gastrostomy insertion. The semi-structured interviews revealed problems in managing gastrostomy tubes, social isolation, and psychological and emotional consequences that reduced HRQoL.
4:::Different AQP4 isoforms in CBA result in different detection effects, and in-house M23-CBA is the most sensitive method. Some AQP4 antibody-negative NMO may be subject to diagnostic uncertainty due to limitations of the assays.
2:::This study assessed the transcriptional drive of a schizophrenia-associated BRD1 risk variant in vitro. Accordingly, to examine the effects of reduced Brd1 expression, we generated a genetically modified Brd1(+/-) mouse and subjected it to behavioral, electrophysiological, molecular, and integrative genomic analyses with focus on schizophrenia-relevant parameters.
3:::From July 2013 to December 2015, 45 consecutive patients treated with regorafenib for mCRC were analysed. The median age was 63. Twenty patients were started at 160 mg, while the other 25 patients were started at a lower dose. The median progression-free survival was 15.6 weeks (95% CI 13.1 to 18.1 weeks) and the median overall survival was 30.4 weeks (95% CI 16.6 to 44.3 weeks). Among the 31 evaluable patients, only 1 patient (3.2%) achieved partial response and another 10 patients (32.3%) had stable disease. The commonest grade 3 non-haematological adverse event (AE) was hand-foot skin reaction (26.7%) and the commonest grade 3 or 4 haematological AE was anaemia (8.9%). Notably, patients who were started on a lower dose of regorafenib had significantly lower risk of grade 3 treatment-emergent AEs. Overall, 78.3% of the patients had dose reduction during the first and second cycles. Patients older than 65 years were more likely to experience cycle suspension and require dose reduction.
4:::Findings suggest that RNT and mood recovery processes play an important role in explaining anxiety and depression symptoms. Additional work is needed to examine their role in symptom development and maintenance over time.
2:::Patients enrolled in a prospective, multicenter, idiopathic scoliosis surgical registry from 1995 to 2009 were reviewed. Any spine reoperation was defined as a ""terminal event."" An actuarial survivorship analysis that adjusts for patients lost to follow-up was performed to determine cumulative survival. Time intervals were defined as 0 to <3 months, 3 months to <1 year, 1 to <2 years, 2 to <5 years, and 5 to 10 years. Registry data and radiographs were reviewed and five categories for reoperation assigned: 1) implant failure and/or pseudarthrosis, 2) implant misplacement and/or prominence, 3) wound complication and/or infection, 4) residual deformity and/or progression, and 5) other.
3:::Of the 22 CareTrack conditions, LBP had the highest number of eligible healthcare encounters (6588 of 35,573, 19%), 125 to 884 per indicator among 164 LBP patients. Overall compliance with LBP indicators was 72% (range 42%-98%). Allied health practitioners and hospitals were the most compliant (82%-83% respectively), followed by general practitioners (54%). Some aspects of care were poor, such as documenting a thorough neurological examination, screening for serious diseases such as infection and inappropriate use of drugs such as steroids and treatments such as traction.
3:::Gravity reduced umbilical and cerebral flows when lambs were placed below the midline, but the reduction in UaBF and UvBF was similar. Ventilation during delayed UCC reduced UvBF and UaBF by similar amounts, irrespective of the lambs position, such that flows into and out of the placenta remained balanced. The effects of ventilation on umbilical flows were much greater than the effects of gravity, but no net placental to lamb blood transfusion could be detected under any condition. Cardiovascular parameters, cerebral oxygen kinetics and final blood volumes were similar in both groups 5 min after UCC.'
2:::All 108 patients who underwent prone esophagectomy at Tohoku University Hospital between July 2012 and March 2015 were included in this study. We divided patients into two groups: a control group (No-Monitoring group, surgery without IONM; n = 54) and a study group (Monitoring group, surgery with IONM; n = 54). In Monitoring group, neural stimulation was performed for both RLNs before and after dissection in the thoracic procedure, then for RLNs and vagus nerves (VNs) in the cervical procedure. The feasibility of IONM in Monitoring group and early surgical outcomes were retrospectively compared with those in No-Monitoring group.
4:::IL-1, TNF-α, and estrogen stimulate release of Hsp90 and augment activation of the prekallikrein-HK complex to generate kallikrein and bradykinin. IL-1 and TNF-α stimulate release of urokinase, which can convert plasminogen to plasmin and represents a possible source for plasmin generation in all types of hereditary angioedema, but particularly hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor with a factor XII mutation. Both kallikrein and plasmin activate factor XII; kallikrein is 20 times more potent on a molar basis.
3:::A total of 42,353 individuals were admitted to hospital for self-harm. In 41% of admissions, the patient had contact with a community mental health service after discharge. Patients connected with community mental health services had 5.33 (95% confidence interval = [5.09, 5.59]) times higher odds of follow-up care than unconnected patients. Other factors, such as increasing age and treatment as a psychiatric inpatient, were associated with lower odds of follow-up community care.
2:::Participants were recruited for this study through the use of snowball sampling. A series of semi-structured interviews were conducted with the participants via telephone. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and entered into a qualitative analysis software program to summarize the data.
3:::A one-compartment model including an extensive first-pass effect adequately described the data of morphine and its metabolites. Estimated mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) ratios following oral versus subcutaneous administration were: M3G/morphine 29.7:1 vs. 11.1:1; M6G/morphine 5.26:1 vs. 1.95:1; and M3G/M6G 5.65:1 vs. 5.70:1. Renal function was significantly correlated with clearance of the metabolites, which increased 0.602 L/h per every 10 mL/min/1.73 m(2) increase of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), reaching a plateau for eGFR >90 mL/min/1.73 m(2). The clearance of morphine or its metabolites was not found to be correlated with treatment failure.
4:::Our data suggest that establishing a robotic colorectal cancer surgery program requires approximately 75 cases. Once a program is well established, the learning curve is shorter and surgeons require fewer cases (25-30) to reach proficiency. These data suggest that the institutional learning curve extends beyond a single surgeons learning experience.'
1:::Tryptophan metabolism via indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated kynurenine pathway plays a role in immunomodulation and has been emerging as a plausible target for cancer immunotherapy. Imaging IDO-mediated kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism with positron emission tomography (PET) could provide valuable information for noninvasive assessment of cancer immunotherapy response. In this work, radiotracer 1-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-L-tryptophan (1-L-[(18)F]FETrp) and its enantioisomer 1-D-[(18)F]FETrp were synthesized and evaluated for PET imaging of IDO-mediated kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism.
2:::Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on basiliximab or daclizumab were identified by searching multiple databases and reference lists published up to July, 2015. Endpoints included acute rejection events and mortality rates. Risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated and pooled for a meta-analysis.
3:::Patients treated with IL2RA-based therapy were less likely to suffer acute rejection compared to control group (steroid or steroid-free). Patients in all groups had similar mortality rate. In the subgroup analysis, basiliximab and daclizumab-based therapies did not reduced acute rejection rate. No significant difference was found in mortality rate between both types of IL-2RA treatment groups and control groups. In the subgroup analysis regarding experimental design, no significant difference in the acute rejection and mortality rates were found between ""steroid plus IL2RA versus steroid"" and ""IL2RA versus steroid"" groups.
4:::Minimally invasive, quick, reversible endoscopic arytenoid abduction lateropexy might be a more favorable solution for neonatal bilateral vocal cord paralysis than earlier treatment strategies. In one step, the airway can be maintained without the risk of any permanent damage to voice production. Good swallowing function is also preserved. The specially modified endolaryngeal thread guide instrument gives a fast and effective option for creating the lateralized arytenoid position even in the technically challenging surgical context of a neonate larynx.
3:::Median age at time of tracheostomy was 0.8 years (interquartile range, 0.3-5.2 years).The highest mortality rate (27.8%) was observed in patients in the 13- to 18-year-old age category; their mortality rate was significantly higher when compared to the lowest mortality risk group patients (age 1-4 years, P = .031). Timing of death was evenly distributed: <90 days (37.6%), 90 days to 1 year (27.1%), and >1 year after tracheostomy (35.3%). Patients who underwent tracheostomy for cardiopulmonary disease had an increased risk of mortality compared with airway obstruction (adjusted hazard ratio: 3.53, 95% confidence interval: 1.72-7.24, P < .001) and other indications. Adjusted hazard ratios for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and congenital heart disease (CHD) were 2.63 and a 2.61, respectively (P < .001).
2:::Cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples were obtained from 54 ALS patients and 46 non-inflammatory neurological disease control (non-INDC) patients. CSF and serum FHC, FLC, and transferring levels were measured via the enzyme-linked immunosorbent method using a commercial ELISA kit, and the times from onset (durations), ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-r) scores, and disease progression rates (DPRs) were analyzed by registered neurologists. Statistical analysis was performed via Prism software.
3:::A total of 489 patients met our inclusion criteria and were included in our analysis. Average age at diagnosis was 70.4 years. The majority of the population was male (61.8%) and Caucasian (92.2%). Tumor characteristics included 23.7% cT1, 41.1% cT2 and 15.3% cT3 or above. Median overall survival was 18.4 months (95% CI 13.3-23.6). On multivariate Cox proportional analysis, radical cystectomy alone or with multimodal therapy (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death as compared to bladder preservation surgery alone. Survival in the radical cystectomy group did not differ between radical cystectomy alone and those receiving either neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.
4:::After adjusting for confounders, there were over twofold increased odds of WC with staple closure. Vertical incisions, failed labor and diabetes also contributed to WC. Suture closure appears to decrease the risks of WC post CD.
2:::We placed an endoscopic clip with an IC tag through a forceps aperture in the gastrointestinal tract, by using a porcine surgery model. After the endoscopic procedure, we performed laparoscopic surgery and approached the receiving antenna in the abdominal cavity to detect the IC tag through the porcine intestine. In an ex vivo examination with human colon tissues, the clip with the IC tag was placed on the mucosal surface to determine its ability to be detected. The receiving antenna near the serosal side of the human colon segment accurately detected the clip with the IC tag.
3:::It was found that a sufficiently large proportion of these patients (21 patients, 6.4%) were carriers of heterozygous deletions or duplications in PARK2. Analysis of PARK2 exon rearrangement carriers for the presence of point mutations in PARK2 did not reveal any variants with pathogenic significance.
3:::Neither implant loss nor crown fractures occurred. After a mean clinical service time of 36.9 months, fractures of the veneering porcelain were registered in 1.8 % of the cases. The Kaplan-Meier survival probability regarding eventless restorations was 98.2 %. Chipping of the veneering porcelain was registered in two cemented crowns without statistical influence of the type of retention. The indices showed healthy soft periimplant tissues in both groups.
2:::A qualitative, interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) study based on 1:1 semistructured interviews with EM consultants working full time in EDs across South West England. Eighteen EM consultants were interviewed across five EDs, the mean (SD) age of participants being 43.17 (5.8) years. The personal meanings that participants attached to their experiences were inductively analysed.
4:::Prevalence of DM was in line with findings of other RAAB+DRM surveys and slightly lower than the unpublished earlier age-matched Hungarian estimate. Prevalence of DR was slightly lower than expected. The prevalence of STDR was low in people aged 50 years and older in Hungary compared with the results of other RAAB with DRM surveys. DR screening coverage was low. To prevent severe complications of DM and possible concomitant visual loss, the coverage of ophthalmic examinations in patients with DM should be increased.
3:::The meta-analysis included seven RCTs. The results indicated that patients who received ICT for neck pain had significantly lower pain scores than those receiving placebos did immediately after treatment (standardized mean difference = -0.26, 95% confidence interval = -0.46 to -0.07). The pain scores during the follow-up period and the neck disability index scores immediately after treatment and during the follow-up period did not differ significantly.
2:::All neurology departments in Austria were addressed to report adult patients who were on immunosuppressive treatment for a diagnosis of Susacs syndrome between 1 August 2010 and 1 August 2015. Clinical course, treatment regimens, period and point prevalence rates, and annual incidence of Susac's syndrome in Austria in people over 19 years of age are reported.'
3:::A total of 312 ESPRIT patients were included in the study (151 in the arm receiving subcutaneous recombinant IL-2 and 161 in the control arm). Most of the patients were white (89%) and male (76%), and they had a median of 5 HCV RNA measurements per person [interquartile range (IQR) 3-6; range 1-9]. Median follow-up was 5 years (IQR: 2-6 years). At baseline, 96% of patients were taking cART and 93% had undetectable HIV RNA. Mean HCV RNA levels decreased by 13% per year over the study period [95% confidence interval (CI) 8-18%; P < 0.0001]. Baseline HCV RNA levels and the change over time in HCV RNA did not differ by randomization arm (P = 0.16 and P = 0.56, respectively). Nine individuals spontaneously cleared HCV RNA during follow-up [IL-28B genotypes: CC, five patients (56%); CT, four patients (44%)].
1:::To evaluate the dynamic characteristics of T2* -weighted signal change in exercising skeletal muscle of healthy subjects and peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients under a low-intensity exercise paradigm.
3:::Compared to baseline, ADC and D at 1 hour posttreatment (P = 0.005 and P = 0.013, respectively) and MD and DDC at 3 hours posttreatment (P = 0.009 and P = 0.005, respectively) significantly decreased and remained lower through 12 hours of follow-up (P = 0.005-0.022), followed by recovery to baseline levels at 24 hours posttreatment (P = 0.139-0.646). MK significantly increased at 1 hour posttreatment (P = 0.013) and remained higher through 24 hours of follow-up (P = 0.009-0.028). No significant differences were found in D*, f, and α at different timepoints (P = 0.188-0.714). Light microscopy did not reveal abnormal findings until 3 hours posttreatment, when central patchy necrosis was observed; more prominent diffuse necrosis was observed at 24 hours. Electron microscopy revealed swollen mitochondria at 1 hour posttreatment and accumulation of intracellular autophagosomes from 3 to 24 hours posttreatment.
4:::Siewert type II adenocarcinoma encompasses two types of cancers with different etiologies: GCA and BEA. Although there are no significant differences in lifestyle-related background factors between GCA and BEA, BEA is a risk factor for noncurative resection via ESD.
2:::The global IUBT success rate was expressed as the number of women with severe PPH who were successfully treated by IUBT divided by the total number treated by IUBT. IUBT failure was defined as the need for arterial embolisation or surgery. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate factors predicting IUBT failure.
3:::Patient populations before and after protocol initiation were similar in age, comorbidities, outpatient use of antiplatelet/anticoagulant medications, admission vital signs, and admission laboratory values. The median interval between admission and the first procedure was significantly shorter in the protocol group (40 vs 47 hours, p = 0.046). The proportion of patients who received packed red blood cell transfusions decreased following protocol initiation (41% vs 50%, p = 0.018). Median hospital length of stay was significantly shorter in the protocol group (5.0 vs 6.0 days, p = 0.014). Readmissions with GIB were decreased after protocol implementation (8% vs. 15%, p = 0.023).
2:::A retrospective analysis of 219 renal transplant recipients (both live and deceased donor) was done.
3:::L. infantum strains, and all positive lymph node and bone marrow samples for parasitological test gave positive results for cPCR and qPCR, presenting analytical sensitivity of ∼10(0) parasite mL(-1). For the blood samples, 40/69 (58%; CI 95%; 46%-69%) resulted positive for L. infantum in both tests. All positive samples were confirmed by sequencing.
4:::While the risks of serious maternal complications in relation to severe pre-eclampsia was similar across hospital delivery volume categories, deaths showed lower rates in large delivery volume hospitals than in smaller volume hospitals. The risk of complications was increased in hospitals with low compared with high severe pre-eclampsia rates.
3:::We show that previously reported associations for traits of threat sensitivity and weak inhibitory control with suicidal behavior are mediated by more specific suicide-promoting processes-namely, thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and capability for suicide.
2:::The medical charts of 421 consecutive eyes (361 patients) receiving one or more Ozurdex implant between October 2010 and February 2015 were reviewed retrospectively. Ocular hypertension was defined as intraocular pressure of at least 25 mmHg or an increase of at least 10 mmHg from baseline. The main indications for treatment were retinal vein occlusion (34%), diabetic macular edema (30%), postsurgical macular edema (17%), uveitis (14%), and other etiologies (5%).
3:::The mean patient age was 60.4 ± 8.5 years. Nineteen males and six females were included in this study. The mean body mass index was 25.3 ± 2.3 kg/m(2). There were 22 stage-I, 2 stage-II, and 1 stage-III gastric cancer patients. The mean operation time was 240.5 ± 44.6 min, and the time for anastomosis was 38.8 ± 11.2 min. The procedures were successfully performed in all cases without any intra-operative complications. There was one case of EJ leakage that occurred at the corner of EJ staple line and not at the enterotomy closure site.
1:::The aim of this article is to describe how fatigue affects the lives of people with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), how they experience fatigue, and how they deal with it in order to attune rehabilitation care to patients needs.'
2:::After literature search, we selected 14 studies of antenatal diagnosis of PS. Prenatal ultrasound findings, outcome, maternal and obstetrical data and genetic tests were recorded and analyzed.
4:::We provide a literature review of prenatal diagnosis of PS to identify ultrasound features that may be supportive in the diagnosis of this rare disease, helping in making a differential diagnosis with the other possible craniosynostosis syndromes and in suggesting gene molecular testing.
3:::Male patients had a higher age at onset (48.7 vs 41 years, p = 0.037) and less optic neuritis as the onset attack (17% vs 44%, p = 0.026), higher tendency to manifest as isolated myelitis over the follow-up period (67% vs 28%, p = 0.005), fewer optic neuritis attacks per year (0.08 vs 0.27, p < 0.001), and shorter relative P100 latency on VEP testing (97.1% vs 108.3%, p = 0.001). Moreover, male gender was significantly associated with the absence of optic neuritis attacks over the follow-up period independent of their age of onset.
2:::A total of 36 CHD cyanotic patients (17 males) (42.3±16.3 years) and 35 healthy individuals (16 males) (39.6±10.4 years) were enrolled. Assessed parameters were intima media thickness and flow-mediated dilatation (FMD). Assessed parameters using applanation tonometry methods were aortic systolic pressure, aortic pulse pressure (AoPP), augmentation pressure (AP), augmentation index (AI), pulse pressure amplification (PPampl), and pulse wave velocity (PWV).
3:::At follow-up (median 3.1 ± 2.4 years), after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, left ventricular ejection fraction, history of coronary artery disease, AFG had a significantly longer hospital stay versus NGR (21 ± 8 versus 20 ± 8 days; P = 0.019) and higher risk of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P = 0.041), pleural/pericardial effusions (P < 0.001), skin complications (P = 0.033), other events (P = 0.001), and blood tests (urea: P = 0.007; white blood cells: P = 0.002; neutrophils: P < 0.001; creatinine: P = 0.022). All-cause mortality was significantly higher in diabetes mellitus versus NGR (odds ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.17-2.21); a nonsignificant trend was observed in AFG versus NGR (odds ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval 0.77-1.98).
2:::Portal branch ligation (PBL) in rodents is equivalent to PVE in humans. We performed left-sided PBL in Sprague-Dawley rodents with the experimental group receiving perioperative HGF infusions. Baseline and postoperative liver volumetrics were obtained with CT scanning methods as performed in clinical practice. Baseline and postoperative liver functions were assessed via indocyanine green (ICG) elimination testing.
4:::Emotional, cognitive, and behavioral characteristics were represented as expected, based on the proposed conceptual model of behavior. This conceptual model provides the basis for evaluating behavioral changes after moderate-to-severe TBI and identifying modifiable targets and relevant subpopulations for behavioral intervention, with the goal of improved evidence-based personalized medicine for this population.
3:::Five classes emerged: low levels of symptomatology (52% of sample); anxiety and mild depressive symptoms (17%); parent-reported irritability and ADHD (16%); irritability and mixed comorbid symptoms (10%); and high levels of irritability, anxiety, depression, and ADHD (5%). Importantly, these latent classes cut across informants and the clinical conditions for which youth were initially evaluated. Further, the classes characterized by irritability exhibited the poorest overall functioning.
2:::Patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy were recruited for 3-T carotid CMR before surgery. Lipid area was derived from segmented T2 maps and compared directly to plaque lipid defined by histology.
3:::The BMK configuration did not show flow disturbances at the inflow section, and WSS values were similar to the control. An area of persistent low flow was observed throughout the cardiac cycle in the area between the anatomic bifurcation and neobifurcation. The CK model showed recirculation zones near the inflow area of the stents with a resulting low average WSS value and high OSI. The proximal inflow of the CERAB configuration did not show flow disturbances, and WSS values were comparable to control. Near the inflow of the limbs, a minor zone of recirculation was observed without changes in WSS values. Flow, WSS, and OSI on the lateral wall of the proximal iliac artery were undisturbed in all models.
4:::Introduction of sFlt-1/PlGF into hospital practice is cost-saving. Savings are generated primarily through improvement in diagnostic accuracy and reduction in unnecessary hospitalization for women before PEs onset.'
3:::None of the CRAs showed MMR deficiency (0.0 % vs. 5.6 %, CRA vs. CDA, p = 0.036), HER2 overexpression (0.0 % vs. 12.5 %, p = 0.001), or loss of PTEN expression (0.0 % vs. 9.7 %, p = 0.003). Moreover, MET overexpression (4.4 % vs. 19.4 %, p = 0.004), and a mutant p53 pattern (12.4 % vs. 62.5 %, p < 0.001) were significantly less common in CRAs than in CDAs. However, clinicopathological features and all the profile of the molecules of CRAs were close to those of the PCA group.
2:::Twenty-five participants with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HF-rEF) from a tertiary referral centre in England were recruited. Each participant took part in a semi-structured interview exploring the effect of breathlessness had on their lives. Data was analysed through Braun and Clarkes framework for thematic analysis.'
3:::We included 263 patients (87 naïve and 176 previously exposed to anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha, TNF). After 12 weeks, clinical response, clinical remission, and endoscopic remission rates were 51, 26, and 14 %, respectively. The naïve group demonstrated better response to treatment than the anti-TNF-exposed group at short-term. Clinical and endoscopic remission within 1 year of treatment was better in the naïve group (65 vs. 49 and 50 vs. 35 %, respectively). The rates of AE, dose-escalation, hospitalisations, and colectomy during the first year were higher in anti-TNF-exposed patients (40, 43, and 27 % vs. 26, 21, and 11 %, respectively). Patients with primary failure and intolerance to the first anti-TNF and severe disease were associated with worse clinical response. Primary non-response to prior anti-TNF treatment and severe disease were predictive of poorer clinical remission. Low levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and faecal calprotectin (FC) at baseline were predictors of clinical remission.
4:::This is the first network meta-analysis to compare all second-line regimens reported in phase III gastric cancer trials. The results suggest the paclitaxel plus ramucirumab combination is the most effective therapy and should be the reference regimen for future comparative trials.
2:::We conducted a multi-institutional RCT. Eligibility criteria included histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma in the middle or lower third of the stomach, clinical stage I tumor. Patients were preoperatively randomized to ODG or LADG. This study is now in the follow-up stage. The primary endpoint is relapse-free survival (RFS) and the primary analysis is planned in 2018. Here, we compared the surgical outcomes of the two groups. This trial was registered at the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry as UMIN000003319.
3:::There was 43% more of the BDNF V-VIII-IX transcript in schizophrenia samples. BDNF mRNA expression and DNA methylation of seven CpG sites were not associated with schizophrenia after accounting for age and PMI effects. BDNF mRNA expression and DNA methylation were not altered by Val66Met after accounting for age and PMI effects. DNA methylation of one CpG site had a marginally significant positive correlation with mRNA expression in schizophrenia subjects.
1:::Clinical pharmacist (CP) interventions from the PROTECTED-UK cohort, a multi-site critical care interventions study, were further analysed to assess effects of: time on critical care, number of interventions, CP expertise and days of week, on impact of intervention and ultimately contribution to patient care.
4:::A CP is essential for safe and optimised patient medication therapy; an extended and developed pharmacy service is expected to reduce errors. CP services should be adequately staffed to enable adequate time for prescription review and maximal therapy optimisation.
2:::The LDA group was defined as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) <3, including only 1 clinical manifestation of rash, alopecia, mucosal ulcers, pleurisy, pericarditis, fever, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia. The patients could be taking antimalarials. Remission was defined as no clinical manifestation from taking antimalarials alone, and the HDA group was defined as SLEDAI-2K >6. The time frame for inclusion in each group was at least 1 year.
3:::In the matched data set consisting of 234 (of 600) hands treated with a blind injection and 87 (of 89) ultrasound-guided injection cases, ultrasound guidance was associated with a reduced hazard of retreatment (hazard ratio 0.59 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.37-0.93]). In addition, ultrasound guidance was associated with 55% reduced odds of retreatment within 1 year compared to blind injections (adjusted odds ratio 0.45 [95% CI 0.24-0.83]).
2:::An anonymous OR observer selected cases at random and evaluated the compliance rate before the rollout of the electronic SSC. In June 2014, an electronic audit was performed to assess the compliance rate. Random OR observations were also performed throughout the summer in 2014. Perioperative risk events, such as consent issues, incorrect counts, wrong site, and wrong procedure were compared before and after the electronic SSC rollout. A perception survey was also administered to NorthShore OR personnel.
3:::Human amniotic epithelium was found to express gal-1, gal-3, gal-7 and gal-8 mRNA. Gal-3 mRNA and protein is increased in fetal membranes and in the amniotic epithelium in patients with chorionamnionitis.
3:::NMO patients exhibited significantly elevated MMP-2, TIMP-1, interleukin-6, and MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio in CSF (but not sera) than the other groups. The CSF/serum albumin ratio, an index of BBB permeability, was most strongly correlated with CSF MMP-2 concentration, which in turn correlated with CSF interleukin-6 levels. Immunohistochemistry revealed MMP-2- and TIMP-1-positive cells surrounding vessels in NMO lesions.
4:::Nocturia appears to impose a substantial socioeconomic burden in all three countries. Clinical and economic benefits could accrue from an increased awareness of the impact that nocturia imposes on patients, health services, and society as a whole.
3:::The results showed that the expected consequences of having a disability and therefore the descriptive norms associated with disability were less negative for the participants who were familiar with disability, but higher for sports students. Furthermore, the relation between objective and subjective consequences (having a disability and feeling disabled, respectively) and public and private use of ATD were modelled. The model shows that both higher objective and lower subjective consequences were linked to higher ATD use in public and, indirectly, in private.
2:::A literature search in 3 electronic databases (Web of Science, Science Direct and PubMed) was used to extract publications from 2000 to 2015 that related pharmacist to TM/CM products. Out of the 2859 publications extracted for abstract review, 171 documents were selected for full text assessment. 41 publications which reported findings from exploratory studies or discussed pharmacists responsibilities towards TM/CM products were selected for inclusion in this study.'
1:::The objective of this study was to validate the choice of simulated activities in a group of newly trained PW users.
3:::Of 8360 patients, ipsilateral hemiparesis was detected in 14 patients (0.17%, mean age 71±6 years, eight men). Lesions responsible for the recent strokes were located in the frontal cortex in three patients, corona radiata in seven, internal capsule in one, and pons in three. These lesions were located along the typical route of the corticospinal tract in all but one patient. Thirteen patients also had a past history of stroke contralateral to the recent lesions; 12 of these had motor deficits contralateral to past stroke lesions. During TMS, ipsilateral magnetic evoked potentials were evoked in two of seven patients and contralateral potentials were evoked in all seven. Functional MRI activated cerebral hemispheres ipsilaterally in eight of nine patients and contralaterally in all nine.
2:::The present study utilised data collected from 1608 respondents aged 15 years as part of the England WHO Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Study. Multilevel modelling was undertaken using the package MLwiN (version 2.33) to investigate the potential domains and dimensions of family life, school culture and environment, and neighbourhood factors that may operate as protective health assets.
3:::Dexamethasone increased the diastolic BP and MDA/GPX ratio in comparison with control group (128 ± 7 vs. 105 ± 3 mmHg, p < 0.05 and 0.2 ± 0.046 vs. 0.08 ± 0.02, p < 0.05). Combination of dexamethasone and walnut (200 mg/kg) prevented the dexamethasone-induced diastolic hypertension (109 ± 3 vs. 128 ± 7 mmHg; p < 0.05), increased the GPX level (14.8 ± 1.46 vs. 5.1 ± 0.64 unit/mg, p < 0.05), reduced the MDA/GPX ratio (0.16 ± 0.015 vs. 0.2 ± 0.046) and improved serum NO level.
4:::The presence of either microbial-associated or sterile IAI was associated with increased amniotic fluid cathepsin-G concentrations in pregnancies complicated by PPROM. Amniotic fluid cathepsin-G appears to be a potential marker of IAI.
3:::Synthesis of findings was challenging given the exploratory phase of most research activity with diverse populations described and extensive differences in research methodologies. There is currently weak, but potentially positive evidence to support using carbonation as a compensatory technique in dysphagia rehabilitation.
2:::TCI was performed in BALB/c mice in back skin or auricle skin using PC-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) plus cholera toxin (CT). Inoculations were given once each week for six consecutive weeks. Immunogenicity was evaluated by measuring PC-specific IgG and specific IgG1, IgG2a, IgM, IgA, and secretory IgA antibodies by ELISA. IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and IFN-γ levels were also measured by ELISA.
3:::Individual changes in pain self-efficacy were not associated with changes in observed activity: AMPS motor (rs = 0.08, p = 0.27) and process (rs = 0.12, p = 0.11), not even in those patients with a clinically relevant improvement in observed functioning (38.5%), and only weakly or moderatly with changes in SF-36-PF; (rs = 0.31, p < 0.0001), SF-36-MSC; (rs = 0.41, p < 0.0001), and pain catastrophizing (rs = -0.31, p < 0.0001). No differences in pain self-efficacy were observed between the rehabilitated group and controls (difference: 1.61; 95% CI: -0.84 to 4.06; p = 0.24). However, a subgroup (34%) had a clinically relevant improvement in pain self-efficacy. This group was younger (mean age 41.4 vs. 45.8, p = 0.01), more recently diagnosed (1.8 vs. 2.8 years, p = 0.003), but had an unresolved welfare situation (59% vs. 40%, p = 0.02).
4:::The prevalence of depression varied across the different groups of PLWHIV, with levels much higher than in the general population. Moreover, there was a strong association with socioeconomic status and HIV experience.
3:::From 1984 to 2014, 21 pregnancies occurred in 15 patients (short bowel syndrome (n = 11), motility disorders (n = 3), mucosal disease (n = 1)) of whom 14 occurred after 2010. Median follow-up was 12 years. Median HPN duration before pregnancy was 8 years. HPN was adapted monthly during pregnancy, with close monitoring and supplementations. Energy intake was regularly increased and median maternal weight gain was 10 kg. Median age at the first pregnancy was 27 years. In 55% of cases, the newborn was preterm. Maternal complications occurred in 67% of cases (mainly due to underlying disease or HPN complications). There were 3 post-partum hemorrhages and 6 hypotrophic newborns. Eighteen infants were healthy and 2 chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) were suspected.
2:::Low-risk (representing normal placentation) women from 11 0/7 to 13 6/7 weeks gestation were prospectively enrolled. Selective measurement of serum free sFlt-1 using a new automated assay from 100 eligible subjects was analyzed with gestational age, maternal weight, fetal crown-rump length (CRL), and mean uterine artery Doppler pulsatility index (PI). Placental volume (surrogate for trophoblastic mass) was estimated using 3-dimensional ultrasound and was assessed for its association with serum free sFlt-1.'
3:::In bivariate analyses, utilization-DP was associated with both insurance and urgency. In multivariate analyses, the difference in percent utilizing care for an urgent versus non-urgent DP among children covered by Medicaid/SCHIP was 32 percentage points; PHD, 25 percentage points; PHND, 12 percentage points; and no insurance, 14 percentage points. The difference in utilization by DP urgency was higher for children with Medicaid/SCHIP compared with either PHND or uninsured children.
3:::The MRI LV and PI-RADS score were associated both with prostate cancer detection (both P < 0.001) and with significant prostate cancer detection (P < 0.001 and P = 0.008, respectively). When the two variables were matched, increasing LV increased the risk within each PI-RADS group. Prostate cancer detection was 1.4-times higher for LVs of 0.5-1 mL and 1.8-times higher for LVs of ≥1 mL; significant prostate cancer detection was 2.6-times for LVs of 0.5-1 mL and 4-times for LVs of ≥1 mL. There was a positive correlation between MRI LV and HTV (r = 0.9876, P < 0.001). Finally, Bland-Altman analysis showed that MRI LV was underestimated by 4.2% compared to HTV. Study limitations include its monocentric and retrospective design and the limited cohort.
2:::Between June 2009 and December 2015, we assessed 263 consecutive patients who underwent LDG in our institution. In all patients, the reconstruction procedures were performed extracorporeally with the hand-sewn technique. The clinical characteristics, surgical outcomes, and operation cost related to anastomosis were evaluated and compared with the other methods.
4:::This study provides the first evidence that exposure to e-cigarette adverts might influence childrens perceptions of smoking tobacco cigarettes, reducing their perceived harm of occasional smoking. These results suggest the potential for e-cigarette adverts to undermine tobacco control efforts by reducing a potential barrier (ie, beliefs about harm) to occasional smoking.'
3:::Unweighted UniFrac distances were associated with intakes of potassium and antioxidant vitamins C, E and beta-carotene equivalents, whereas weighted UniFrac distances were associated with antioxidant vitamins riboflavin, niacin equivalents, beta-carotene equivalents and vitamin A equivalents. Intakes of beta-carotene equivalents, vitamin C, vitamin E, niacin equivalents and riboflavin correlated negatively with Bacteroides and/or its corresponding higher level taxa. Intakes of beta-carotene equivalents and vitamin E also positively correlated with Firmicutes and specific taxa belonging to Firmicutes.
2:::This was a prospective cohort study that evaluated patients admitted in intensive care units with diagnosis of acute kidney injury AKIN-3, mechanically ventilated, and submitted to conventional hemodialysis (CHD), extended hemodialysis (EHD) or high volume peritoneal dialysis (HVPD). Indirect calorimetry was performed at pre dialysis time and during the dialysis procedure. Parameters that could change REE were also evaluated.
3:::Fifty-four patients (21 males; mean age: 48.0 [95%CI 46.6; 49.3] years; mean preoperative BMI: 40.4 [95%CI 39.4; 41.4] kg/m(2)) were included. One month post-RYGB, usual dietary intake of the studied micronutrients was significantly decreased compared to pre-RYGB, but gradually increased until 12 months post-RYGB, remaining below baseline values. By including micronutrient supplement intake, 12 months post-RYGB values were higher than baseline, except for zinc. Hemoglobin, ferritin, vitamin B12 and C-reactive protein serum concentrations were significantly decreased and transferrin saturation and mean corpuscular volume were significantly increased 12 months post-RYGB. Serum hepcidin concentration was significantly decreased 6 months post-RYGB.
4:::- Logical evaluation and management pathways for a patient with a solitary pulmonary nodule will allow providers to diagnose and treat individuals with early stage lung cancer and minimize morbidity from invasive procedures for patients with benign lesions.
3:::BOAST kfCK values were 0.281 ± 0.002 s(-1) in the calf and 0.35 ± 0.05 s(-1) in myocardium. These are consistent with literature values from lower fields. Using a literature values for adenosine triphosphate concentration, we computed CK flux values of 4.55 ± 1.52 mmol kg(-1) s(-1) . The sensitive volume for BOAST depends on the B1 inhomogeneity of the transmit coil.
2:::We investigated 96 infants with hypotension and critical neonatal disease for cortisol metabolism and are divided into responders and non-responders to plasma expanders and inotropes. Serum concentrations of steroids were analysed soon after the onset of volume expansion and inotrope treatment for shock. The 48 non-responders were treated with intravenous hydrocortisone (HC) and serum cortisol concentrations were monitored a week later.
3:::Relaparotomy was performed in 96 horses at <8 weeks following initial surgery at a median of 4 days. This represented 6.3% of horses that underwent laparotomy during the study period (n = 1531). Relaparotomy was most frequently undertaken based on signs of persistent post-operative colic (76%; n = 73). Short-term survival for horses undergoing relaparotomy due to persistent colic was 53%, incisional dehiscence 50%, post-operative reflux 37%, haemoperitoneum 17% and septic peritonitis 0%. Median survival was 6 days for all horses undergoing relaparotomy and 778 days for those that recovered following anaesthesia. Nonsurvival was associated with increased packed cell volume at 24 h following initial laparotomy (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.10, P = 0.009), peritonitis as a reason for undertaking relaparotomy (HR 4.41, 95% CI 1.43-13.6, P = 0.01) and adhesions found at relaparotomy (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.03-3.04, P = 0.04). Increased likelihood of survival was associated with colic signs being the reason for performing relaparotomy (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26-0.88, P = 0.02) and small intestinal distension found at relaparotomy (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.96, P = 0.04).
2:::MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL and Google Scholar were searched systematically for ED studies using capnography during PSA. Data extraction was performed by two independent authors. Using MedCalc V.13.3.3 and Meta-DiSc V.1.4, data were aggregated under the random-effects model and heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrans Q-test and the I(2) statistic.'
4:::Although many of the diseases and clinical signs had been previously reported, this study also identified some previously unreported priorities such as rabies in donkeys, an unidentified musculoskeletal syndrome in horses and respiratory signs in both horses and donkeys. The information gathered during this participatory study with owners may be used to inform future veterinary and educational programme interventions, as well as identify future research priorities.
1:::Physiotherapists often prescribe self-management strategies for their patients. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in improving patient outcome is related to the rate of patient adherence. The aims of this study were to explore physiotherapists views on the importance and perceived rates of patient adherence to physiotherapist prescribed self-management strategies; the perceived importance of methods physiotherapists can employ to aid patient adherence and the barriers to employing these methods.'
3:::At 4 months, 11/14 participants reported continuing with the exercises. By 12 months, 7/13 participants still reported exercising. The ability to establish a routine determined whether participants adhered to the exercise programme. This was sometimes influenced by practical issues. We also identified facilitators and barriers to regular exercise in the themes of the following: the therapeutic encounter, perceived benefit of exercises, attitude of mind, confidence, and unpredictability.
2:::First, we review studies that have directly compared psychobiological features (neural, neuroendocrine, autonomic) across depression, anxiety, and their co-occurrence, defined either categorically or dimensionally. Second, we analyze adults diurnal cortisol secretion to examine the independent and interactive relations of continuously-assessed depressive and anxiety symptoms to neuroendocrine function.'
4:::Increased expression of PECAM-1, ICAM-3, and VCAM-1 in colonic biopsies from patients with IBD in clinical remission is associated with subsequent flares. This suggests that increases in the expression of these proteins may be early events that lead to flares in patients with IBD.
3:::Fifty-two patients were recruited (41 with overt and 11 with occult bleeding); 36 received a definitive diagnosis. The diagnostic yields and sensitivities of VCE and CTE were 59.6% and 30.8% (P=0.004), and 72.2% and 44.4% (P=0.052), respectively. The combined sensitivity of VCE and CTE (88.9%) was significantly greater than VCE (P=0.03) or CTE (P<0.01) alone. VCE was better for ulcers, enteritis, and angiodysplasia, whereas CTE was better for tumors and Meckel diverticula. Age below 40 years and severe bleeding were associated with a higher diagnostic yield for CTE [odds ratios (95% confidence interval)=7.3 (1.04-51.4), P=0.046 and 6.1 (1.4-25.5), P=0.014, respectively].
2:::An analysis was undertaken of 314 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism undergoing parathyroid surgery in a tertiary academic practice between January 2009 and April 2013. There were 187 patients with single-gland disease; 68 failed to meet inclusion criteria, resulting in a study population of 119 patients. Preoperative parathyroid hormone, calcium, ionized calcium, 25-OH-vitamin D, creatinine, and glomerular filtration rate values were determined, along with postoperative calcium, ionized calcium, and parathyroid hormone levels. Patients were divided into two groups based on their postoperative parathyroid hormone values: elevated parathyroid hormone and normal parathyroid hormone.
3:::In total, 3840 patients were included. Weekday was not significantly associated with 30-day mortality (P > 0.05), nor the total number of resected lymph nodes (P > 0.05), nor with R0 resection rates (P > 0.05). Also, weekday did not significantly influence overall survival using weekday as discrete variable [Monday-Friday, hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, P = 0.140), as 2 weekday categories (Wednesday-Friday vs Monday-Tuesday, HR 0.97, P = 0.434), or with separate weekday categories (Tuesday vs Monday, HR 0.99, P = 0.826; Wednesday vs Monday, HR 1.06, P = 0.430; Thursday vs Monday, HR 0.92, P = 0.206; Friday vs Monday, HR 0.91, P = 0.140).
4:::Occurrence of generic substitution was correlated with more time spent on communicating on non-medical, but not on medical, issues. No extra time was spent on medical information for the groups normally overrepresented among those with low health literacy. This study suggests that pharmacists need to further embrace their role in promoting rational use of medicines, not least when generic substitution occurs.
2:::Indices of niacin status, namely the erythrocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide:nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ratio (NAD:NADP ratio) and erythrocyte concentrations of NAD and NADP, were compared in blood collected from EGS and healthy control grazing horses. Blood concentrations of vitamins B1, B2 and B6 were also compared.
3:::The only cognitive bias to significantly predict delusions after controlling for the severity of auditory hallucinations was the jumping to conclusions (JTC) bias (predicted both emotional and cognitive dimensions). Only the emotional dimension of auditory hallucinations was predicted by the intentionalising and dichotomous thinking biases, after delusional severity was controlled for.
3:::Total volumetric flow and peak velocity measurements based on HOTSPA and the conventional PC-MRI were in good agreement with a bias of -0.005 mL (-0.1% relative bias error) for total volumetric flow and 1.21 cm/s (1.1% relative bias error) for peak velocity, although the total acquisition time was 50% of the conventional PC-MRI.
4:::Using a community-based approach to deliver hearing aids to children in a resource constrained environment is a cost-effective alternative to the traditional centre-based approach. Further evidence is needed to draw conclusions for scale-up of approaches; rigorous analysis is possible using well-prepared data collection tools and working closely with sector professionals. Implications for Rehabilitation Delivery models vary by resources needed for their implementation. Community-based deliver models of hearing aids to children in low-income countries are a cost-effective alternative. The assessment of costs and effects of hearing aids delivery models in low-income countries is possible through planned collaboration between researchers and sector professionals.
1:::To investigate two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) ultrashort echo time (UTE) and 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequences for the imaging of iron-oxide nanoparticles (IONP).
2:::The phantoms were composed of tubes filled with different IONP concentrations ranging from 2 to 45 mM. The tubes were fixed in an agarose gel phantom (0.9% by weight). Morphological imaging was performed with 3D MP-RAGE, 2D UTE, 2D adiabatic inversion recovery-prepared UTE (2D IR-UTE), 3D UTE with Cones trajectory (3D Cones), and 3D IR-Cones sequences. Quantitative assessment of IONP concentration was performed using R2*(1/T2*) and R1 (1/T1 ) measurements using a 3 Tesla (T) scanner.
3:::Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups. Serum zinc levels were considerably increased in the zinc group after supplementation. There was significant decline in concentrations of serum calprotectin, TNF-α and IL-6 (p < 0.05) in the zinc group. In the control group also, serum calprotectin and IL-6 levels were found to be decreased significantly after antibiotic treatment (p < 0.05), while TNF-α showed insignificant reduction. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess the survival time between the groups. The mortality was lower in the zinc group compared to the control group 5 versus 11, p= 0.12.
2:::  Pregnant mice were exposed to ATRA at embryonic day 10 (E10) and 13 (E13) by oral gavage. Skulls of mice embryos at E19.5 and adult mice at postnatal day 35 (P35) were collected for high-resolution microcomputed tomography (microCT) imaging scanning and section HE staining. Reconstruction and measurement of mouse skulls were performed for prenatal and postnatal analysis of the control and ATRA-exposed mice.
4:::The findings provide evidence that infant massage by mother has an effect on the state anxiety of mothers of preterm infants, so it is recommended that mothers apply massage for preterm infants to improve their mental health.
3:::Of the 672 patients included, 419 (62%) were polypathological, of which 89.3% met PIP criteria versus 79.4% of non-polypathological patients (p <0.01). 40.3% of polypathological patients met at least one Beers criteria, 62.8% at least one STOPP criteria, 62.3% at least one START criteria and 65.6% at least one ACOVE criteria. The rate of potentially inappropriate prescribing was higher in polypathological patients regardless of the tool used.
2:::This prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative study included 66 T2DM patients with HbA1c >7.5% even after receiving repeated education programs on CRD. They were randomly allocated to either the 130g/day LCD group (n = 33) or CRD group (n = 33). Patients received personal nutrition education of CRD or LCD for 30 min at baseline, 1, 2, 4, and 6 months. Patients of the CRD group were advised to maintain the intake of calories and balance of macronutrients (28× ideal body weight calories per day). Patients of the LCD group were advised to maintain the intake of 130 g/day carbohydrate without other specific restrictions. Several parameters were assessed at baseline and 6 months after each intervention. The primary endpoint was a change in HbA1c level from baseline to the end of the study.
3:::At baseline, BMI and HbA1c were 26.5 (24.6-30.1) and 8.3 (8.0-9.3), and 26.7 (25.0-30.0) kg/m(2) and 8.0 (7.6-8.9) %, in the CRD and LCD, respectively. At the end of the study, HbA1c decreased by -0.65 (-1.53 to -0.10) % in the LCD group, compared with 0.00 (-0.68 to 0.40) % in the CRD group (p < 0.01). Also, the decrease in BMI in the LCD group [-0.58 (-1.51 to -0.16) kg/m(2)] exceeded that observed in the CRD group (p = 0.03).
4:::We observed low enforcement of the regulation that bans tobacco retail sales near schools and high prevalence of tobacco displays that target children in Changsha, China. Chinese officials should act to effectively enforce the regulation bans of tobacco sales near schools. In addition, regulations are urgently needed to limit tobacco marketing practices at the point of sale, especially those targeting youth.
3:::The mean frequencies of micronucleus test parameters were significantly higher in exposed persons. Increase of micronucleus yield with duration of exposure (DOE) by 0.303MN/year was revealed.
1:::We establish a mechanical injury model for articular cartilage to assess the sensitivity of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in detecting cartilage damage early in time. Mechanical injury provides a more realistic model of cartilage degradation compared with commonly used enzymatic degradation.
2:::We prospectively followed 7216 participants (55-80 years old) at high cardiovascular risk from the PREDIMED (PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea) study for a mean of 5.8 years. All participants were initially free of CVD. Yearly repeated measurements of dietary information with a validated 137-item food-frequency questionnaire were used to assess egg consumption and other dietary exposures. The endpoint was the rate of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke or death from cardiovascular causes).
3:::Three themes emerged through the process of analysis: (1) Explaining goal-setting'; (2) 'Working with goals'; and (3) 'Influences on collaborative goal-setting'. Goal-setting practices among respiratory physiotherapists varied considerably. Collaborative goal-setting was described as challenging and was sometimes driven by service need rather than patient values. Lack of training in collaborative goal-setting at both undergraduate and postgraduate level was also seen as an issue.'
4:::Low expression of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein was associated with decreased overall survival in all patient-group with resected colon cancer. It is associated with decreased recurrence-free survival and overall survival in the subset of patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy and patients who were TNM stage II. Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein may provide important prognostic information in patients with colon cancer.
3:::Fifty-nine studies (25 733 participants) were included. Depressive symptoms were inversely correlated to exercise capacity (CC = -0.15; 95% CI, -0.17 to -0.12). Heterogeneity was significant (I = 64%; P < .001). There was no evidence of publication bias (Fail-safe N = 4681; Egger test: P = .06; Kendall test: P = .29).
2:::A questionnaire survey was conducted on all residents aged 65 years and older living in an urban district in Tokyo (N = 7682). From among this population, 3000 residents were randomly selected to receive visits from trained nurses and to have their health status checked and their cognitive function examined using the MMSE.
3:::In both studies, the memories of delusion-like experiences were less vivid, less emotionally intense than positive (but not negative) memories and emotionally neutral. Their centrality to the self did not differ from that of positive and negative memories. Moreover, the severity of delusions in study 1 and delusion-proneness in study 2 were significantly correlated with vividness, emotional intensity, and centrality of memories of delusion-like experiences.
4:::Water-fat separation is feasible in real-time MRI of moving knee and wrist at 3 T. PS-bSSFP offers movies with higher SNR and higher diagnostic quality when compared with Dixon scans. Magn Reson Med 78:58-68, 2017. © 2016 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.
1:::MR elastography (MRE) of the brain is being explored as a biomarker of neurodegenerative disease such as dementia. However, MRE measures for healthy brain have varied widely. Differing wave delivery methodologies may have influenced this, hence finite element-based simulations were performed to explore this possibility.
3:::Minors received cigarettes from 32.4% of purchase attempts, all delivered by the US Postal Service (USPS) from overseas sellers. None failed due to age/ID verification. All failures were due to payment processing problems. USPS left 63.6% of delivered orders at the door with the remainder handed to minors with no age verification. 70.6% of vendors advertised light cigarettes and 60.3% flavoured, with 23.5% and 11.8%, respectively, delivered to the teens. Study credit cards were exposed to an estimated $7000 of fraudulent charges.
2:::Ischemic stroke patients aged 18-55 years old with isolated symptomatic middle cerebral artery stenosis were evaluated and followed up prospectively for six months. Logistic regression was used to detect predictors of ipsilateral stroke recurrence, and factors associated with the dynamic changes of lesion vascular were analyzed.
3:::We generated three nutrient patterns by factor analysis. An animal-sourced pattern (animal protein, cobalamin, cholesterol and omega-6) was positively associated with CRP (p for trend across quartiles 0.057). A plant-sourced pattern (beta-carotene, vitamin A, lutein and zeaxanthin) was inversely associated with CRP (p for trend across quartiles 0.005). The association between plant-sourced pattern and CRP was stronger in participants with severe sleep apnoea, smoking (p for interaction 0.019), and participants without diabetes (p for interaction 0.238) and/or with normal triglycerides (p for interaction 0.005) and high density lipoprotein (p for interaction 0.120) compared with their counterparts. No interactions were found between the animal-sourced pattern and lifestyle factors and chronic conditions. No independent associations were found between the animal/plant-sourced pattern and IL-6. No associations were found between the vitamin B and folate pattern (total folate, thiamine, riboflavin and niacin) and inflammatory markers.
2:::Cross-sectional study with data from 65,955 people aged ≥50 years from 18 countries (SHARE project, 2011-2013). The outcome variable, hazardous drinking, was calculated using an adaptation of the AUDIT-C test. Several individual (sociodemographic, life-style and health factors) and contextual variables (country socioeconomic indicators and alcohol policies) were analysed. The prevalence of hazardous drinking was estimated by each exposure variable. To estimate associations, multilevel Poisson regression models with robust variance were fit, yielding prevalence ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI).
4:::In our experience, covering the PComA by FDS when treating carotid siphon aneurysms appeared safe and the P1/PComA ratio is a good predictor of flow changes in PComA.
3:::Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) grades 2b-3 using the first chosen technique did not differ significantly between the two techniques (FAST 64.0% vs stent retriever thrombectomy 81.2%, p=0.305). Time from groin puncture to reperfusion was significantly shorter for stent retriever thrombectomy (53.0 vs 38.5 min; p=0.045). Distal embolization occurred in three cases (12.0%) in the FAST group and in four (26.7%) in the stent retriever group (p=0.362). However, the two techniques did not differ significantly in the final TICI 2b-3 rate (72.0% vs 87.5%; p=0.441). A frequent angiographic finding regarding the failure of FAST was that the M2 occlusion was located immediately after severe acute angulation between M1 and M2.
1:::To describe the development of important information about me (IIAM), an application (app) used to communicate and organize healthcare information for people with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD).
2:::Participants were11 community-dwelling older adults (aged 63-88) who completed the Memory and Aging Program, an evidence-based multi-modal group intervention for normal age-related memory change. Semi-structured interviews were administered post-intervention. Responses were analyzed using qualitative content analysis until meaningful themes were agreed upon.
3:::The mean support duration was 280 ± 163 days. Mechanical unloading after HeartWare support resulted in reduced filling pressures (mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 27.1 ± 6.6 to 14.8 ± 5.1 mm Hg, p < 0.0001). Mean LV cardiomyocyte cell size decreased from 2,789.7 ± 671.8 to 2,290.8 ± 494.2 μm(2) (p = 0.02). LV and RV ejection fractions improved significantly (24% ± 8% to 35% ± 9% [p < 0.001] and 35% ± 11% to 40% ± 8% [p < 0.02], respectively). NT-proBNP levels fell 4.8-fold by Day 90 after support, consistent with a decrease in LV wall stress. Despite these concordant beneficial findings, the microRNA transcriptome did not change significantly across the group.
4:::Reverse remodelling is evident at multiple levels with chronic HeartWare support in the absence of changes in the microRNA transcriptome. Successful myocardial unloading is associated with a decrease in wall stress, regression of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and an improvement in LV and RV ejection fractions.
3:::In the intervention group, significant improvements were found: in functional ability - Harris Hip Score after two (mean difference = 4.7 points) and 12 (mean difference = 5.85 points) weeks; in muscle strength - handgrip for both hands (mean difference for dominant hand = 4.16 and for the other hand = 2.8) after 12 weeks; and in role-physical dimension SF-36 Health Survey (mean difference = 6.42 points) after 12 weeks.
2:::A total of 453 consecutive patients with clinically symptomatic low back pain or radiculopathy were recruited to undergo lumbar kinematic magnetic resonance imaging. The study participants consisted of 271 males (60%) and 182 females (40%). The average age was 44.5±12.2 years old. We investigated the following measurements at each level from L3-L4 to L5-S1: dural sac diameter, ligamentum flavum thickness, disk bulge, disk degeneration, angular motion, translational motion, and posterior disk height. The odds ratios (ORs) for ≥2 mm change of dural sac diameter between flexion and extension were calculated.
4:::The folk recreation program has the potential to improve cognitive function, ability of daily living and behavioral and psychological symptoms of the elders with dementia. The folk leisure activities, which embed in the participants cultural background, will motivate their positive feelings and memories, can delay the progression of disease and improve the symptoms.

3:::The WOG primary (apical curvature: 928.87 ± 293.69; coronal curvature 1102.32 ±397.39 NCF) had higher cyclic fatigue resistance than Reciproc R25 and WO primary in the apical and coronal curvatures (P < 0.05). The Reciproc R25 file (745.63 ± 253.49 NCF) had significantly greater cyclic fatigue resistance than the WO primary (583.89 ± 183.38 NCF) in the apical curvature (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the cyclic fatigue resistance of the Reciproc R25 and WO files in the coronal curvature (883.63 ± 282.56 and 916.53 ± 268.21 NCF, respectively) (P > 0.05). There was no difference in fractured fragment lengths of the WOG primary, Reciproc R25, and WO primary files in either the apical or coronal curvature (P > 0.05).
2:::Questionnaire completion rates are compared between (i) participants being approached in child development centre waiting rooms and (ii), one year later, the same participants being invited to take part by phone, email and/or post.
3:::Analysis of data found a significant difference in the quality of nursing documentation in the two hospitals both before and after the implementation of an EHR system (p < 0.001).Quality of nursing documentation in the electronic system was significantly better than that of paper-based documentation systems.
4:::The FISSA valid and reliable for individuals with CP. It allows for identification of the activities that may be compromised by fatigue to enhance collaborative goal setting and intervention planning.
3:::We identified 9945 vape shops in the USA as of December 2015, a nearly threefold increase from 2013. Among the 2755 colleges included in this study, 66.5% had at least 1 vape shop within a 3-mile radius. The median proximity of the nearest vape shop to each college/university was 1.8 miles. Proximity increased by student population, private as compared to public institutions, and location (city vs rural). Within a 1-mile radius, colleges with smoke-free campus policies had a lower density of vape shops (RR=0.6, p=0.002) than those without smoke-free campus policies. Private institutions had a higher density of vape shops (RR=7.8, p<0.0001) than did public institutions. Colleges with campus housing had a lower density of vape shops (RR=0.4, p<0.0001) than those without campus housing, and colleges located in cities had a much higher density of vape shops than those located in rural areas (RR=6.6, p<0.0001). Smoke-free and e-cigarette-free campus policies had significant interactions with college type (private vs public) and campus housing in reducing vape shop density.
2:::Thirteen qualitative case studies were undertaken. A parent, a teacher/key worker and a therapist for each CYP were interviewed, and daily routines were observed, with selective video recording. Single case and cross case analyses were undertaken.
1:::To describe a case of acute endophthalmitis caused by Actinomyces neuii after intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injection.
3:::Infection of graft material or graft bed was not observed and graft sites healed without any notable complications in both groups. The vertical dimensions of alveolar bone increased by 5.38 ± 2.65 mm in AutoBT group and 6.56 ± 3.54 mm in Bio-Oss(®) group at 6 months post-extraction. Histomorphometrically, new bone formation of AutoBT-grafted site was 31.24 ± 13.87% while that of Bio-Oss(®) was 35.00 ± 19.33%. The implant stability quotient (ISQ) of implants placed in AutoBT-grafted sites measured 72.80 ± 10.81 while those placed in Bio-Oss(®) -grafted sites measured 70.0 ± 12.86. There were no statistically significant differences between measurements of the two groups.
4:::The findings of this present study suggest that both surface morphology and Nd:YAG laser irradiation influence the proliferation and differentiation potential of MG-63 cells.
3:::The effects of perceived physical suffering on depression were completely mediated through intrusive thoughts, and compassion moderated the relation between physical suffering and intrusive thoughts. Caregivers who had greater compassion reported more intrusive thoughts even when perceived physical suffering of the CR was low. For perceived psychological suffering, the effects of suffering on depression were partially mediated through intrusive thoughts.
2:::A 12-year-old girl presented with unilateral neuroretinitis with stellate maculopathy. Bartonellosis was confirmed after serologic testing for antibodies to B. quintana.
3:::Three hundred and five participants including 52 contact lens wearers completed the study and 78 of them measured body fat %. There was a moderate correlation between body fat % and dry eye symptoms (SFDEQ r=0.34, P=0.003; OCI r=0.32, P=0.004). The interaction between body fat % and gender, wear of contact lenses, and older age were shown to be significant predictors of less ocular comfort in multivariate analysis (F(3,74)=12.13, P<0.001).
4:::This is the first study to show that academic achievement is a common factor in the development of perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns, whereas academic efficacy plays a role only in the development of perfectionistic strivings. Implications of the findings for the development of perfectionism are discussed.
2:::This outpatient memory clinic-based intervention study included a pre-/post-test survey design with two nonequivalent groups and predominately serves Hispanic and African Americans. Of 60 eligible caregivers, 67% participated in a tailored, safety training class with an optional follow-up call.
3:::Participants were predominantly women (61% of patients and 76% of caregivers) and racial/ethnic minorities (65% of patients and 63% of caregivers). Based on PHQ9 cutoffs, 30% of patients and 20% of caregivers had mild depression; 30% of patients and 8% of caregivers had moderate to severe depression. Multilevel models with the dyad as the unit of analysis showed that less frequent patient self-management, higher levels of caregiver burden, and being in poorer health were associated with higher levels of depression for both dyad members. Higher levels of depression in a partner were also associated with higher levels of depression for women, regardless of whether women were patients or caregivers.
3:::Only 6.6% of caregivers discontinued the study. In the CBC and BAC groups, attendance and satisfaction with the intervention were similarly high among both groups. Homework adherence was also high in both groups. At post-treatment, there was a lower incidence of depression in the CBC and BAC groups compared to the CG (0.0% for BAC and CBC vs. 10.5% for CG). The relative risk was 0.0, and number needed to treat was 10 in both groups. Depressive symptoms were significantly reduced in the CBC and BAC groups compared to the CG (d = 2.18 and d = 2.06).
4:::DCNs might contribute toward moderate to low caregiver burden. Indicators of positive caregiving aspects can be used by DCNs to advance support structures for informal caregivers drawing upon interventions already established for other community settings. Particular interest should be paid to female and spousal caregivers who might be in in need of greater and/or different kinds of support.
2:::A retrospective interventional case series of patients evaluated and treated from September 2009 through June 2014 at a single multi-specialty institutional practice. Eighteen of 29 patients with exposure keratoconjunctivitis, lagophthalmos, ectropion, or lid retraction, referred to USC Eye Institute after failing conventional therapies completed PROSE scleral lens fitting and were included in the study. Visual function was assessed before and after PROSE fitting with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) survey. Visual acuity (VA) and corneal staining changes were also evaluated before and after treatment.
3:::IL-32 is detected under positive selection using the FST simulations method. The phylogenetic tree revealed that goat IL-32 was in close resemblance with sheep IL-32. The coding nucleotide sequences were compared among 11 species and it was found that the goat IL-32 gene shared identity with sheep (96.54%), bison (91.97%), camel (58.39%), cat (56.59%), buffalo (56.50%), human (56.13%), dog (50.97%), horse (54.04%), and rabbit (53.41%) respectively.
2:::Prospectively enrolled women at high risk of preeclampsia were included. Transabdominal UAD measurements and serum biomarkers were collected between 11 and 13 weeks of gestation in three university hospitals and in one general hospital. The main outcome was preeclampsia. UAD parameters and biomarker levels among women with preeclampsia were compared with those of women in the unaffected group in univariate and multivariate analyses.
3:::Out of 226 women included from May 2007 to January 2011, 27 (11.9%) women developed preeclampsia. Among women affected by preeclampsia, the lowest pulsatility index was higher (p = 0.02), bilateral notching was more frequent (p = 0.01), and PlGF was lower (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed for other indicators. The multivariate model, adjusted for laboratory and sonographic indicators, had an area under the curve (AUC) estimated at 0.76, which was not significantly different from the AUC of the univariate model adjusted only for PlGF (p = 0.7).
4:::Iodine intake was adequate, although higher than necessary when four or more glasses of milk were consumed, and/or when the milk was skimmed. The consumption of dairy products should be monitored to prevent both excessive and deficient intake of iodine.
3:::DPI and NAC efficiently decreased ROS level in L. monocytogenes without affecting bacterial growth. Moreover, the apoptosis of glial cells was enhanced upon invasion of DPI- and NAC-pretreated L. monocytogenes.
1:::To evaluate the outcomes of arthroscopic transtendon repair of partial articular-sided supraspinatus tendon avulsion (PASTA) in a large study group.
2:::The study have been done by using Stationary photolysis, Laser flash photolysis, Time-resolved phosphorence detection of O2(1Δg) experiments and Bactericidal activity evaluation. The experiments were carried out in aqueous solution at different pH values in order to establish relationships between the structure of the compound and its susceptibility to ROS-mediated photooxidation.
3:::Experimental evidence indicates that in the presence of Rf there is considerable contribution of the radical-mediated mechanism, while in the presence of RB the photooxidation process occurs exclusively through O2(1Δg) and the reactivity to this excited species increases with increasing pH of the environment.
4:::Even with significant differences in patients baseline characteristics; in-hospital and mid-term stroke rates are not significantly higher following TAVR than SAVR. Although periprocedural stroke is not uncommon in TAVR, mid-term stroke rate is low.'
3:::The participants conversational behavior was sensitive to a conversation-partner's attention as a consequence. Lag contingencies successfully altered the prevalence of CI-related and-unrelated talk.'
2:::A survey was circulated at a communication training course for oncology nurses in June 2015. Nurses recalled a care experience that included the initiation of a spiritual care topic and their response to the patient/family. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
4:::The incidence of delirium after the commencement of fentanyl injection was significantly lower, suggesting that fentanyl is a useful opioid injection drug from the perspective of delirium risk.
3:::Across 10 cases (20.4 operative hours), attendings spent 11.2 hours (54.7%) teaching, using directing (M = 250.1), and confirming (M = 236.1) most. FDs occurred 410 times, accounting for 4.4 hours of case time (21.57%). Teaching occurred with FD events for 2.4 hours (22.2%), whereas 77.8% of teaching happened outside FD occurrence. Teaching methods shifted from active to passive during FD events to compensate for patient safety.
3:::Long-term intervention effects were found for emotional well-being (p = 0.019). For the subgroup of caregivers who were still caring at home at follow-up, the intervention led to an increased health status (p = 0.023), fewer bodily complaints (global measure p= 0.014, rheumatic pain p = 0.027, heart trouble p = 0.042), and a higher quality of life (overall p = 0.044 and subscale environment p = 0.030).
2:::In situ, high-fidelity simulation scenarios of critically ill children presenting to a community hospital and progressing to cardiopulmonary arrest were performed. Scenarios were randomized to PCCM consultation via telephone (control) or telemedicine (intervention). Primary outcome measure was proportion of teams who successfully defibrillated in 180 seconds or less from presentation of pulseless ventricular tachycardia.
4:::This study demonstrates the feasibility of using telemedicine to support acute management of children who present to community hospitals. Neither study arm adhered to current resuscitation guidelines and telemedicine consultation with PCCM experts was not associated with improvement. However, further research on optimizing telemedicine impact on the quality of pediatric care at community hospitals is warranted.
3:::EoE-relevant inflammatory conditions promoted autophagy and basal cell hyperplasia in three independent murine EoE models and oesophageal organoids. Inhibition of autophagic flux via chloroquine treatment augmented basal cell hyperplasia in these model systems. Oesophageal keratinocytes stimulated with EoE-relevant cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin-13 exhibited activation of autophagic flux in a reactive oxygen species-dependent manner. Autophagy inhibition via chloroquine treatment or depletion of Beclin-1 or ATG-7, augmented oxidative stress induced by EoE-relevant stimuli in murine EoE, oesophageal organoids and human oesophageal keratinocytes. Oesophageal epithelia of paediatric EoE patients with active inflammation displayed increased autophagic vesicle content compared with normal and EoE remission subjects. Functional flow cytometric analysis revealed autophagic flux in human oesophageal biopsies.
3:::We found a significant Time × Group interaction effect (η² = .09), which indicates a larger competence increase in the CFG in comparison to the CG.
2:::Patients with endometrial cancer of all histologies clinically involving the cervix or parametria treated with neoadjuvant brachytherapy followed by extrafascial hysterectomy from 1999 to 2014 were identified. Patient charts were reviewed for data regarding treatment characteristics and postoperative outcomes. Pearson χ and logistic regression analyses were used to assess correlations between surgical complications and treatment-related variables.
1:::The purpose of this study is to describe the therapeutic approach to a patients criminal offense in a forensic mental health nurse-patient relationship from the nurse's perspective.'
4:::A considerable variation in the management of the first-line systemic therapy in children with moderate to severe psoriasis was observed. Cyclosporine was most commonly preferred as a first-line treatment. The availability of new therapeutic agents could change the scenario of treatment patterns in childhood psoriasis.
3:::For all parameters, there was excellent agreement between devices for BASE (r = 0·96-0·99), TILT (r = 0·89-1·00) and RECOVERY (r = 0·96-1·00). For the telemetric device, between-day intraclass coefficient values for RMSDD, SDNN and HF were all above the 0·75 criterion for each condition, indicating excellent between-day reliability. For each condition, the reliability coefficient, expressed as a percentage of the mean (RC%), was marginally lower (greater reliability) for RMSDD (RC% 11-13) and SDNN (RC% 10-12) compared to HF (RC% 12-17). However, SDNN did not significantly respond to the orthostatic challenge.
2:::A 3-year cohort study with a probabilistic representative sample of home-dwelling elders of one district of Mexico City was performed. Baseline and follow-up interview and oral clinical evaluations were carried out by standardized examiners in participants homes. Dependent variable was incident frailty defined according to the frailty phenotype. Independent variables were the utilization of dental services, the presence of xerostomia, the number of natural teeth, use of removable dental prostheses, presence of severe periodontitis, and presence of root remnants. Sociodemographic, behavioral, and health measures were included as confounders. The association between oral health conditions and incident frailty was modeled using Poisson regression models with robust variance estimators. The models were adjusted for confounders and interactions.'
3:::There were 5244 patients: 1432 (27.3%) before and 3812 (72.7%) after March 2012. Of the patients, 67.2% were male. The most common injuries were road traffic collisions (45.0%). Physicians were more likely to be present after (2345 missions, 61.5%) than before (529 missions, 36.9%) March 2012 (P<0.01). RSI was performed 434 (8.3%) times and was more likely during the latter than the former period [359 (9.4%) vs. 75 (5.2%), P<0.01]. Successful tracheal intubation was achieved in 99% of occasions.
1:::To describe opioid use before and after intensive care unit (ICU) admission and to identify factors associated with chronic opioid use upto 4 years after ICU discharge.
3:::Mean compression rate recorded was above 100/min in both positions throughout ECC. Mean compression depth for male participants was more than 38 mm for 5 min in the K-position but only 3 min in the S-position. Female participants achieved this compression depth for less than 90 s in the K-position but not at all in the S-position.
2:::Sixteen healthy men (age 26 ± 6 year; BMI 25·3 ± 2·7 kg m(-2) ) had measures of central haemodynamic load measured before/after a 30-s Wingate anaerobic test (WAT). Common carotid artery stiffness and reflected wave intensity were assessed via wave intensity analysis as a regional pulse wave velocity (PWV) and negative area (NA), respectively. Resting LV structure (LV mass) and function [midwall fractional shortening (mFS)] were assessed using M-mode echocardiography in the parasternal short-axis view.
4:::MS is a risk factor for decreased lung function in island residents ≥30 years old.
3:::TT increased ƒ (20 ± 5 vs 25 ± 4 breaths/min, P<0.05), MBP (90 ± 14 vs 94 ± 18 mmHg, P<0.05), HR (90 ± 17 vs 96 ± 12 beats/min, P<0.05), PET CO2 (33 ± 8 vs 48 ± 10 mmHg, P<0.05) and reduced SpO2 (98 ± 1.6 vs 96 ± 1.6%, P<0.05). In addition, LF increased (47 ± 18 vs 38 ± 12 nu, P<0.05) and HF reduced (29 ± 13 vs 32 ± 16 nu, P<0.05), resulting in higher LF/HF ratio (1.62 ± 2 vs 1.18 ± 1, P<0.05) during TT. Conversely, VT increased with PSV (0.58 ± 0.16 vs 0.50 ± 0.15 L, P<0.05) compared with TT.
2:::BPTs were performed in a cross-over fashion, at 2-4 day intervals. Cumulative doses eliciting 20% FEV1 fall (PD20 FEV1 ), diagnostic performance and adverse events (AEs) were compared. Patients with PD20 FEV1 lower than geometric mean were defined as responders, otherwise poor responders. Patients with uncontrolled and partly controlled asthma, who maintained their original inhaled corticosteroids therapy, underwent reassessment of airway responsiveness and asthmatic symptoms 3 and 6 months after.
3:::Fifteen prospective cohort studies investigating total fat and/or saturated fat intake (g/day) and breast cancer mortality were included. There was no difference in risk of breast-cancer-specific death (n = 6; HR = 1.14; 95% CI: 0.86, 1.52; p = 0.34) or all-cause death (n = 4; HR = 1.73; 95% CI: 0.82, 3.66; p = 0.15) for women in the highest versus lowest category of total fat intake. Breast-cancer-specific death (n = 4; HR = 1.51; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.09; p < 0.01) was higher for women in the highest versus lowest category of saturated fat intake.
4:::E-CEA can be performed safely, as a routine technique, based on the surgeons evaluation of arterial back-bleeding and an increase in ipsilateral arterial perfusion with standard anesthetic procedures. Also e-CEA may be considered a cost effective method of reducing the frequency of intra-arterial shunt placement and adjuncts used to assess adequate cerebral perfusion of the ipsilateral carotid artery during e-CEA.'
3:::Children with ADHD and PBD showed higher scores in the Hyperactive and Inattentive subscales of the ADHD Rating Scale, than children with ADHD alone. The frequency of combined subtype was significantly higher in ADHD children with PBD, than in those with ADHD alone. ADHD children with PBD showed a higher rate of familial psychiatric disorders than ADHD children without PBD. The rate of conduct disorder was significantly greater in children with PBD and ADHD compared with children with ADHD alone.
2:::In the first dimension, the column was GRACE Alltima C18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5μm), and the gradient elution used 0.02 mol·L(-1) ammonium dihydrogen phosphate solution and methanol as mobile phase. In the second dimension, the analytical column was Shimadzu Shim-pack GISS C18 (50 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.9 μm) with 10 mmol·L(-1) ammonium formate solution and methanol as mobile phase. Full scan LC-MS was first executed to obtain the exact m/z value of the molecules. Then LC-MS(2) and LC-MS(3) were performed on the compounds of interest.
3:::All 35 patients (mean age 56, 77% male) underwent left vocal-fold injection laryngoplasty without complication. There were 15 (43%) early procedures and 20 (57%) late procedures. Mean LOS for early and late injection groups (13 vs. 20 days, respectively) significantly differed (P = 0.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3 to 14.4). Early laryngoplasty cohorts experienced less pulmonary complications (20%) than those who had late medialization (50%), but this did not reach significance (P = 0.06, 95% CI -0.3 to 8.1). The most common complication type in both groups was therapeutic bronchoscopy.
4:::The immunodominant region (amino acids 31-270) of gE was expressed successfully in P. pastoris using a codon optimization strategy. ygEN31-270 was secreted and N-glycosylated. The ygEN31-270-based indirect sandwich ELISA showed high sensitivity and specificity to detect gE-specific antibodies in swine serum samples.
2:::Primary and assistant surgeons were randomized to wear either orthopedic reinforced gloves or double gloves. Gloves were leak tested to identify perforations at the end of procedures. Perforations detected intraoperatively or postoperatively were recorded. A contamination event was defined as at least one perforation on either hand for orthopedic reinforced gloves, or a perforation of both the inner and outer glove on the same hand for double gloves.
3:::The root mean squares of percent difference in organ dose when comparing the physical organ dose measurements to the computational estimates were 21.2, 12.1, and 15.1% for the uniform (no attenuation weighting), weighted (computationally derived), and image-based methodologies, respectively.
2:::The validation of Italian frailty index (IFi) is based on a cohort study that enrolled 1077 non-disabled outpatients aged 65 years or older (81.3 ± 6.5 years) in Naples (Italy). IFi has been expressed as a ratio of deficits present/deficits considered after a comprehensive geriatric assessment. IFi was stratified in light, moderate and severe frailty. Mortality, disability (considering an increase in ADL lost ≥1 from the baseline) and hospitalization were considered at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of follow-up. Area under curve (AUC) was evaluated for both Frieds and IFi frailty index.'
4:::IFi is a valid measure of frailty after the comprehensive geriatric assessment in an Italian cohort of non-institutionalized patients.
3:::Frankel grade improved by 1 in 13 patients and by 2 in 1 patient. One patient of T11/12 GHTD with neurogenic claudication recovered completely, taking the overall improvement rate to 45.5%. It remained static in 15 patients (45.5%) and deteriorated by 1 in 3 patients (9%). By mJOA scoring too, the outcome was favorable in majority (84.4%) of patients. There were three intraoperative complications (9%), which included two incidental durotomies and one massive blood loss. Late postoperative complications were seen in 12(39%) patients. They included intercostal neuralgia, mechanical pain around costotransversectomy, progressive thoracic paraplegia due to spinal cord herniation and residual disc fragments, reactive pleural effusion, CSF fistula induced pleural effusion, and infective discitis.
1:::To evaluate the correlation between measurements from quantitative thoracic high-resolution CT (HRCT) analysis with ""Computer-Aided Lung Informatics for Pathology Evaluation and Rating"" (CALIPER) software and measurements from pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM)-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD).
3:::Thirty participants (18M:12F; age: 64 ± 7 years; BMI: 28 ± 5 kg/m(2); HbA1c: 7.0 ± 1.0%) completed the study, and consumed 5.5 and 4.9 g/day of fibre from KGB and wheat bran control, respectively, and 2.7 g/day of AG. At week 12, HbA1c levels were 0.31% lower on the KGB and AG compared to control (p = 0.011). Mean (±SEM) plasma lipids decreased on the KGB and AG vs control by 8.3 ± 3.1% in LDL-C (p = 0.002), 7.5 ± 2.4% in non-HDL-C (p = 0.013), 5.7 ± 1.9% in total-C (p = 0.012), 4.1 ± 2.1% in total-C:HDL-C ratio (p = 0.042), 9.0 ± 2.3% in ApoB (p = 0.0005) and 14.6 ± 4.2% in ApoB:ApoA1 ratio (p = 0.049).
2:::Fifty-seven patients with pathologically diagnosed meningiomas (benign, 44; atypical, 13), who underwent preoperative MRI with APT imaging between December 2014 and August 2016 were included. We compared normalised magnetisation transfer ratio asymmetry (nMTR asym ) values between benign and atypical meningiomas on APT-weighted images. Conventional MRI features were qualitatively assessed. Both imaging features were evaluated by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The discriminative value of MRI with and without nMTR asym was evaluated.
4:::A substantial proportion of cHP cases have a non-HP-like appearance. Ground-glass opacity, pulmonary fibrosis features and elevated PA/aorta ratio on CT likely reflect varying degrees of disease severity in cHP and may inform future clinical prediction models.
1:::Although collagen microstructural crimp is a major determinant of ocular biomechanics, no direct measurements of optic nerve head (ONH) crimp have been reported. Our goal was to characterize the crimp period of the lamina cribrosa (LC) and peripapillary sclera (PPS) at low and normal IOPs.
3:::SF artificial endothelial grafts showed the characteristic endothelial markers: zonula occludens (ZO-1) and Na+/K+ ATPase. In a rabbit model of DMEK surgery, SF artificial endothelial graft restored the corneal transparency and thickness at 6 week of follow-up. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography revealed the SF graft as a fully integrated component in the corneal tissue, displaying a similar corneal thickness and endothelial cell count when compared with its healthy contralateral cornea. Histologic analysis showed that the SF artificial endothelial graft was attached and integrated on the surface of the corneal stroma without a significant inflammatory reaction, and rabbit CECs consisted in a monolayer that showed their characteristic markers ZO-1 and Na+/K+ ATPase, suggesting proper intercellular junctions and cellular pump function.
4:::This study demonstrated that S. aureus is found intracellularly within CRSwNP tissue at multiple time points without an increase in the number of eosinophils, lymphocytes and neutrophils. This finding supports our hypothesis that ICSA is able to escape from host detection and resides within the sinonasal mucosa despite intense treatment.
2:::We pooled datasets of 11 stroke registries from Europe and America. ESUS was defined according to the Cryptogenic Stroke/ESUS International Working Group. We performed Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier product limit analyses to investigate whether age (<60, 60-80, >80 years) and sex were independently associated with the risk for ischemic stroke/TIA recurrence or death.
3:::The hazard ratio (HR) for patients with MS was 2.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.86-2.99) for all-cause mortality over the entire study period. The largest differences between the cohorts were death resulting from respiratory (HR 5.07, 95% CI 4.87-5.26) and infectious (HR 4.07, 95% CI 3.70-4.47) diseases. Overall and for each specific cause, there have been improvements for the MS group and a subsequent reduction in the HR. The HR decreased from 6.52 (95% CI 5.79-7.34) for the period of 1968 to 1980 to 2.08 (95% CI 1.95-2.22) for the time period of 2001 to 2012. An interaction between time period and MS exposure showed that the decrease in mortality over time was statistically significant, with a larger decrease for patients with MS than their matched comparators.
4:::The proposed dimension reduction in frequency measures based on VAR constitutes an appropriate strategy to estimate reliably brain networks within short-time windows.
3:::The methodology is robust and was successful in our hands on the first attempt. On average, we were able to isolate hundreds (535.7 and 806.9 in two animals) of high quality units in each session during one month of recording.
2:::Participants were postmenopausal Japanese women with osteoporosis aged 55-85years with a lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry T-score≤-2.5. Women were randomized to receive placebo or romosozumab (70, 140, or 210mg) subcutaneously once monthly (QM) for 12months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at month 12. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the percentage change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at month 6, total hip and femoral neck BMD at months 6 and 12, and serum bone turnover markers procollagen type 1N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) at multiple visits.
3:::Analyses included data from 18 plans providing coverage in 31 of the 39 states with MMCOs (response rate, 90.0%). Responding MMCOs were diverse: 55.6% were multistate, 33.3% were nonprofit, and 31.2% covered more than 1,000,000 lives. Most respondents (87.5%) covered branded progesterone, and 81.3% covered compounded progesterone. Prior authorization was required by most plans for branded progesterone (86.7%) or compounded progesterone (75.0%). The MMCO gestational age restrictions for initiating progesterone varied from 22 to 37 weeks of gestation, even within the same state. MMCO-identified barriers to providing progesterone included cost, lack of clinician knowledge of indications and coverage, and variation in billing procedures.
4:::The rate of hepatitis B reported and the rate of HBsAg positivity decreased significantly in Zhejiang province by maintaining the high-level coverage rate of the hepatitis B timely birth dose and three-dose schedule. While additional efforts are needed to achieve the goal of elimination.
2:::The Living Organ Video Educated Donors (LOVED) program is a theory-guided iterative designed, mixed methods study incorporating three phases: 1) a formative evaluation using focus groups to develop program content and approach; 2) a 2-month proof of concept trial (n=27) to primarily investigate acceptability, tolerability and investigate increases of LDKT knowledge and self-efficacy; and 3) a 6-month, 2-arm, 60-person feasibility randomized control trial (RCT) to primarily investigate increases in LDKT knowledge and self-efficacy, and secondarily, to increases the number of living donor inquiries, medical evaluations, and LDKTs. The 8-week LOVED program includes an interactive web-based App delivered on 10″ tablet computer incorporating weekly interactive video education modules, weekly group video chat sessions with an African American navigator who has had LDKT and other group interactions for support and improve strategies to promote their need for a kidney.
3:::Phase 1 and 2 have been completed and now the program is currently enrolling for the feasibility RCT. Phase 2 experienced 100% retention rates with 91% adherence completing the video modules and 88% minimum adherence to the video chat sessions.
3:::The main problems of maternal health services identified by tacit knowledge are related to poor quality of care, while the predominant problems studied in the scientific literature are related to access barriers to health services. Approximately, 70% of the problems identified by tacit knowledge are also mentioned in the explicit knowledge. Conversely, 70% of the problems identified in the literature are also considered by tacit knowledge. Nevertheless, when looking at the problems taken one by one, no statistically significant similarities were found.
1:::To compare one-muscle versus two-muscle surgery for moderate-angle hyperdeviations due to presumed unilateral fourth nerve palsy.
2:::A 3D radial trajectory with double golden-angle ordering was used for free-running data acquisition during free breathing in 9 healthy volunteers. A respiratory self-gating signal was extracted from the center of k-space and used with the electrocardiogram to bin all data into 3 respiratory and 25 cardiac phases. 3D image volumes were reconstructed and the LV endocardial border was segmented. LV volume measurements and reproducibility from 3D free breathing cine were compared to conventional 2D breath-held cine.
4:::GBMP1a was demonstrated to be a good inducer of GSC differentiation, thus being considered a potential anti-cancer tool to be further developed for GBM treatment.
3:::There were 561 errors in 477 examinations; 290 (46%) errors occurred in the abdomen/pelvis, 99 (15.7%) in the chest, 117 (18.5%) in the CNS, and 125 (19.9%) in the MSK system. In each body system, the five most common location were chest: lung bases on computed tomography (CT), apices on radiography, pulmonary vasculature, bones, and mediastinum; abdominopelvic: vasculature, colon, kidneys, liver, and pancreas; CNS: intracranial vasculature, peripheral cerebral grey matter, bone, parafalcine, and the frontotemporal lobes surrounding the Sylvian fissure; and MSK: calvarium, sacrum, pelvis, chest, and spine.
2:::Thirty-five healthy male adults New Zealand White rabbits were assigned to seven different groups. Four groups were fed 1% cholesterol diet and 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mL of BA fruit juice per kg of rabbit daily (atherogenic groups), while the other three groups were fed commercial rabbit pellet and 0, 0.5, and 1.0 mL of juice per kg of rabbit daily (normocholesterolemic groups) for 90 days. The thoracic and abdominal aorta between the heart origin and bifurcation into iliac arteries of all the rabbits were carefully removed and analyzed accordingly.
3:::Out of 56,461 primary care patients at BWH, we identified 5593 (9.9%) who had CKD based on albuminuria or estimated GFR. Referring patients identified by the computable criteria would have resulted in 2240 additional referrals to nephrology. In 2013, this would represent a 38.0% (2240/5892) increase in total nephrology patient volume and 67.3% (2240/3326) increase in new referral volume.
4:::This is the first study to examine the projected impact of implementing the 2012 KDIGO referral recommendations. Given the large increase in the number of referrals, this study is suggestive that implementing the KDIGO referral guidelines may not be feasible under current practice models due to a supply-demand mismatch. We need to consider new strategies on how to deliver optimal care to CKD patients using the available workforce in the U.S. health care system.
3:::New teaching was introduced at seven medical schools. A variety of pedagogies were represented. Collaboration between schools motivated and informed participants. The main challenges faced related to time pressures. Educators and students commented that new teaching was enjoyable and effective at improving knowledge and skills.
2:::Secondary data analysis of the 2008 Canadian Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect (CIS-2008) was conducted to identify the case characteristics (such as referral source, investigation type, and primary maltreatment type) and short-term service outcome (such as substantiation decision and decision to transfer to ongoing child protection services) of child maltreatment investigations involving Asian-Canadian children and families in the child welfare system. The results were presented to focus group participants in a workshop, and a semi-structured interview guide was used to document child welfare workers experience with and perception of Asian-Canadian service users.'
4:::Although NICE has attempted to adopt an approach flexible to patients and carers through formal decision-making arrangements that incorporate patient views, nonetheless, the processes of the STAs can in fact undermine the very evidence collected from patient representatives.
1:::To develop a phantom for validating MRI pulse sequences and data processing methods to quantify microscopic diffusion anisotropy in the human brain.
3:::The phantom was observed to have values of mean diffusivity similar to brain tissue, and relaxation times compatible with echo-planar imaging echo times on the order of 100 ms. The estimated values of µFA were at the theoretical maximum of 1.0, whereas the values of FA spanned the interval from 0.0 to 0.8 as a result of varying orientational order of the anisotropic domains within each voxel.
2:::The electronic databases Web of Science and PubMed/Medline were searched for papers containing a quantitative estimate of future heat-related mortality. The search was limited to papers published in English in peer-reviewed journals up to the end of March 2017. Reference lists of relevant papers and the citing literature were also examined. The wide range of locations studied and climate data used prevented a meta-analysis.
4:::The treatment of Loa hyper-microfilaraemic individuals with ivermectin produces a clinical spectrum that parallels that seen in Loa hyper-microfilaraemic humans treated with ivermectin. The utilization of this experimental model can contribute to the improved management of the adverse responses in humans.
3:::More than 1000 mg/L teicoplanin were released within the first 24 hours and 28.22 mg/L after 168 hours. Amikacin release was above 10,000 mg/L within the first 24 hours and still 120.8 mg/L after 120 hours. A release of polyhexanide could be verified for the first 24 hours only. Consequently teicoplanin and amikacin released from PRF showed antimicrobial in-vitro effects for almost a week, whereas an antimicrobial effect of polyhexanide could only be verified for the first 24 hours.
2:::All transbronchial biopsies (TBBX) from patients who received lung transplantation between 2000 to 2010 were reviewed. BALF concentrations of the CXCR3 ligands (CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11) were compared between episodes of OP and ""healthy"" biopsies using linear mixed-effects models. The association between CXCR3 ligand concentrations during OP and CLAD risk was evaluated using proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates.
3:::For the 17-item subscale, sensitivities were generally high using either cutoff (range: 0.79-1.00), although a cutoff of 1 was superior (sensitivities were 1.00 for AUD, CUD, and for either disorder). Specificities were also high using either cutoff (range: 0.81-0.95), but were higher using a cutoff of 2. For the 11-item subscale, a cutoff of 1 yielded higher sensitivities than a cutoff of 2 (ranges for 1 and 2: 0.96-1.00 and 0.79-0.86, respectively). Specificities for this subscale were higher using a cutoff of 2 (ranges for 1 and 2: 0.82-0.89 and 0.89-0.96, respectively).
4:::Findings suggest that the POSITs substance use/abuse subscale is a potentially useful tool for screening adolescents in primary care for AUD or CUD using a cutoff of 1 or 2. The briefer, revised subscale may be preferable to the standard subscale in busy pediatric practices.'
2:::This is a retrospective analysis of 48,674 females who joined TOPS from 2005 to 2011 and had a birth date in the database. Predictors of CSWL were evaluated using log-binomial regression and adjusted relative risks [99% CI] for participant age, initial weight, number of members per chapter, and chapter age.
3:::Primary NPC was identified in 207 patients and 42 (20%) had keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The stage distribution was: I, 11%; II, 25%; III, 39%; IV, 25%. Of 191 patients treated with curative intent 85 (44%) received radiotherapy and 106 (56%) chemoradiotherapy. The five-year overall survival for all patients was 57% and for stages I-IV 87%, 69%, 55% and 31%, respectively. The five-year disease-specific and overall survival of all patients treated between 1990 and 1999 were 58% and 49%, and those between 2000 and 2009 66% and 63%, respectively.
4:::While survival rates are improving and comparable to other western countries they remain inferior to those of endemic countries. This may reflect the different biology of NPC in nonendemic areas, where keratinizing SCC is common.
2:::In 29 renal allograft recipients samples were drawn once pre-Tx, and before and 1.5 hours after Tac-dosing at approximately 1 week, 6 weeks and 1 year post-Tx. Tac concentrations were measured by immunoassay, while the expression of NFAT-regulated cytokines (IL2, IFNG, CSF2) and CYP3A5 genotyping was determined by real-time PCR.
3:::The cytokine response after Tac dosing varied up to 46-fold between patients and changed significantly with time post-engraftment. Tac concentrations 1.5 hours post-dose (C1.5 ) >15 μg/L were associated with strong cytokine inhibition and residual gene expression (RGE) ≤10 %, while lower Tac C1.5 resulted in more variable responses (RGE 2.5-68.7%). Patients with ongoing subclinical acute rejection (n=5) demonstrated limited cytokine inhibition (RGE 39.7-72.6%), while patients with polyoma virus viremia (n=3) had relatively strong inhibition of cytokines (RGE 2.5-32.5%). In contrast, there was no association between Tac exposure and rejection or viremia.
4:::History of orthodontic treatment was associated with a decreased rate of periodontitis.
3:::We confirmed the influence of known genetic variants on warfarin dose variability. Our study is the first to show the association between rs12772169 and warfarin dose in African-Americans. In addition, genes COX15 and FGF5 showed significant association in European-Americans.
2:::Eleven well-trained cyclists completed a 750 kJ cycling time trial in each condition on separate days in a counter-balanced order. EEG activity was recorded with α and β activity evaluated in the frontal (F3 and F4) and central (C3 and C4) areas. Standardised low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) was also utilised to localise changes in cerebrocortical activity.
3:::After completing OIT for CM, children were able to reintroduce CM in their diet. For the first time, we demonstrated that OIT induced a significant increase in the peripheral blood iNKT, as well as their switch from a T helper (Th-2; i.e. IL-4, IL-13) to Th-1 (i.e. IFN-γ) cytokine profile.
4:::In summary, our results are original as compared to the rest of the literature, which involves rarely rodents, a simple BCI set-up has been developed in rats, the data show for the first time long-term, up to one year, unsupervised online control of an effector.
2:::Phase 1 included a household enumeration questionnaire mailed to randomly selected households (n = 1,950) in 3 Ohio Appalachian counties to identify members of the eligible subgroup. The second phase of recruitment involved contacting 1 randomly selected eligible woman enumerated by each household, based on return of the questionnaire. These women (n = 599) were invited by field interviewers to participate in a one-time in-person health survey.
3:::Findings indicated that 75.3% of this randomly selected sample reported lifetime injection of drugs. Contextual factors including drug use severity (RRR = 8.66, P < .001), more male sex partners (RRR = 1.01, P < .05), and having injecting partners (RRR = 7.60, P < .001) were robust correlates of recent injection practices.
2:::We evaluated 10,969 patients diagnosed with laryngeal cancer from 2010 to 2012 using cross-tabulations and multivariate regression.
4:::In commercially insured patients <65 years old with laryngeal cancer, chemoradiation was associated with increased costs, an increased likelihood of treatment-related medical complications, and a reduced likelihood of surgical salvage. Higher-volume surgical care was associated with lower initial treatment and 1-year costs of care. These data have implications for discussions of value and quality in an era of healthcare reform.
3:::Thirty-five PGY-1 residents successfully completed the program. These novices GRS scores improved significantly after the training (P < 0.001). Total path length measured with the ICSAD decreased significantly after the training (P = 0.008). Procedural time decreased significantly after training from 387 (310-501) seconds to 200 (157-261) seconds (median and interquartile range) (P = 0.029).'
3:::The clinical characteristics were similar at baseline. SSYX caused a significantly greater decline in the total number of VPCs than the placebo did (-2145 ± 2848 vs. -841 ± 3411, P < 0.05). The secondary endpoints of the LVEF, NYHA classification, NT-proBNP, 6MWD, and MLHFQ scores showed a greater improvements in the SSYX group than in the placebo group (ΔLVEF at 12th week: 4.75 ± 7.13 vs. 3.30 ± 6.53; NYHA improvement rate at the 8th and 12th week: 32.6% vs. 21.8%, 40.5% vs. 25.7%; mean level of NT-proBNP in patients with NT-proBNP ≥125 pg/ml at 12th week: -122 [Q1, Q3: -524, 0] vs. -75 [Q1, Q3: -245, 0]; Δ6MWD at 12th week: 35.1 ± 38.6 vs. 17.2 ± 45.6; ΔMLHFQ at the 4th, 8th, and 12th week: -4.24 ± 6.15 vs. -2.31 ± 6.96, -8.19 ± 8.41 vs. -3.25 ± 9.40, -10.60 ± 9.41 vs. -4.83 ± 11.23, all P < 0.05). CCEs were not different between the groups during the study period.
2:::A retrospective study included serological tests for HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B screening of milk donor candidates in the 2005-2015 period. The 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Poisson distribution.
1:::To summarize a review of dosimetry used in epidemiological studies being considered by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) in an evaluation of the linear no-threshold dose-response model that underpins the current framework of radiation protection.
4:::The two different criteria may impact the diagnostic yield of individuals with BrP, but do not affect the prognosis of the individuals with BrP.
3:::The patients with good CCC had significantly higher IGF-1 levels compared with the poor ones. On the contrary, hs-CRP was significantly lower in the good CCC group. We also demonstrated that IGF-1 level was significantly related with the grade of CCC.
2:::We used qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistics of transcribed interviews to identify themes in surrogates (n = 16) and physicians (n = 20).
3:::Grade 3 acute pancreatitis was observed in 23 patients (24.2%); acute pancreatitis of grade 4 or higher was not observed. The incidence of acute pancreatitis was lower in patients with atrophic pancreas than in those with non-atrophic pancreas (7.5 vs. 36.4%, p = 0.004). It was also lower in patients with main pancreatic duct (MPD) obstruction than in those without MPD obstruction (12.5 vs. 36.2%, p = 0.026). There was no difference in the incidence of acute pancreatitis between bare and covered stents.
3:::Hydrocortisone was used to treat AI in 34% (53/155) of patients. That subset of patients was demonstrably sicker, and mortality was expectedly higher for those treated with HC (37.7 vs. 17.6%, p = 0.0098). Of the subset of patients with random cortisol levels measured before initiation of HC, 67.7% (21/31) had low cortisol levels. No significant differences were seen in survival between the high and low groups, but mortality trended higher in patients with high cortisol levels that received HC. After multivariate analysis, duration of HC stress dose administration was associated with increased risk of mortality (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.2, p = 0.021), and total duration of HC treatment was associated with increased risk of sepsis (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.005-1.075, p = 0.026).
1:::Low oxygen levels, or hypoxemia, is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Hypoxemia is typically addressed by increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen, the use of mechanical ventilation, or more invasive measures. Recently, the injection of oxygen gas directly into the bloodstream by packaging it within lipid-based oxygen microbubbles (LOMs) has been explored. The purpose of this work is to examine the acute hemodynamic effects of intravenous injections of LOMs.
2:::LOMs composed of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline and cholesterol were manufactured using a process of shear homogenization under an oxygen headspace. A 5 mL aliquot of either PlasmaLyte A, or low (37%) or high (55%) concentration LOMs (n = 10 per group) was injected over a 1 min period into Sprague Dawley rats instrumented for measurement of cardiac index and pulmonary (PVR) and systemic (SVR) vascular resistance during a 60 min observation period. Hemodynamics were compared between groups by linear mixed modeling.
4:::Building on the successes of Ko-Pamoja, future versions are being developed in the region. These versions will be adapted to take into account our lessons learned while maintaining the Afrocentric lens and community-focussed approach, in order to promote cancer screening and ultimately improve outcomes.
3:::The study was halted due to poor accrual. Seven patients were enrolled (05/2011-11/2014). One patient withdrew consent prior to treatment, leaving six evaluable patients. Treatment was discontinued, due to the following reasons: disease progression (4); withdrawal (1); and grade 4 (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy (1). The median number of cycles administered was 4 (range: 2-29, total: 49). Four patients had >1 dose reduction due to the following reasons: fatigue (1), abnormal liver tests (2), hypertension and (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy (1), and headaches (1). Common severe (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 grades 3-5) toxicities were as follows: hypertension (3/6), (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy (2/6), diarrhea (1/6), fatigue (1/6), headache (1/6), and hematuria (1/6). One confirmed partial response was observed in PGL (17%, duration 2.4 years); median progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.5 and 14.8 months, respectively.
2:::Forty patients undergoing PPM implant were prospectively enrolled. Patients with pre-existing moderate or severe TR or an RVSP >50 mmHg were excluded. Pre- and immediate post-implantation transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) analyzed TR grade according to established methods. 3D TTE was utilized to determine lead position in relation to tricuspid leaflets as well as lead mobility across the TV.
3:::Cataract development was fast in diabetic rats that were exposed to unattenuated white light or to bright colored lights during the light phase. Diabetic rats that were kept under attenuated brown or yellow light during the light phase exhibited slower rate of cataract development. Electroretinogram responses indicated very severe retinal damage in diabetic rats kept under bright colored lights in the blue-yellow range or bright white light during the light phase. Electroretinogram damage was milder in rats kept under bright red light or attenuated yellow or brown light during the light phase. Glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in retinal Müller cells was consistent with ERG assessment of retinal damage.
2:::The authors reviewed the literature and discuss older POC tests for TV detection, as well as the OSOM lateral flow test, the AmpliVue test, the Solana test and the GeneXpert test as well as the limitations of wet preparation and culture for detection of TV.
4:::Our findings showed no effect of statins on the risk of developing SLE among patients aged ≥40 years. Further research is needed to study the long-term effects of statins on SLE.
3:::Five studies with 107 patients, contributed to a summative quantitative outcome in adults. The combined sensitivity of MRI virtopsy was 0.82 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.94) with a diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 11.1 (95% CI 2.2 to 57.0). There was no significant heterogeneity between studies (Q=1.96, df=4, p=0.75, I(2)=0). Eight studies, with 953 patients contributed to a summative quantitative outcome in children. The combined sensitivity of MRI virtopsy was 0.73 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.84) with a DOR of 6.44 (95% CI 1.36 to 30.51). There was significant heterogeneity between studies (Q=34.95, df=7, p<0.01, I(2)=80).
2:::YWHAB expression and rat aortic endothelial cell (RAOEC) vitality were examined using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blot analysis in cells treated with different glucose concentrations (5.6, 10, 15, 25, or 35 mM). For in vivo experiments, a YWHAB small interfering (si) RNA recombinant lentiviral vector (YWHAB-LV) or Mock siRNA recombinant lentiviral vector (Mock-LV) were injected into streptozotocin-induced DM SD rats via the tail vein. YWHAB expression and carotid artery morphology were assessed 7 days post injury using immunofluorescence (IF) and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. The proliferation and migration of Mock-LV and YWHAB-LV-infected RAOECs treated with 25 mM glucose were examined using cell scratch tests and flow cytometry. BCL2-Associated X (BAX) distribution in RAOECs treated with 25 mM glucose was examined using IF staining and western blot analysis.
3:::Western blot, qRT-PCR, and CCK-8 analyses demonstrated that both YWHAB expression and cell vitality increased with increasing glucose concentration (p <0.05). YWHAB IF staining was increased in DM rats compared with the normal group (p <0.05). HE staining showed that intimal hyperplasia is alleviated in YWHAB-silenced DM rats (p <0.05). YWHAB silencing suppressed the proliferation and migration of RAOECs treated with 25 mM glucose (p <0.05). Moreover, western blot analyses and IF staining demonstrated that YWHAB silencing increased the translocation of BAX from the cytoplasm to mitochondria in RAOECs treated with 25 mM glucose (p <0.05).
4:::The present study was the first one to demonstrate the gastroprotective effect of DOP through inhibiting oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. This study provided a solid evidence for the potential use of DO as a therapy or health supplement for gastric mucosal diseases.
3:::Thirty studies were analyzed with a total of 22,499 patients, 3967 of whom received AC. Eleven cohorts included Western patients and 19 were Asiatic. Surgeries were classified as R0 with negative margins, R1 with positive microscopic and R2 with positive macroscopic margins. Weighted mean OS difference among experimental (AC) and control arm was 4.3 months (95% CI 0.88-7.79, P = 0.014). AC reduced the risk of death by 41% (Hazard ratio [HR] = 0.59, 95% CI 0.49-0.71; P < 0.001).
2:::A retrospective review of 2,877 consecutive liver transplants performed at a single institution was studied. Data regarding recipient, donor, and operative characteristics, including detailed granular operative times were collected prospectively and retrospectively reviewed. Using an instrument variable approach, Cox multivariate modeling was performed to assess the impact of operative time without the confounding of known and unknown variables.
1:::Various surgical methods to prevent intraoperative and postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks during transsphenoidal approach (TSA) surgeries have been reported, but surgical techniques to address large dural defects have been less thoroughly investigated in the literature. The authors retrospectively evaluated the usefulness of the sandwich technique using fibrin-coated collagen fleece (TachoSil) to prevent intraoperative CSF leakage from large dural defects in TSA surgery.
3:::The 95% limits of agreement for maximal axial diameter and tumour volume were ±22.3% and ±42.8%, respectively. The within-subject coefficient of variation and reproducibility coefficient were 7.9% and 0.564 for maximal axial diameter and 22.9% and 5.069 for tumour volume. All intraclass correlation coefficients for maximal axial diameter and tumour volume demonstrated excellent agreement (all intraclass correlation coefficients >0.9). Peritumoural infiltration (odds ratio: 7.189; confidence interval: 1.815-28.469; p=0.005) was an independent risk factor for high interobserver variability.
4:::The combination approach is able to enhance the efficiency of hypothermia and efficacy of hypothermia-induced neuroprotection following ischemic stroke. The findings here move us a step closer towards translating this long recognized TH from bench to bedside.
2:::We tested the in vitro effects of Meto in HEK293 cells and in ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal rats. In vivo, we assessed the effects of Meto in MI wild-type and β3AR knockout mice.
3:::Proportion of ascites was lower in TissuFleece/Tissucol Duo(®) group. The ascites volume was lower in TachoSil(®) group. In sealant groups, increased adhesion specially in the TachoSil(®) group was seen. A reduction of the ""bilioma rate"" was seen in sealant groups, which was significantly lower in TissuFleece(®)/Tissucol Duo(®) group.
2:::We used ENCODE project histone modification and transcription factor binding data to determine the regulatory features of a GCKR intronic locus formed by the high linkage disequilibrium rs780094(C/T), rs780095(G/A), and rs780096(G/C) SNPs. Characterization of the transcriptional activity of this region was assessed by luciferase reporter assays in HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. ChIP-qPCR was used to determine the levels of haplotype specific transcription factor binding and histone marks. A CRISPR-dCas9 transcriptional activator system and qPCR were used to activate the locus and measure GCKR expression, respectively. Differential haplotype expression was measured from human liver biopsies.
4:::The high proportions of limited' health literacy among school teachers in the Colombo Education Zone and the need of interventional programmes should be brought to the attention of the policy makers in the education and health sectors. Improving health literacy among teachers and adoption of the Health Promoting School concept as a evidence based path to improve health literacy should be highlighted in the advocacy efforts. Identified factors associated with 'limited' health literacy should be taken into in the interventional efforts.'
3:::Overall, 53 (12.9%) respondents were found to be fully vaccinated. The multivariable logistic regression showed that, those respondents who are female, had ≥10 years of work experience and those working at governmental health care institutions were significantly associated with vaccination status (AOR = 3.84, 12.51, 2.45 respectively).
2:::A free-list instrument and a structured survey were developed and used to gather data on changes in diet, activity, and womens roles from ten grandmothers in rural India.'
3:::Out of 575 clinical samples processed, 280 (48.7%) were culture positive for aerobic bacteria pathogens. Wound 238 (41.4%) and urine 108 (18.8%) were the most frequent samples processed. Overall, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was the predominant isolate 100 (31.5%) followed by Escherichia coli (E. coli) 39 (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) 30 (10.3%) and Salmonella spp. 25 (8.9%). P. aeruginosa was the most frequent isolate followed by S. aureus from ear infection. E. coli was the leading isolate followed by Klebsiella spp. from urinary tract infection. Salmonella and Shigella spp. were the most frequent isolates in stool in children below 5 years of age. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae) 16 (76.2%) was the most common isolate from urethral discharge. The overall multidrug-resistant Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria isolates were 113 (84.6%) and 96 (72.2%), respectively. Gram positive bacteria revealed resistance to cotrimoxazole (80%), gentamicin (83.1%), amoxicillin (85.1%), ampicillin (85.8%), penicillin (89.7%), clindamycin (93.2%) and erythromycin (90.9%). Gram negative bacteria showed resistance to cotrimoxazole (53.1%), amoxicillin (58.8%), ampicillin (70.4%), tetracycline (75.9%) and gentamicin (76.9%).
4:::The observed differences are indicative of physiological costs of increased developmental plasticity, suggesting that the potential for plasticity is constrained by its costs. Thus, high levels of responsiveness in the developmental rate of tadpoles have evolved in islands with pools at high but variable risk of desiccation. Moreover, the physiological alterations observed may have important consequences for both short-term odds of survival and long term effects on lifespan.
2:::We interviewed health care professionals of ten care facilities, visited by the IGZ, who were involved in, or responsible for, the improvement of medication safety in their institutions. As outcome measures we used the rate of medication safety risk per facility; the perceptions of the participant with regard to the reports of medication incidents; the level of medication safety of the facility; the measures used to improve medication safety; and the supervision of medication safety. This was a mixed methods study, qualitative in that we used semi-structured interviews, and quantitative, by calculating risks for the different organisations we visited. The findings from both study methods resulted in a comprehensive view and an in-depth understanding of this contradiction.
3:::We found that 33.6% of patients and 1.3% of controls were carriers. Demographic characteristics of patients with G2019S had no differences compared with non-carrier patients. Thereby, we could emphasize the implication of G2019S in PD without any distinctive demographic factors in the studied cohort. Sixty patients out of 250 were genotyped using Taqman assay and Sanger sequencing. The genotyping results were found to be concordant with KASP assay.
2:::All individuals enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study who initiated a RPV/TDF/FTC co-formulation between April 2013 and March 2014 were included. Primary outcomes were the HIV-RNA viral load (copies/mL) and CD4 cell count (cells/mm(3)) at 6, 12 and 24 months. Reasons for a switch to RPV/TDF/FTC were evaluated through a standardized questionnaire. We also assessed discontinuation and reasons for discontinuation of RPV/TDF/FTC until October 30, 2015.
3:::364 adverse events were reported: 66.7% were medication errors, 2.7% adverse reactions to the medication (2 were wrongly classified as both, showing a total percentage &gt;100%) and 31% were other events. After refinement, the percentages were 69.5%, 5.8% and 24.7%, respectively (κ=0.85; CI95% [0.80-0.90]). Before refinement, 73.6% of medication errors were considered potential vs. 82.3% after refinement (κ=0.65; CI95% [0.54- 0.76]). The medication most frequently involved was trastuzumab (20.9%). The  ""molecule"" field was blank in 133 entries. A mean of 1.8±1.9 errors per entry were detected.
4:::Although agreement is good, the refinement process cannot be avoided, as it provides valuable information to improve pharmacotherapy. Data quality could be improved by reducing the number of type-in text fields, using drop-down lists, and by increasing the training of the reporters.
2:::Healthy Directions 2, a cluster-randomized controlled trial of an intervention conducted in two urban health centers, targeted five behaviors (physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, red meat consumption, multivitamin use, and smoking). The self-guided intervention emphasized changing MRB simultaneously, focused on self-monitoring and action planning, and encouraged participants to seek support from social network members. An MRB score was calculated for each participant, with one point being assigned for each behavioral recommendation that was not met. Analyses were conducted to identify demographic and social contextual factors (e.g., interpersonal, neighborhood, and organizational resources) associated with seeking support and to determine if type and frequency of offered support were associated with changes in MRB score.
3:::Half (49.6%) of participants identified a support person. Interpersonal resources were the only contextual factor that predicted engagement of a support person. Compared to individuals who did not seek support, those who identified one support person had 61% greater reduction in MRB score, and participants identifying multiple support persons had 100% greater reduction.
4:::In this large UK population-based study, no significant associations were observed for post-diagnostic use of statins, β-blockers or low-dose aspirin and EC survival.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 6 July 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2017.207 www.bjcancer.com.
3:::The detection rates of BPA, NP, and OP were 55.9%, 77.6%, and 68.3%, respectively. In this study, the median BPA, NP, and OP levels in 2-year-olds were 3.3, 72.6, and 3.3 (ng/ml), respectively. However, the median levels of BPA, NP, and OP were 3.2, 49.3, and 6.6 (ng/ml), respectively. The levels of phenolic compounds were log10-transformed for statistical analysis. Gender stratification was performed. In the WISC-IV neurocognitive assessment, we found both a significant negative association and a trend between cord blood plasma BPA levels and full-scale IQ (p for trend<0.01), the verbal comprehension index (p for trend<0.01), and the perceptual reasoning index (p for trend<0.01) in the study population. After stratification by sex, significant associations were found in full-scale IQ (p for trend=0.03) and the verbal comprehension (p for trend<0.01) index in boys. In girls, prenatal BPA exposure had adverse effects on full-scale IQ (p for trend=0.02), perceptual reasoning index (p for trend<0.01), and working memory index (p for trend=0.02). None of the developmental quotients (DQs) of the CDIIT analysis were significantly associated with phenolic compound levels in cord blood based on continuous or categorical measures.
2:::Of 52 upper UTI cases treated at Yamaguchi University between 2009 and 2016, 38 pediatric patients with AFBN (n=17) or APN (n=21) who underwent ultrasonography and/or CT were enrolled. The clinical data and serum cytokine concentrations were analyzed to differentiate AFBN from APN.
4:::To maximize effectiveness of lung cancer screening, minimize the burden of data collection, and facilitate research and quality improvement, clinical workflow and information technology should be purposefully designed to ensure patients meet eligibility criteria and receive appropriate follow-up testing.
3:::We compared phenotypes such as weight loss, disease activity, intestinal histological scores, and immunohistochemistry for inflammatory cells. Unlike WT and TLR4-/- mice, the severity of DSS-colitis did not improve in TLR2-/- animals after BF colonization. The BF enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 expression and inhibited pro-inflammatory-related tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and IL-6 mRNA expression in both WT and TLR4-/- mice. In contrast, the failed to up-regulated IL-10 and down-regulated the TNF-α and IL-6 in BF colonization TLR2-/- mice. In addition, we further perform IL-10-/- mice to clarify whether the BF through TLR2 /IL-10 pathway to alleviate DSS-colitis. There were no significant differences in colitis severity and pro-inflammatory related genes expression in the IL-10-/- mice with or without BF colonization.
2:::Data from a representative nation-wide community based household survey were used to estimate the number of bites and deaths nationally, and household and out of pocket costs were derived from household questionnaires. Health system costs were obtained from hospital cost accounting systems and estimates of antivenom usage. DALYs lost to snakebite were estimated using standard approaches using disability weights for poisoning.
3:::During the study period, a total of 180 patients were eligible for analyses. Median blood loss and operation time for locally recurrent rectal cancer were 2022 mL and 634 minutes. Five-year overall and 3-year relapse-free survival rates were 38.6% and 26.7%. Age (p = 0.002), initial tumor stage (p = 0.03), pain associated with locally recurrent rectal cancer (p = 0.03), CEA level (p = 0.004), resection margin (p < 0.001), intra-abdominal/pelvic inflammation (p < 0.001), and surgery period (p = 0.045) were independent prognostic factors associated with overall survival, whereas CEA level (p = 0.01), resection margin (p = 0.002), and intra-abdominal/pelvic inflammation (p = 0.001) were associated with relapse-free survival. Intra-abdominal/pelvic inflammation was observed in 45 patients (25.0%). A large amount of perioperative blood loss was the only factor associated with the occurrence of intra-abdominal/pelvic inflammation (p = 0.007).
2:::Skeletal muscle metabolism was assessed using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy and blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI in 29 MH-positive patients and 20 healthy controls. Traditional measures of physical capacity were employed to measure aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, and muscle strength.
4:::Results of this exploratory study suggest that MH-positive patients have impaired aerobic metabolism compared to healthy individuals. This could explain the exercise intolerance exhibited in MH-susceptible patient population.
3:::Valproic acid (VPA) decreased LTG clearance by 66% in bitherapy, and by 35% and 31% in triple therapy with carbamazepine (CBZ) and phenytoin (PHT) respectively. CBZ and PHT increased LTG clearance by 52% and 96% in respective bitherapies but by 88% in triple therapy. Clonazepam, levetiracetam, and topiramate had no effect. The LTG therapeutic range (TR) was exceeded in 1% of cases in monotherapy, and in 4-5% of cases in combination therapy. Only 54% of results were within the TR during 2001-2005, while 60-62% were within the TR during 2006-2014. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in 88 cases and occurred more frequently during TR during 2001-2005. Higher number of supratherapeutic levels in combination therapy led to a 3-fold higher incidence of ADR and poorer seizure control, as seizures occurred more often monthly (2.5%) or a few per year (41%) and fewer patients were seizure free (18%). Seizures occurred more often daily and monthly during the first period and in patients with three or four drugs in combination.
2:::In this study, a total of 126 children with LM were randomly divided into an intervention group (administered 0.5% ATE) and a control group (administered a placebo), with 63 children in each group. The outcome measurements were changes in the spherical equivalent (SE), and axial length (AL), as well as adverse events (AEs).
3:::YAP-1 expression was observed in 62.1% of PTC tumors. There were significant positive correlations between YAP-1 expression and tumor size, lymph node metastases, extrathyroidal extension, and tissue infiltration. YAP-1 expression was significantly associated with RFS. Univariate analysis revealed that YAP-1 expression significantly affects RFS. YAP-1 and extrathyroidal extension were significant independent prognosticators for RFS.
4:::YAP-1 expression was significantly correlated with high-risk clinicopathologic features and inferior RFS in patients with PTC.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

2:::Students and parents from elementary and middle schools located in two school districts in South Carolina were enrolled in a prospective cohort study of changes in childrens PA from elementary to middle school. Measures included children's and/or parents' ratings of various psychosocial and socioenvironmental factors as well as objectively measured PA, children's anthropometric characteristics and neighborhood factors at 5(th) and 6(th) grades.'
3:::Very little time or MVPA was recorded in structured contexts. Unstructured outdoor leisure-time was associated with an increase in total daily MVPA almost twice that of unstructured indoor leisure-time (b-value [95% CI]: 8.45 [1.71, 14.48] vs. 4.38 [0.20, 8.22] minute increase per hour spent). The association was stronger for time spent in structured outdoor leisure-time (35.81 [20.60, 52.27]).
4:::Application of fluoride varnish in the clinic setting is unlikely to be cost-effective in low-risk populations. There is the need to either target high-risk groups or to provide fluoride varnish at lower costs, possibly in nonclinic settings.
2:::To investigate how this might occur, we measured the β-oxidation rate of (13) C-labeled C8 and C10 in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells using isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. The effects of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) inhibition, with the CPT1 inhibitor etomoxir, on C8 and C10 β-oxidation were also investigated.
3:::Both fatty acids were catabolized, as judged by (13) CO2 release. However, C10 was β-oxidized at a significantly lower rate, 20% that of C8. This difference was explained by a clear dependence of C10 on CPT1 activity, which is low in neurons, whereas 66% of C8 β-oxidation was independent of CPT1. In addition, C10 β-oxidation was decreased further in the presence of C8.
1:::This study examined the effects of an interaction-focussed therapy for aphasia, which involved both people with aphasia and their familiar conversation partners. It was hypothesised the interaction-focussed therapy would lead to positive changes in targeted conversation behaviours, and improved quality of life for participants with aphasia.
3:::The wound area significantly decreased (P<0.05) in the treated animals. There was a significant increase (P<0.05) in new vessels, fibroblasts count and collagen deposition in the ostrich oil treated animals. Expression of VEGF, TGF-β1 and FGF-2 revealed the immunomodulation and angiogenesis effects of the ostrich oil on wound healing.
4:::Prophylactic administration of NSAIDs reduced the incidence of PEP in both RCTs and C-Cs, especially when rectally administered, but was not effective in reducing the risk of moderate to severe pancreatitis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
2:::Eligible data (gender, depth of invasion, lymphovascular invasion, size, ulceration, macroscopic type and location) were extracted from the included studies and systematically reviewed via a meta-analysis. Review Manager version 5.3 was used to perform the data processing. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was utilized to evaluate the quality of the included articles.
3:::Fourteen studies were included in the final analysis. After meta-analysis, female gender, submucosal invasion, lymphovascular invasion and size >20 mm were associated with LNM in early SRC.
3:::Flap-based procedures produced a 49% (range: 2% to 87%) greater mean reduction in effective stromal collagen fiber stiffness within the flap region than contralateral SMILE cases. Lower stresses and deformations were observed within the residual stromal bed in SMILE cases than in flap-based cases. Stromal bed displacements and stresses were more affected by a loading increase in flap-based eyes than flapless eyes.
4:::Remineralisation occurred regardless of treatment group allocation. However, the addition of Tooth Mousse™ resulted in a significantly increased remineralisation effect, compared to fluoride alone. Tooth Mousse™ may be beneficial for patients undergoing orthodontic treatment who are at high risk of demineralisation.
2:::Patients (≥ 18 years) with ≥1 inpatient or ≥2 outpatient CML diagnoses were identified from the MarketScan Commercial and Medicare databases (January 1, 2007-June 30, 2015). CML patients were grouped into two study cohorts, those with evidence of disease progression to the blast phase and those without. Patients were required to have continuous medical and prescription coverage during a 12-month baseline period, in which demographics and clinical characteristics were evaluated. All-cause healthcare resource utilization and costs were evaluated during the baseline period, and a variable follow-up period, lasting ≥1 day and up to 1 year. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to compare the incremental costs of CML patients with vs without progression.
3:::Residual dizziness was not related to gender, affected side, age, duration of symptoms, recurrence, or the results of the initial ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential test (p > .05). However, residual dizziness was significantly associated with the results of the second ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential test (p = .007).
3:::Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that MAGL was expressed in all 12 melanoma cell lines, but not in normal human epidermal melanocytes. In the immunohistochemical analysis, positive staining for MAGL was noted in 32 of 48 (64.5%) primary lesions, 14 of 17 (82.4%) lymph node metastatic lesions and 7 of 9 (77.8%) skin metastatic lesions. Metastatic tumours had a significantly higher staining intensity (p=0.033 for lymph node, p=0.010 for skin). In the analysis of primary lesions, higher MAGL expression correlated with greater tumour thickness (p=0.015) and the presence of vascular invasion (p=0.017). On further evaluation of MAGL-positive primary lesions staining intensity of MAGL tended to be higher in deeper areas of the tumour mass.
4:::The expression of MAGL in tumour cells reflects the aggressiveness of melanoma cells and may serve as a marker of tumour progression. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
2:::Seven databases were systematically searched. Peer-reviewed and grey literature on CDC between 1998 and 2014 were assessed using an integrative literature review (ILR) framework. Search terms included CDC, self-directed care, direct payments, community aged care, community dwelling and older adults. Full-text copies were assessed against the inclusion criteria.
3:::When comparing values of %VV, agreement between observers improved using the SA method (mean; R = 0.984, ICC = 0.980, LOA = 7.5%) when compared to the basic method (mean; R = 0.863, ICC = 0.873, LOA = 14.2%) nonsignificantly (pR  = 0.25, pICC  = 0.25, and pLOA  = 0.50 respectively). DSC of VV and TLV masks significantly improved (P < 0.01) using the SA method (mean; DSCVV  = 0.973, DSCTLV  = 0.980) when compared to the basic method (mean; DSCVV  = 0.947, DSCTLV  = 0.957). K-means systematically overestimated %VV when compared to both basic (mean overestimation = 5.0%) and SA methods (mean overestimation = 9.7%), and had poor agreement with the other methods (mean ICC; K-means vs. basic = 0.685, K-means vs. SA = 0.740).
2:::Wavefront aberrations were measured while subjects monocularly viewed a monochromatic Maltese cross moving sinusoidally around 2D of accommodative demand with 1D amplitude at 0.2 Hz. The amplitude and phase (delay) of the accommodation response were compared to the actual vergence of the stimulus to obtain gain and temporal phase, calculated from wavefront aberrations recorded over time during experimental trials. The tested conditions were as follows: Correction of all the subjects aberrations except defocus (C); Correction of all the subject's aberrations except defocus and habitual second-order astigmatism (AS); Correction of all the subject's aberrations except defocus and odd higher-order aberrations (HOAs); Correction of all the subject's aberrations except defocus and even HOAs (E); Natural aberrations of the subject's eye, i.e., the adaptive-optics system only corrected the optical system's aberrations (N); Correction of all the subject's aberrations except defocus and fourth-order spherical aberration (SA). The correction was performed at 20 Hz and each condition was repeated six times in randomised order.'
3:::Simulations indicate that focal gain and penetration depth scale with the expanded reflector-lens balloon diameter, with greater achievable performance using perfluorocarbon lens fluid. Simulations of a 50 mm balloon OD, 10 mm transducer outer diameter (OD), 1.5 MHz assembly in water resulted in maximum intensity gain of ~170 (focal dimensions: ~12 mm length x 1.4 mm width) at ~5 cm focal depth and focal gains above 100 between 24-84 mm depths. A smaller (10 mm balloon OD, 4 mm transducer OD, 1.5 MHz) configuration produced a maximum gain of 6 at 9 mm depth. Compared to a conventional applicator with a fixed spherically-focused transducer of 12 mm diameter, focal gain was enhanced at depths beyond 20 mm for assembly configurations with balloon diameters ≥ 20 mm. Hydrophone characterizations of the experimental assembly (31 mm reflector/lens diameter, 4.75 mm transducer radius, 1.7 MHz) illustrated focusing at variable depths between 10-70 mm with a maximum gain of ~60 and demonstrated agreement with theoretical simulations. Biothermal simulations (30 s sonication, 75°C maximum) indicate that investigated applicator assembly configurations, at 30 mm and 50 mm balloon diameters, could create localized ellipsoidal thermal lesions increasing in size from 10-55 mm length x 3-6 mm width in liver tissue as target depth increased from 2-10 cm.
4:::MJOE is feasible without any adverse events in poststroke patients, and it promotes anterior HD during swallowing.
1:::This retrospective study investigates the relationship between cardiac and extra-thoracic sarcoid findings on FDG PET-CT using a 72-hour pretest high-fat, high-protein, and very low-carbohydrate (HFHPVLC) diet.
2:::The questionnaire was developed in three phases. In phase 1, focus group methods and qualitative analysis of verbatim transcripts generated CD-specific items for a prototype instrument to sensitively captured patient concerns. In phase 2, CD patients completed the prototype CDQL. The questionnaire was refined through analysis of data and cognitive interviewing. In phase 3, the final version of the CDQL was answered by Danish respondents. The psychometric properties of the CDQL were assessed, and the HRQoL data were analyzed.
3:::The study was conducted with 29 children. All children had preoperative unilateral IOOA and SOUA. Eleven children (37.9%) had hyperesodeviation in the affected eye, while others (62.1%) had hyperexodeviation. The mean age at surgery was 6.66 ± 1.87 (4-10) years. The mean vertical deviation, exodeviation, and the amount of IOOA were decreased postoperatively (p < 0.001 for all). Among the 29 children, 22 had no residual ipsilateral IOOA, 2 had ipsilateral IOOA, and 5 had ipsilateral inferior oblique underaction (IOUA) at last visit. Three children had contralateral SOUA, IOOA, and hyperdeviation at follow-up visits, one of whom had IOUA on the operated eye. There was no difference of preoperative features between children with or without subsequent contralateral superior oblique palsy.
3:::The data were accurately described by a one-compartment model. The population mean estimates for oral bioavailability, clearance and volume of distribution for an average patient were 0.86 (IIV 55%), 29.3 L/h (IIV 43%) and 1260 L (IIV 70%), respectively. This resulted in an average terminal half-life of haloperidol of around 30 h.
2:::Two different orthogonal approaches have been used to establish the relationship. First approach uses CL values estimated by non-compartmental analysis (NCA) to establish a correlation with protein size. The second approach simultaneously characterizes the PK data for all the proteins using a 2-compartment model to establish a relationship between protein size and pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters.
4:::Higher prediagnosis circulating IGF-II and IGFBP-3 levels are associated with better pancreatic cancer survival among men but not women. A greater understanding of how IGF signaling is related to pancreatic cancer survival could have utility in improving pancreatic cancer prognosis.
3:::Providers described patient-, provider-, and system-level barriers and facilitators to AET-related SM. At the patient-level, barriers included competing demands, limited time/resources, and possible misattribution of some symptoms to AET, while family/social relationships and insurance emerged as important facilitators. Discomfort with SM, limited time, and challenges distinguishing AET-related symptoms from other conditions were key provider-level barriers. Provider-level facilitators included routine symptom documentation and strong provider relationships. Care fragmentation and complexity of the cancer care delivery system were described as system-level barriers; however, survivor clinics were endorsed by providers.
2:::Postmenopausal women (n = 133,875) aged 50-79 years were followed up for a mean of 14 years. Benign breast disease was defined by history of biopsy. Incident thyroid cancer cases were confirmed by medical record review. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to estimate hazard ratios.
1:::Increased retropatellar pressure and altered kinematics are associated with anterior knee pain and unsatisfied patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Since malposition of the implant is believed to contribute to postoperative pain, we performed this in vitro study to evaluate the influence of mediolateral femoral component position on retropatellar pressure as well as tibio-femoral and patella kinematics.
3:::Traumatic dental injuries exhibited a negative impact on parents QoL, as shown by the total T-FIS score and subscales (p < 0.001). In this study, the determined values for parental emotions > parental/family activity > financial burden > family conflict had a negative impact on the parents' QoL. Parental emotional values were statistically different from those of parental/family activity, financial burden and family conflict values (p < 0.001).'
4:::Each urodynamic criterion for men does not coincide with each other in the diagnosis of DU within individual subjects. On the other hand, PdetQmax 30 criteria and BVE criteria for women could be appropriately applied to clinical practice when diagnosing DU in women with LUTS.
3:::The 2014 and 2015 3-month prevalence of eating disorders were: anorexia nervosa-broad 0.4% (95% CI 0.2-0.7) and 0.5% (0.3-0.9); bulimia nervosa 1.1% (0.7-1.5) and 1.2% (0.9-1.7); ARFID 0.3% (0.1-0.5) and 0.3% (0.2-0.6). The 2015 3-month prevalence rates were: BED-broad 1.5% (1.1-2.0); Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED) 3.2 (2.6-3.9); and Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder (UFED) 10.4% (0.9-11.5). Most people with OSFED had atypical anorexia nervosa and majority with UFED were characterised by having recurrent binge eating without marked distress. Eating disorders were represented throughout sociodemographic groups and those with bulimia nervosa and BED-broad had mean weight (BMI, kg/m(2)) in the obese range. Mental HRQoL was poor in all eating disorder groups but particularly poor for those with BED-broad and ARFID. Individuals with bulimia nervosa, BED-broad and OSFED-Purging Disorder also had poor physical HRQoL. ARFID and bulimia nervosa groups had lower role performance than those without an eating disorder.
2:::Airborne PM was collected each day from January 26, 2015 to February 27, 2015. Daily levels of outdoor fungi-associated PM were calculated using a culture-based method. Production of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was assessed in THP1 cells stimulated by the collected airborne PM each day.
3:::Decontamination factor is calculated after five cleaning for each group. A total of 160 samples result calculated using four decontaminating agent (tap water, SW, Radiacwash, and spirit), four swipe material (cotton, TP, WP, and AS) for commonly used surface (stainless steel, PVC, Perspex, resin) using direct method by 10 samples (n = 10) for each group.
4:::Tap water is the best decontaminating agent compared with SW, Radiac wash and spirit for the laboratory simulated stainless steel, PVC, and Perspex surface material, whereas in case of resin surface material, SW decontaminating agent is showing better effectiveness. Cotton is the best swipe material compared to WP-1, AS and TP for the stainless steel, PVC, Perspex, and resin laboratory simulated surface materials. Perspex and stainless steel are the most suitable and recommended laboratory surface material compared to PVC and resin in nuclear medicine. Radiacwash may show better result for 99mTc labelled product and other radionuclide contamination on the laboratory working surface area.
2:::We measured visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) volumes and intrahepatic lipid (IHL) content by MRI, and whole body glucose disposal (WBGD) and MVR (using contrast-enhanced ultrasound) responses to a euglycemic insulin clamp in lean (n = 25) and abdominally obese men (n = 52). Abdominally obese men were randomized to dietary weight loss intervention or habitual diet.
3:::In the stability analysis, we observed that temperature and humidity had an overall limited influence on the miRNomes (average correlation between the different conditions of 0.993). Usage of a silica gel slightly diminished DBS technical reproducibility. The 7 technical replicates had an average correlation of 0.996. The correlation with whole-blood PAXGene miRNomes of the same individual was remarkable (correlation of 0.88). Finally, evaluation of the samples from the 53 patients with lung cancer exposed to different therapies showed that the biological variations exceeded the technical variability significantly (P < 0.0001), yielding 51 dysregulated miRNAs.'
2:::We investigated the relationship between sleep quality and CSF AD biomarkers in a cohort enriched for parental history of sporadic AD, the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimers Prevention. A total of 101 participants (mean age 62.9 ± 6.2 years, 65.3% female) completed sleep assessments and CSF collection and were cognitively normal. Sleep quality was measured with the Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale. CSF was assayed for biomarkers of amyloid metabolism and plaques (β-amyloid 42 [Aβ42]), tau pathology (phosphorylated tau [p-tau] 181), neuronal/axonal degeneration (total tau [t-tau], neurofilament light [NFL]), neuroinflammation/astroglial activation (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1], chitinase-3-like protein 1 [YKL-40]), and synaptic dysfunction/degeneration (neurogranin). To adjust for individual differences in total amyloid production, Aβ42 was expressed relative to Aβ40. To assess cumulative pathology, CSF biomarkers were expressed in ratio to Aβ42. Relationships among sleep scores and CSF biomarkers were assessed with multiple regression, controlling for age, sex, time between sleep and CSF measurements, and CSF assay batch.'
4:::Self-report of poor sleep was associated with greater AD-related pathology in cognitively healthy adults at risk for AD. Effective strategies exist for improving sleep; therefore sleep health may be a tractable target for early intervention to attenuate AD pathogenesis.
3:::The review is in progress. We plan to submit the results in the beginning of 2018.
2:::The retrospective study included patients who had undergone injection laryngoplasty as day cases between July 2013 and March 2016. Cost data were obtained, along with patient demographics, anaesthetic details, type of injectant, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, length of stay, total operating theatre time and surgeon procedure time.
3:::Fifty percent had no depression, 15.6% had a minor depression and 34.4% were suffering from major depression. Difficulty with concentration is the symptom that differentiated the last two groups the most. Fatigue, depressed mood and anhedonia were the symptoms that distinguished participants with minor depression the most from participants with no depression. Main limitations are: The sample was determined by programme conditions, e.g. not all potentially available people participated. The sample may therefore not be representative for the general long-term unemployed. Due to limited resources the PHQ 9 was used instead of a clinical interview to assess minor and major depression.
4:::Results indicate that minor depression in older, long-term unemployed persons is significant, as, almost 16% of the participants were affected in the study. Especially when fatigue is present for a period of more than 2 weeks, people should be informed about the option to consult a primary care physician or professionals from the unemployment agency in order to prevent the possible onset of major depression.
2:::We prospectively collected clinical S. aureus isolates from the patients <19 years of age in a university-affiliated hospital in 2012. Only first isolate from each patient was included. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed and the patients were classified as CA or healthcare-associated (HA) by the standard epidemiologic criteria. Isolates as CA-MRSA were further characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec) typing, and multilocus sequence typing.
3:::Participants were 59% male and 91% Black, and had a median age of 13.5 (range 12-18) years. Participants with ≥4 hospitalizations over 1-year prior (using electronic medical chart review) reported more negative perceptions of SCD-related symptoms and emotional response, and perceived hydroxyurea as less beneficial; all p-values ≤0.01. Most participants (74%) reported low hydroxyurea adherence. Participants with higher hydroxyurea adherence perceived more hydroxyurea benefits (r s = 0.44, p < 0.01) and had better emotional response to SCD (r s = -0.44, p = 0.01). In a sub-analysis of HbSS patients, perceived benefits of hydroxyurea positively correlated with HbF (r s = 0.37, p = 0.05) and MCV values (r s = 0.35, p = 0.05). Participants with more negative perceptions of SCD-related consequences, concerns, and emotional response, and fewer perceived hydroxyurea benefits reported worse fatigue (r s = 0.68; r s = 0.44; r s = 0.74; r s = -0.60), pain (r s = 0.56; r s = 0.54; r s = 0.63; r s = -0.39), anxiety (r s = 0.55; r s = 0.58; r s = 0.56; r s = -0.47), and depression (r s = 0.64; r s = 0.49; r s = 0.70; r s = -0.62), respectively, all p-values <0.05.
4:::Dynamics influencing hydroxyurea adherence are multifactorial, and understanding patients perceptions is critical to overcoming adherence barriers. Patients' favorable perceptions correlated with greater adherence and better HRQOL domain scores. Prospective evaluation of patients' perceptions of SCD and hydroxyurea in relation adherence, HRQOL domains and clinical outcomes is warranted.'
2:::We will conduct a systematic search for all N-of-1 trial guidelines and protocol-reporting guidelines published in peer-reviewed literature. We will search Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Methodology Register, CENTRAL, and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database. Eligible articles will contain explicit guidance on N-of-1 protocol construction or reporting. Two reviewers will independently screen all titles and abstracts and then undertake full-text reviews of potential articles to determine eligibility. One reviewer will perform data extraction of selected articles, checked by the second reviewer. Data analysis will ascertain common features of N-of-1 trial protocols and compare them to the SPIRIT and CENT items.
3:::Analysis of multiple viewpoints reveal that with appropriate training and support it is possible to change TBAs practices so they support pregnant women in new ways (support and referral rather than delivery). Participants perceived that trained TBAs can utilize their embedded and trusted community relationships to interact effectively with their communities, help overcome barriers to acceptability, utilization and contribute to effective demand for maternal and newborn services and ultimately enhance utilization of skilled birth attendants. Trained TBAs appreciated cordial relationship at the health centres and feeling as part of the health system. Key challenges that emerged included the distance women needed to travel to reach health centers, appropriate remuneration of trained TBAs and strategies to sustain their work.
4:::Taken together, MRS is frequently overexpressed in NSCLC. Moreover, MRS is related to mTORC1 activity and its overexpression is associated with poor clinical outcomes, indicating that it has potential as a putative therapeutic target.
2:::Methylome datasets (GSE52865, GSE20713, GSE69914), available through Omnibus, were used to determine whether ALKBH2 or ALKBH3 are found inactivated by CpG promoter methylation. TCGA dataset enabled us to then assess the impact of CpG promoter methylation on mRNA expression for both ALKBH2 and ALKBH3. DNA methylation analysis for the ALKBH3 promoter region was carried out by pyrosequencing (PyroMark Q24) in 265 primary breast tumours and 30 proximal normal breast tissue samples along with 8 breast-derived cell lines. ALKBH3 mRNA and protein expression were analysed in cell lines using RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. DNA alkylation damage assay was carried out in cell lines based on immunofluorescence and confocal imaging. Data on clinical parameters and survival outcomes in patients were obtained and assessed in relation to ALKBH3 promoter methylation.
3:::Among the patients who received CRT+HT, a higher CEM43T90 (≥1 min) value (a thermal dose parameter) was significantly associated with better local relapse-free survival in both univariate (p = 0.024) and multivariate (p = 0.0097) analyses. The disease-free survival of the patients with higher CEM43T90 (≥1 min) values tended to be better in comparison to patients with lower CEM43T90 (<1 min) value (p = 0.071). A complete response tended to be associated with the CEM43T90 (p = 0.056). Disease-free survival, local relapse-free survival, and complete response rate for patients with higher CEM43T90 (≥1) were significantly better than those for patients with CRT alone (p = 0.036, p = 0.036 and p = 0.048).
2:::Consecutive non-active IBD outpatients were asked to fill in the self-reported Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) and the Beliefs about Medication Questionnaire (BMQ). Pharmacy refill data were reviewed from the previous three or six months and the medication possession ratio (MPR) was calculated. Non-adherence was defined as MMAS-8 scores < 6 or MPR < 0.8.
3:::The requirement of intraoperative additional doses of LA was significantly lower in the Case Group (median LA volume administered by the surgeon: 13.8 ± 5.6 ml vs 20.7 ± 9.1 ml, p<0.05). Two patients in the Control Group needed systemic sedation. VAS scores at 15mins, 30 mins, 1h, 2h, pre-discharge, 24h were significantly lower in the Case Group (p<0.005). Four cases of femoral nerve block were reported, 3 in the Control Group, 1 in the Case Group (2.2% vs 7.7%, p>0.05).
4:::The combination of GFN block and II/IHN block is associated with lower postoperative VAS scores and lower doses of intraoperative additional LA.
1:::To report the results of a selective localized tenonplasty procedure based on findings of ocular surface fluorescein angiography (FA).
3:::There were 412 at-risk offspring (202 [49.0%] female), with a mean (SD) visit age of 12.0 (3.5) years and a mean (SD) age at new-onset BPSD of 14.2 (4.5) years. Among them, 54 (13.1%) developed BPSD during follow-up (18 with BD I or II); these participants contributed a total of 1058 visits, 67 (6.3%) of which preceded new-onset BPSD within the next 5 years. Using internal validation to account for overfitting, the model provided good discrimination between converting vs nonconverting visits (AUC, 0.76; bootstrapped 95% CI, 0.71-0.82). Important univariate predictors of outcome (AUC range, 0.66-0.70) were dimensional measures of mania, depression, anxiety, and mood lability; psychosocial functioning; and parental age at mood disorder.
2:::We developed a structured questionnaire to collect demographics from postpartum patients and measure use of technology and the internet, self-reported literacy, interest in health information, awareness of portal functions, and perceived barriers to use. The questionnaire was administered in person to women in an inpatient setting.
4:::This study proposes a reliable new experimental model for a better understanding of tuberculosis in sheep. BCG vaccination offers an effective prospect for controlling the disease. Moreover alternative doses and/or routes of administration should be considered to evaluate the efficacy of the HIMB vaccine candidate.
3:::Enhanced AQP2 expression revealed that Ec increased water transporter expression, decreased by Li diet, but the expression of the tubular transporters did not change. The Ec, Ec+NAC and Allo+Ec results showed that Ec increased TBARS and decreased GSH, showing evidence of ROS occurrence, which was protected by NAC and Allo. Rhabdomyolysis was only protected by Allo.
2:::231 suspected cases of SFTS were reported by various medical institutions from 2011 to 2013 in Jiangsu Province, China. They were followed with SFTSV diagnosis tests and interview-administered questionnaires about demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms and epidemiological exposure factors. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to examine the diagnostic value of these parameters.
3:::The CPPS group (n = 26) and the control group (n = 28) showed no statistical differences between males and females for age and body mass index (Mann-Whitney U test). The patients in the CPPS group were significantly older and had a significantly higher weight compared to controls. Healthy volunteers did not show any pain area or mechanosensitivity of the examined peripheral nerves of the lumbosacral plexus. Patients with CPPS showed a variety of pain from different musculoskeletal origins. Neurodynamic testing demonstrated significant mechanosensitivity in at least one nerve of the lumbosacral plexus in 88% of the patients with CPPS, suggesting minor nerve injuries. Pudendal nerve mechanosensitivity was found in 85% of patients, while 42% had multiple nerves involved. Unilateral or bilateral pudendal channel palpatory pain was present in 62% of the CPPS group and not in controls.
4:::Modern (≥2000 MY) design seats have lower biomechanical responses in 40.2 km/h rear sled tests than older (<2000 MY) designs and ABTS designs. The improved performance is consistent with an increase in seat strength combined with improved occupant kinematics through pocketing of the occupant into the seatback, higher and more forward head restraint and other design changes. The methods and data presented here provide a basis for standardized testing of seats. However, a complete understanding of seat safety requires consideration of out of position occupants (OOP) in high-speed impacts and consideration of the much more common, low-speed rear impacts.
3:::Mean lesion size ± SD was 20 ± 16 mm (range, 6-96 mm) and mean distance to skin on CT was 62 ± 25 mm (range, 18-125 mm). In all, 89.7% (96/107) of the lesions were visible on US, including all lesions that were 15 mm or larger. Nonvisible lesions were smaller than visible ones (10.0 ± 3.6 mm vs 20.7 ± 16.3 mm, p = 0.03) regardless of location (p > 0.05). CT overestimated lesion distance to skin compared with US (46.6 ± 18.6 mm, p < 0.001). Final diagnoses for US visible lesions (n = 96) were hyperattenuating cyst (n = 66), Bosniak IIF cyst (n = 13), and cystic or solid neoplasm (n = 15); two patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 66 hyperattenuating cysts, 54 (81.8%) appeared as simple cysts on US with sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of hyperattenuating cyst of 81.8% (95% CI, 75.6-84.3%) and 92.9% (95% CI, 78.1-98.7%), respectively. The other 12 (18.2%) hyperattenuating cysts appeared complex. Two of the 13 Bosniak IIF lesions were incorrectly classified as simple cysts with US. Including the 11 (10%) nonvisible lesions reduced sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of hyperattenuating cyst to 73.0% (95% CI, 66.9-75.9%) and 89.7% (95% CI, 74.2-97.2%), respectively.
2:::Participating patients (n = 40) received either placebo (n = 20) or cysteamine cream (n = 20) in a double-blind placebo controlled study. Cysteamine cream or placebo was applied on the lesions once a day at bedtime throughout the four-month study period. Treatment efficacy was determined through Dermacatch(®) and Mexameter(®) skin colorimetry, MASI scores, Investigator Global Assessments (IGAs), and patient questionnaires, all performed at baseline, 2-month, and 4-month examinations.
3:::For 119 of 122 patients, eMRI was available, and 111 had subsequent MRI for comparison. Thirty-six (30%) had an early radiological response, and 17 (14%) had progressive disease. The concordance between eMRI and 8-week MRI was moderate (κ = 0.56), with most providing the same result (n = 79 [71%]). There was strong evidence that progression-free survival and overall survival were predicted by the eMRI response (both P values < .001). The median survival was 8.6 months for an eMRI response, 6.6 months for stable disease, and 3.7 months for progressive disease; the hazard ratio (progressive disease vs stable disease) was 3.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.9-6.0). Landmark analyses showed that eMRI progression was a strong predictor of mortality independent of other potential baseline predictors.

2:::A focused 20-item questionnaire was designed to survey the public awareness and knowledge of ASD. Personal interviews were conducted during an ASD awareness day, which was organized in a major shopping mall on February 20, 2015 in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
3:::CIAKI was observed in 69 patients (7%). Chronic kidney disease [relative risk (RR) = 4, P < 0.01], reduced ejection fraction (RR = 2.88, P < 0.01), CIAKI risk score at least 4 (RR = 2.64, P = 0.02), and emergency coronary angiography/PCI (RR = 3.87, P < 0.01) increased CIAKI risk, whereas statins were protective (RR = 0.32, P < 0.01).Patients with CIAKI had higher rates of 8-year cardiovascular adverse events: 54 versus 15% MACCE (RR = 6.67, P < 0.01), 38 versus 4% CVD (RR = 15.73, P < 0.01). Among other factors, CIAKI was the strongest predictor of 8-year MACCE (RR = 3.16, P < 0.01) and CVD (RR = 7.34, P < 0.01).During the follow-up, glomerular filtration rate declined drastically in CIAKI patients: 70 versus 39% had chronic kidney disease stage worsening (P < 0.01) and 8 versus 0.3% started hemodialysis (P < 0.01).
2:::The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) database from the New York State Department of Health was used to identify 377,705 patients who had undergone primary TKA in the period from 1997 to 2014. Preoperative diagnoses, comorbidities, and postoperative complications were determined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Readmission was defined as all-cause, due to complications considered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to be TKA-specific, or due to an expanded list of TKA-specific complications based on expert opinion. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was utilized to determine the independent predictors of readmission within 30 days after surgery.
3:::Mean age was 56 years, 55% were men, 87% had degenerative conditions, 40% had a positive depression screen, 62% had anxiety greater than population norms, and 77% reported as much social support as wanted. Variables that remained associated with a LOS > 3 days (53%) in multivariable analysis were: older age (OR 1.8, CI 1.2-2.8); female gender (OR 1.9, CI 1.2-2.9), less social support (OR1.4, CI 1.1-1.7); obesity (OR1.8, CI 1.1-2.8), worse functional status (OR 1.0, CI 1.0-1.0) and more invasive surgery (OR 3.0, CI 2.4-3.7). Variables that remained associated with discharged with external services (17%) in multivariable analysis were: older age (OR 3.3, CI 1.9-5.9); less social support (OR 1.3, CI 1.0-1.7); positive depression screen (OR 1.9, CI 1.1-3.4); more anxiety (OR 2.4, CI 1.3-4.2); major comorbidity (OR 1.7, CI 1.0-2.8); and more invasive surgery (OR 1.9, CI 1.5-2.5).
4:::This study confirms the importance of demographic/clinical variables as predictors of greater RU after lumbar surgery and provides preliminary evidence for the importance of concurrent psychosocial variables, particularly less social support and worse psychological well-being.
3:::Of 1048 interns, 870 completed the initial survey (response rate 83%), 836 of which had linkage data (96%). Also, 672 residents had evidence of completion of residency (noncompletion rate 20%). On Classification and Regression Tree analysis, sex was the independent factor most strongly associated with attrition. The lowest noncompletion rate for men was among interns at small community programs who were White, non-Hispanic, and married (6%). The lowest noncompletion rate for women was among interns training at smaller academic programs (11%).
2:::Forty-six MNP and fifty-one WAD patients underwent a physical examination consisting of cervical range of motion, PPTs in the upper trapezius and tibialis anterior muscles, TrPs examination in the upper trapezius, and collection of clinical data including disability, pain intensity and spontaneous symptomatic pain area.
4:::Findings support assertion that nurse leaders are integral in enhancing PPEs and their influence links structures necessary for an environment that supports outcomes.
3:::There were 43 cyclists who achieved a T10 placing for the first time between 2010 and 2015, with an average number of UCI points of 139.7 ±77.1 points. Of these cyclists, 20 placed within the top five (T5), and averaged 183.1 ±71.6 UCI points within the T5 season. There was a significant difference in the number of points accumulated in the T5/T10 between the T5 and T10 groups (p<0.05), however there were no significant differences between the groups in the other seasons.
2:::A mixed-methods study consisting of focus groups and a cross-sectional survey was conducted with teens from two public high schools.
3:::The prevalences of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ischaemic heart disease, stroke and metabolic syndrome were significantly higher among subjects with low-teen OAG compared with normal subjects, while only the prevalences of hypertension and stroke were higher among subjects with high-teen OAG compared with normal subjects. In multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for confounding factors, low-teen OAG was significantly associated with hypertension (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.30-2.18), hyperlipidemia (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.07-2.08), ischaemic heart disease (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.07-3.11), stroke (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.12-3.25) and metabolic syndrome (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.12-1.90). High-teen OAG was only associated with stroke (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 1.20-5.53).
1:::We investigated the surgical results of macular hole retinal detachment (MHRD) with a modified C-shaped temporal inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap to reconstruct the foveolar architecture in highly myopic eyes.
2:::Radiation response was studied in a wide range of cancer cell lines and normal cells using colony formation assays. The effect on cell cycle progression was assessed and the relationship between TOPK expression and therapeutic efficacy was studied in a cohort of 128 prostate cancer patients treated with radical radiotherapy.
4:::This study demonstrates that TOPK disruption may cause tumour-specific radiosensitisation in multiple different tumour types.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 4 July 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2017.197 www.bjcancer.com.
3:::Mechanisms of drug incorporation have not yet been fully elucidated. However, some research has lately contributed to a better understanding of how substances are incorporated into nails, suggesting three potential mechanisms of drug incorporation: contamination from sweat, incorporation from nail bed and incorporation from germinal matrix. In addition, numerous methods dealing with the determination of drugs of abuse, medications and alcohol biomarkers in nails have been reported in studies over the years. The latter methods could find application in clinical and forensic toxicology.
2:::A nationwide, cross-sectional study was performed in September 2015. A stratified random sample of 50,000 participants was selected from children and adolescents aged 6-7 years (n=17,500), 9-10 years (n=17,500), 12-13 years (n=7,500), and 15-16 years (n=7,500). Parents were asked to complete a questionnaire on the detailed history of immediate-type FA.
3:::The Person-Centred Situational Leadership Framework captures seven core attributes of the leader that facilitates person-centredness in others: - relating with the essence of being; harmonising actions with the vision; balancing concern for compliance with concern for person-centredness; connecting with the other person in the instant; intentionally enthusing the other person to act; listening to the other person with the heart and unifying through collaboration, appreciation and trust.
4:::The observed connection between ADHD and criminality may be better understood through their shared relationships with indicators of poor social bonds. These include antisocial behaviour more generally, but also drug use and failure to progress to any form of tertiary education, including vocational training. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
3:::Physicians and nurses evaluated three similar factors and four differing factors when deciding to invite family presence during resuscitation. Furthermore, nurses and physicians weighed the factors differently. Physicians weighed most heavily the familys potential to disrupt life-saving efforts and compromise patient care and then the family's knowledge about resuscitations. Nurses heavily weighed the potential for family to be traumatized, the potential for the family to disrupt the resuscitation, and possible family benefit.'
2:::A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data for all women who underwent manual removal of the placenta after vaginal delivery at a tertiary medical center in Jerusalem, Israel, between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2015. The study group comprised women who had not received prophylactic antibiotic treatment, whereas the control group comprised women who had received prophylactic antibiotic treatment. The primary outcome measure was the frequency of postpartum endometritis.
3:::The retention rate and the effective half-time of mLN were lower than that of ThyR (p < 0.001, p = 0.003). In addition, the retention rate and the effective half-time of ThyR in the rhTSH group were higher than those in the THW group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001). The differences in the retention rate and the effective half-time of mLN were not statistically significant between the THW group and rhTSH group (p = 0.549, p = 0.571).
2:::A consecutive series of patients who underwent a contrast-enhanced chest CT scan were included. Images were acquired on a novel dual-layer spectral CT system. Conventional reconstructions as well as VNC and mono-energetic images at different keV levels were used for nodule volumetry.
4:::Novel dual-layer spectral CT offers the possibility to reconstruct VNC and mono-energetic images. Those reconstructions show that higher pulmonary nodule attenuation results in larger nodule volumes. This may explain the reported underestimation in nodule volume on non-contrast enhanced compared to contrast-enhanced acquisitions.
3:::High leptin and leptin/adiponectin ratio levels were significantly associated with lower percentage MD and higher absolute and non-absolute dense tissue areas. High adiponectin levels were significantly associated with lower absolute dense and non-dense tissue areas, but not with percentage MD. After adjustment for BMI, only the associations between percentage MD and absolute non-dense tissue area with leptin remained statistically significant.
1:::According to the ""fundamental cause theory"", emerging knowledge on health-enhancing behaviours and technologies results in persisting and even widening health disparities, favouring the higher socioeconomic groups. This study aims to assess (trends in) socioeconomic inequalities in site-specific cancer mortality in Belgian women.
2:::453 patients with neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment intention were recruited into the MaTox project within the prospective, multicentre, population-based German TMK cohort study (Tumour Registry Breast Cancer) between 2008 and 2009. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) on 26 treatment-related symptoms were assessed via a specifically designed questionnaire at 4 weeks, 6 months, 18 months and 3 years after start of systemic treatment.
3:::A significant and maintained clinical improvement of all clinical outcome scores was observed after a mean FU of 10.2 years (VASarm 6.3-2.1; VASneck 6.4-1.9; NDI 21-6; p < 0.05). An increase in the incidence and the extent of heterotopic ossifications was noted during the post-operative course with a significant influence on the function of the prosthesis, which, however, did not reveal any detrimental effect on the patients clinical symptomatology. Prosthesis mobility declined from 9.0° preoperatively and 9.1° at 1 year FU to 7.7° and 7.6° at the five- and ten-year FU examinations, respectively. Radiological signs of adjacent segment degeneration were detected in 13/38 (35.7%), however, in only 3/38 (7.9%) patients this radiological changes were associated with clinical symptoms requiring conservative treatment. Intraoperative technical failure in two cases required interbody fusion with a cage (2/50). One patient (1/48, 2.1%) treated this motion device had revision surgery at the index level.'
4:::Frequency of OHSS due to a gonadotroph adenoma is not negligible. Increased awareness of the characteristic clinical and hormonal picture should permit an early detection of this condition in premenopausal women with a pituitary adenoma.
1:::Disability acquisition in adulthood is associated with deterioration in mental health. Social support may act as a ""buffer"" against poor mental health following disability acquisition. We tested the hypothesis that women and men with low social support experienced larger declines in mental health on acquisition of a disability compared to women and men with high social support.
2:::We assessed whether social support, measured both prior and subsequent to disability acquisition, modified the association between disability acquisition and mental health using 14 annual waves of data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. Participants reported at least two consecutive waves of disability preceded by at least two consecutive waves without disability (2200 participants, 15,724 observations). Fixed-effects linear regression models were used to estimate average differences in mental health between waves with and without disability, for women and men separately. We tested for effect measure modification of the association by social support, including a three-way interaction between disability and social support prior and subsequent to disability acquisition.
3:::There is a significant increase in block reclaims during the period analyzed among submissions for consultation as well as in clinical trials (linear regression, p = 0.0195 and p = 0.0107). The percentage of block reclaims does not differ between consultations and cases submitted upon request within clinical trials (p = 0.2404, t-test). A survey among pathologies that reclaim the block showed that their willingness to leave the block at the reference center would increase if the compatibility with accreditation guidelines (39.3%), a positive statement from professional associations (25%), or a formal confirmation of availability (53.6%) is provided.
3:::Mean age at the moment of starting PD was 14.9 ± 9.3 days. Mean body weight (BW) was 825 ± 215 g. The average gestational age was 26.3 ± 1.1 weeks. The average duration of dialysis was 20.5 ± 14.7 h. The average ultrafiltration was 7.7 ± 4.2 mL/kg/h. At the moment of starting PD, the average BW was 302 ± 317g (22 ± 13%), higher than at birth (in patients who had PD started in first 2 weeks of their lives) or higher than the BW before AKI was diagnosed (patients who had PD started when they were older than 2 weeks). The main cause of AKI was sepsis (n = 8/10). Dialysate leak was registered in 2 patients, 1 patient had peritonitis and the other had a blocked PD catheter. Six patients died during PD (severe sepsis), 1 died due to hypoxic encephalopathy and coma, and 2 patients survived. One patient (with hypoxic encephalopathy and coma) died 10 days after PD was stopped due to sepsis. The overall mortality was 80%.
2:::Hospital interpreters from five Melbourne metropolitan health services were recruited for in-depth semi-structured interviews that explored the question, What can be learnt from hospital interpreters about cultural issues related to ACP and end-of-life decision-making?' Thirty-nine interpreters, representing 22 language groups, were interviewed. Analysis of the transcribed interviews used qualitative description.'
4:::The most centralized and strongly connected dispensaries in both cities had newer accounts, higher daily activity, more frequent user engagement, and increased usage of embedded media, keywords, and hyperlinks. Measures derived from both network structure and cyberbehavioral dimensions can serve as key contextual indicators for the online surveillance of cannabis dispensaries and consumer markets over time.
3:::A total of 120 participants were randomized to view either the original or the modified version of the advertisement. Regarding the comprehension and retention of only the benefit information, no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups. Significant differences were observed for comprehension and retention of only the risk information. The experimental group had significantly higher scores in comprehension (U = 1224; P < 0.01) and retention (U = 965; P < 0.01) of the risk information compared with the control group. These differences were also significant in multivariate analyses controlling for extraneous variables that were found to have associations with comprehension and retention of information.
2:::German claims data from more than ten million adults were used to calculate annual incidence rates of herpes zoster for the years 2006-2012 and to analyse the prevalence of complications, physician visits, hospitalisations, and antiviral and analgesic treatments using a cohort design. The analyses were stratified by age, sex, and severity of immunosuppression, defined by immunocompromising conditions and drug therapies.
4:::Our findings suggest that hepatectomy after down-staging by 3D-CRT for PVTT combined with HAIC for advanced HCC is safe and results in good long term outcome.
3:::Convenient expressions for D50,i and γ50,i were provided for the Poisson and the logistic model. Comparable TCP estimates were obtained for photon and proton plans of the 45 patients using the sub-volume model, despite notably higher dose levels (on average +4.9%) in the low-risk CTVE for photon irradiation. In contrast, assuming a homogeneous dose response in the entire target volume resulted in TCP estimates contradicting clinical experience (the highest failure rate in the low-risk CTVE) and differing substantially between photon and proton irradiation.
2:::We analyzed clinical data and mapped BAMNs anatomically. We also reviewed the histopathologic features of BAMNs and compared these between adults and children.
3:::A review of the literature identified two predominant factors related to frequent users in the emergency department: a lack of awareness of medical necessity and issues of access.
4:::A patient-centered foodservice model, such as room service, can improve patient nutritional intake and enhance patient satisfaction in a budget constrained health care environment.
3:::Endogenous DDR2 protein expression levels were high in one cell line, PC-1, and immunohistochemistry of lung cancer tissue array showed high levels of DDR2 protein in 29% of lung SQCC patients. A mutation (T681I) identified in lung SQCC and the cell line EBC-1 was detected among 44 primary lung SQCC samples and 7 lung SQCC cell lines. Although Forced expression of DDR2 and its mutant (T681I) led to induce SQCC cell invasion in vitro, only wild type DDR2 enhanced lung metastasis in an animal model. We also found that ectopic expression of DDR2 induced MMP-1 mRNA expression accompanied by phosphorylation of c-Jun after treatment with its ligand, collagen type I, but DDR2 with the T681I mutation did not, suggesting that T681I mutation is an inactivating mutation.
1:::The goal of this study was to validate the cigar box arthroscopy trainer (CBAT) as a training tool and then compare its effectiveness to didactic training and to another previously validated low-fidelity but anatomic model, the anatomic knee arthroscopy trainer (AKAT).
2:::A nonanatomic knee arthroscopy training module was developed at our institution. Twenty-four medical students with no prior arthroscopic or laparoscopic experience were enrolled as subjects. Eight subjects served as controls. The remaining 16 subjects were randomized to participate in 4 hours of either the CBAT or a previously validated AKAT. Subjects skills were assessed by 1 of 2 faculty members through repeated attempts at performing a diagnostic knee arthroscopy on a cadaveric specimen. Objective scores were given using a minimally adapted version of the Basic Arthroscopic Knee Skill Scoring System. Total cost differences were calculated.'
3:::Countries with high rates of fertility and/or HIV need more SRMNAH workers (e.g. Malawi and Zambia each need 44 per 10,000 women of reproductive age, compared with 20-27 in the other four countries). All six countries need between 1.7 and 1.9 midwives per 175 births, i.e. more than the established 1 per 175 births benchmark.
4:::The prevalence of MetS was high for a healthy population highlighting the fact that one can be physically healthy but have metabolic derangements indicative of an increased CVD risk. This is likely to result in an increase in the cases of CVD and type 2 diabetes in Kenya if interventions are not put in place to reverse this trend. We have also demonstrated the inappropriateness of the WC cut-off of 80 cm for black African women in Kenya when defining MetS and recommend adoption of 86 cm.
2:::Groups of adult female mosquitoes (n = 10 per replicate) reared from larvae of a local population, identified as predominantly (95%) Anopheles arabiensis, were released in the hut. An infrared video tracking system recorded flight and net contact activity over 1 h as the mosquitoes attempted to reach a supine human volunteer within a bed net (either a deltamethrin-treated LLIN or an untreated control net). A range of activities, including flight path, position in relation to the bed net and duration of net contact, were quantified and compared between treatments.
3:::Despite an overall declining trend, teenage women show a rising proportion of pregnancies that end in an elective termination (56% to 67%, 1995 to 2009). Non-Western immigrant women also show a slight increase in incidence. Heightened economic disadvantage among non-Western immigrant women does not account for this rise. Elective abortions also show a sustained ""summer peak"" in June, July and August. Low-income women show the most pronounced summer peak.
4:::A PK/PD model illustrates that the relationship between mitiglinide concentration in plasma and glucose lowering effect in healthy volunteers was established. The results of our experiment suggested that the model can be used reasonably to predict the relationship between PK and PD in mitiglinide, which could be used in diabetes mellitus dosage control in clinical trials and other fields.
2:::A retrospective study (n = 339) and a prospective study (n = 340) were performed. MRD was determined using multiparameter flow cytometry.
3:::One hundred young people with narcolepsy and 95 control subjects returned questionnaires. The factor structure revealed two main factors with five domains and 21 questions, which was confirmed with confirmatory factor analysis. The domains of the NARQoL-21 showed good independence while the floor and ceiling effects were acceptable. The external reliability (0.928), convergent validity (rs = 0.769) and internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha = 0.886) were excellent. A Bland-Altman plot revealed some proportional bias. Good discriminant validity was detected for control/patient (Cohen's d = 2.114). ROC analysis showed significantly better AUC for NARQoL-21 (0.939) than KIDSCREEN (0.877). A cut-off score equivalent to KIDSCREEN-10 for suboptimal HrQoL which maximized sensitivity (84%) and specificity (92%) was found at NARQoL-21 score below 42.'
2:::20% random sample of all 6 years of the School of Medicine in Kyrgyz State Medical Academy were interviewed in spring 2016. The questionnaire included sections on tobacco products consumption and knowledge and attitude to counseling. We verified smoking status with exhaled CO measurement using Bedfont Smokelyzer.
3:::In 618 students (48% female), the overall daily cigarette smoking prevalence was 21% (34% in males and 6% in females), being highest in years 1 and 3 and least in year 5 (prevalence difference 14%). With very low smokeless products and electronic cigarettes use prevalence, ever-smoking prevalence of waterpipe use was very high, reaching 85% in 6-year male students with alarmingly high prevalence in female students also. Only 74% students responded there was 100% evidence of harmful effects of tobacco, unchanged throughout the course of study.
4:::The administration of probiotics strains was effective in reducing DES. In light of these results, we have identified in our probiotic (Saccharomyces boulardii MYA796 and Enterococcus faecium SGEf01) activity integration with the action of tear substitutes, along with standardization of clinical parameters of the tear film and microbiological activity in restoring of the microbiota ocular surface subject with DES.
3:::The 124 patients included in the analysis received a median propofol dosage of 3.2 (2.5-3.9) [median (IQR)] mg/kg/h. The included patients showed 287 movement responses after a total of 725 investigated stimuli. The prediction probabilities for positive movement responses were 0.63 (95%CI: 0.59-0.67) for the NFRT and 0.69 (95%CI: 0.65-0.73) for the BIS.
2:::We collected data from 48 SRS children and 48 short children born small for gestational age (SGA) seen at our center. The SRS children were 4.6 ± 2.0 years of age, and the SGA children were 4.8 ± 1.8 years of age. All patients were prepubertal and growth hormone naive. An 11p15 ICR1 loss of methylation (11p15LOM) was present in 22, maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (upd(7)mat) in 7, and IGF2 genomic mutation (IGF2mut) in 3 patients. Growth factors were measured by in-house radioimmunoassays.
3:::The results demonstrated a low tendency to deceive and low inhibition in older adults compared with younger ones. The low tendency to deceive in the older adults was significantly correlated with their diminished inhibitory ability.
4:::The results support the conclusion that increasing BMI is causally related to higher prevalence of asthma and decreased lung function, but not with hay fever or biomarkers of allergy. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
2:::Pathology reports of patients treated at the Childrens Cancer Institute in Lebanon were retrospectively reviewed for the period 2008-2016 and compared with same samples' diagnoses at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Diagnostic disagreements were divided into major, minor, and none based on their effect on diagnosis and/or patient management.'
3:::Reference intervals were as follows: reticulocytes (×10(9) /L): 23.2-93.2; immature reticulocyte fraction: 0.015-0.14; mean reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent (RHE) (pg): 30.9-35.7; mean reticulocyte volume (fL): 97.8-118. Imprecision on reticulocyte count at all concentrations was close to analytic goal based on within-subject biological variation. Carryover (2.3%) was negligible, and time-stability was excellent up to 8 hours.
4:::Based on these results, VHA is using penalized logistic regression in initial intervention implementation. The paper concludes with a discussion of other practical issues that might be explored to increase model performance.
2:::A cross-sectional, population-based study was carried out in a midsize Brazilian city to evaluate different health risk factors. Using a stratified random sampling procedure to select a representative sample of adults, this study interviewed 1572 individuals face-to-face. Our analytical sample focused on those aged ≥60 years (n = 355). Statistical procedures were carried out using spss software, with the significance level set as P < 0.05.
3:::We demonstrate that LWA300, a pan-reactive proteasomal probe, is most suitable to report proteasomal activity in muscle cells using cell-based bio-imaging. We found that proteasomal activity is two-fold and three-fold enhanced in fused muscle cell culture compared with non-fused cells. Moreover, we found that proteasomal activity can discriminate between muscles. Across muscles, a relative higher proteasomal activity was found in hybrid myofibers whereas fast-twitch myofibers displayed lower activity.
2:::A retrospective analysis using data from a database matched with the overall population covered by German statutory health insurance was performed. To describe the treatment rate and costs of IHs, a search algorithm was developed dividing the study population into three groups (patients with IHs, patients with IHs possibly requiring treatment, and patients with IHs receiving treatment).
3::: Nineteen incontinent and twenty-seven continent women were included in this study. Before the foot touched the ground caudal translation and forward rotation of the vaginal probe was detected, whereas after heel-strike a cranial translation and backward rotation was measured. Cranial-caudal translation as well as backward-forward-rotation did not differ significantly between continent and incontinent subjects for the three speeds. Analysis of maximum displacements showed significantly increasing displacement with increasing speeds.
4:::We report an extensively evaluated case of allergic contact dermatitis caused by a temporary Earth Jagua® tattoo. The allergen identified is genipin, a substance that is increasingly used for tattoos and as a therapeutic agent in medicine. This could result in an increase in the number of allergic reactions in the future.
