1:::Determine which posterior uveal melanoma (PUM) size classification with three categories has the best prognostic discrimination.
2:::Single-institution study of 424 consecutive patients with PUM. The tumors largest basal diameter (LBD), smallest basal diameter (SBD), and thickness (TH) were estimated by fundus mapping and ultrasonography. Tumors were assigned to ""small,"" ""medium,"" or ""large"" size categories defined by 11 different classifications (Linear LBD, Rectangular LBD × TH, Cubic LBD × SBD × TH, Warren Original, Warren Modified, Augsburger, COMS Original, COMS Revised, TNM 2002, and modified TNM 2010 classification [a,b]). Prognostic significance of classifications was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier event curves with computation of log rank test for trend statistic.'
3:::In six classification systems (Warren Original, Warren Modified, COMS Revised, TNM 2002, TNM 2010a, TNM 2010b) >50% of tumors fell within one subgroup. In the Warren Original classification <5% of tumors fell within one subgroup. Separation of Kaplan-Meier curves among three size categories was judged ""excellent"" in four classifications (Linear LBD, Cubic Volume, TNM 2010a, and TNM 2010b) and ""very poor"" in the Warren Original. Linear LBD classification was associated with highest log rank statistic value. TNM 2010a, TNM 2010b, TNM 2002, Augsburger, and Cubic Volume classifications were also determined to be quite good.
4:::Linear LBD classification was the best three-size category discriminator among low-, intermediate-, and high-risk subgroups. Considering our findings, it seems possible that the arduous work required to apply complex classifications, especially for three-category systems, for PUM may not be justified in routine clinical practice.
3:::Three mutations, including a new one, in MKRN3 were found in 2 familial cases (c.1229G>A; p.Cys410Ter and c.477_485del; p.Pro160Cysfs*14) (8.7%) and in 1 sporadic case (c.982C>T; p.Arg328Cys) (2.8%). We did not find rare variants in DLK1 and KCNK9 genes.
2:::we studied 52 genetically-defined FD patients (32 with classical GLA mutations and 20 with late-onset variants or GLA polymorphisms), 15 patients with SFN associated with a specific cause and 22 healthy controls. Subjects underwent skin biopsy to evaluate Gb3 deposits and epi-dermal innervation.
4:::1) Skin Gb3 deposits are specific to FD patients with classical GLA mutations; 2) Gb3 deposits were associated with lower skin innervation but they were not found inside axons, suggesting an indirect damage on peripheral small fibre innervation.
3:::A total of 11 patients with acute Q fever hepatitis were selected and analyzed. Of the 11 patients, 3 (27%) had exposure to zoonotic risk factors and 7 (63%) met the serologic criteria. Granulomas with either circumferential or radiating fibrin deposition were observed in 10 cases on liver biopsy and in 1 case on bone marrow biopsy. 8 (73%) revealed positive Coxiella burnetii PCR from their formalin-fixed liver tissues. In contrast, none of 10 patients with alternative diagnosis who had hepatic granuloma revealed positive C. burnetii PCR from their formalin-fixed liver tissues.
2:::Participants, recruited from seven centres in six leprosy endemic countries, were assessed using the ENLIST ENL Severity Scale by two researchers, one of whom categorised the severity of ENL. At a subsequent visit a further assessment using the scale was made and both participant and physician rated the change in ENL using the subjective categories of ""Much better"", ""somewhat better"", ""somewhat worse"" and ""much worse"" compared with ""No change"" or ""about the same"".
3:::Out of 129 patients, 16S rRNA was detected in 65% of lesions at baseline. The M. ulcerans 16S rRNA remained positive in 78% of patients with unhealed lesions at 4 weeks, 52% at 8 weeks, 23% at 12 weeks and 10% at week 16. The median time to clearance of M. ulcerans 16S rRNA was 12 weeks. BU lesions with positive 16S rRNA after antibiotic treatment had significantly higher bacterial load at baseline, longer healing time and lower healing rate at week 4 compared with those in which 16S rRNA was not detected at baseline or had become undetectable by week 4.
4:::This study indicates a significantly more intense DE-induced anticoagulation in diabetic rats that does not seem to be solely related to altered kidney function, and demonstrates that plasma cholesterol can significantly affect DE-anticoagulation in this setting. These results could explain the similar benefits of DE on stroke prevention in patients with and without DM, despite the significantly higher intrinsic thrombotic risk of the former, as well as the lack of benefit of reducing major bleeding in diabetics.
2:::We conducted a randomized controlled trial in which CHB patients with spontaneous SAE were randomized to receive lamivudine (LVD) or entecavir (ETV) between July 2012 and April 2016 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01627223). The serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) viral loads on day 1 (baseline), 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 85, and 180 after initiating NA therapy were checked and analyzed.
3:::A total of 89 bacterial isolates were studied which included Escherichia coli (n=43), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=18), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=10), Enterobacter cloacae (n=6), Acinetobacter baumannii (n=5), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=4), Proteus mirabilis (n=2) and Salmonella paratyphi (n=1). MIC testing showed that 58/89 (65 %) and 29/89 (32 %) isolates were resistant to meropenem and colistin, respectively, whereas 27/89 (30 %) isolates were resistant to both antibiotics. Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae isolates were blaNDM-1-positive (n=20). Some strains of Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca were blaOXA-181-positive (n=4). Class 1, 2 and 3 integrons were found in 24, 20 and 3 isolates, respectively. Nine NDM-1-positive Escherichia coli strains could transfer carbapenem resistance via plasmids to susceptible Escherichia coli AB1157. Meropenem and colistin showed synergy in 10/20 (50 %) isolates by 24 h time-kill studies.
1:::To determine associations between physical activity (PA) and myopia in Danish school children and investigate the prevalence of myopia.
4:::This model-based subgrouping of IBS partly supports the distinction of subgroups based on bowel habits, but additionally distinguishes subgroups with or without co-morbid extraintestinal somatic and psychological symptoms. The resulting groups show specific profiles of symptom combinations.
3:::In simulation, spectral-spatial pulses yielded lower normalized root mean squared excitation error than spectral pulses. For both experiments, the spectral-spatial pulse images are also qualitatively better (more uniform, less signal loss) than the spectral pulse images.
2:::The 2002 to 2013 National Inpatient Sample was queried for patients undergoing TSS for pituitary neoplasm. Patients with an additional diagnosis of OSA were identified, and compared to a non-OSA cohort.
3:::Thirty-five cases were studied (92% males), with a mean (SD) age of 56.2 (9.3) years. Following treatment, majority of patients demonstrated stable disease (n = 15 [42%]), followed by partial response (29%), progressive disease (22%), and complete remission (6%). Significant improvement occurred in respiratory symptoms. Body fat declined while subscapular skinfold thickness and 6-min walk distance increased. Spirometric values and performance status remained unchanged. GPx levels declined significantly while no notable change was observed in MDA and TAS levels.
3:::Baseline characteristics (n = 36) were: mean age 33 years, 35 (97%) without health insurance, 32 (89%) born in Mexico, and mean BMI 30 kg/m(2). Engagement was high among the 36 participants with 33 (92%) completing the intervention and follow-up measures. At follow-up, most participants thought the intervention was helpful (range: 85-100%) and acceptable (100% agreed I would recommend the program to others'). The mean dietary fat quality score improved by 0.5 units (95% CI: 0.0-1.1) and the mean fruit-vegetable servings/day improved by 0.7/day (95% CI: 0.1-1.3).'
4:::Planner skills can be used to address barriers to planning for people with cognitive disability and complex support needs. Gaining skills took professional support and personal commitment.
2:::We studied sensitivity of mechanical hyperalgesia induced by a single intrathecal (i.t.) injection of BDNF (3 ng/10 μL i.t.) administered at time zero, for: (1) chronic NMDA receptor inhibition with subcutaneously implanted 7-day delivery osmotic pumps loaded with ketamine; (2) TrkB receptor inhibition with intraperitoneal (i.p.) cyclotraxine-B; and (3) chronic glial inhibition with repeated propentofylline i.t. injections. Nociceptive threshold to paw pressure, tested on days -3, 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14, was used as the index of central sensitization. Locomotor patterns and food and water consumption were assessed with LABORAS.
3:::Of the 60 143 paediatric ED presentations during the study period, 1551 allergy-related presentations were identified and reviewed. One hundred and eighty-seven met consensus criteria for anaphylaxis, and another 24 were diagnosed with anaphylaxis without meeting criteria. Of the 211 presentations, 105 cases were given an ED diagnosis of anaphylaxis and 106 cases were given an alternative diagnosis in ED. ED assessment had a sensitivity of 43.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 36.1-50.7%) and specificity of 97.9% (95% CI 96.9-98.7%) for anaphylaxis. Multiple logistic regression demonstrated that an ED anaphylaxis diagnosis was associated with previous anaphylaxis (odds ratio (OR) 3.20; 95% CI 1.52-6.75), arrival by ambulance (OR 2.80; 95% CI 1.36-5.74), a high-acuity triage category (OR 4.51; 95% CI 2.20-9.25) and presentation to a tertiary hospital (OR 2.86; 95% CI 1.44-5.67). ED diagnosis of anaphylaxis was less likely in those with resolution of symptoms and signs in at least one organ system prior to arrival (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.12-0.62).
2:::All 580 consecutive patients aged ≥75 years (age 80 ± 4.9 years, 57.4% males) undergoing PCI between April 2006 and November 2011 were included. A total of 624 consecutive lesions were identified and analyzed. All V. Eld. patients (n = 253) were subsequently selected, and their outcomes compared to Eld. patients (n = 327). Mean follow-up was 30.8 ± 2.7 months with 98% clinical follow-up achieved.
3:::Response rate was 100%. The majority of departments (84%) managed all EVT cases at their respective centres. Most departments have institutional guidelines on anaesthetic management (84%) including blood pressure management (63%) and were able to provide a 24-h immediate response to an EVT request (63%). Conscious sedation was favoured by 68% of the departments using a variety of sedation protocols. Propofol and remifentanil was preferred for GA (58%). Emergent conversion to GA due to uncontrolled patient movements or loss of airway was experienced by 82% and 35% of the departments, respectively. Majority of the departments (89%) responded that non-specialist anaesthetists occasionally handle EVT cases.
4:::An address-based indicator can identify a large proportion of Medicaid enrollees who are experiencing homelessness. This approach may be of interest to researchers, states, and health systems attempting to identify homeless populations.
3::: The inner diameters of capillary vessels beneath the epithelium and in the middle of villi were 16.2 ± 3.0 µm and 14.5 ± 3.1 µm, respectively, in the pCLE images, but these were not consistent with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded histology. In tumors, larger capillary vessels were observed in aggressive malignant lymphoma and metastasis, and a ""soccer ball-like pattern"" constituting homogenous dark cells packed with polygonal, narrower capillary vessels was characteristic in pCLE images of a malignant lymphoma follicle. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and angiodysplasia contained anastomosis of capillary vessels of different calibers. In IgA vasculitis, segmental capillary strictures were observed. Intestinal lymphangiectasia with protein-losing enteropathy contained a reticular network of lymphatic vessels and dilated lymphatic ducts accompanied by numerous cell gaps. pCLE findings corresponded to pathologic diagnosis in 32 examinations (91 %).
2:::This is a descriptive (cross-sectional) study; census method was used for sampling. Study population consists of 265 people, employed at units of family health and vaccination in Tabriz healthcare centers in 2015-2016. A questionnaire was used to collect the data. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS, version 23 through descriptive (mean and standard deviation) and analytical (Two Independent Samples T-test and analysis of variance) statistics.
4:::The middle-aged had a relatively high percentage of interest (above 45%) in orthodontic treatment. However, demographic characteristics were not significantly associated with the positive interest. These results highlight the need for educating the middle-aged about the limitations and possibilities of orthodontic treatment to increase its acceptance.
3:::Among 103 patients with type 2 diabetes, 75 (72.82%) were found to have Vitamin D deficiency. Amidst these patients, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (991.6 ± 161.82 vs. 899.29 ± 151.86, P < 0.001), right brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (1446.16 ± 204.33 vs. 1350.8 ± 178.39, P < 0.001), and left brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (1493.81 ± 219.65 vs. 1367.61 ± 220.64, P < 0.001) showed a significant reduction following Vitamin D supplementation. Further, these patients were found to have significant fall in serum malondialdehyde levels with rise in total antioxidant status ensuing Vitamin D supplementation.
3:::We observed spermatogonial stem-like colonies in the G and 10% groups, but not the CTRL group. Immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and RT-PCR confirmed expressions of germ cell markers in these cells. In the spermatogonial stem-like cells, we observed a significant expression (P<0.05) of germ cell markers in the G and 10% groups versus the testis cells (T). Their proliferative and apoptotic activities were examined by Ki67 and PI/annexin V-FITC. Alkaline phosphatase assay showed that mouse spermato- gonial stem-like colonies were partially positive.
3:::A total of 599 patients with IBD (387 with Crohns disease [CD] and 212 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) were enrolled. The majority of patients (81%) expressed feelings of fatigue, weakness, and being worn out in their daily lives during times of flare; this percentage was reduced to 61% during remission. Respondents were absent from work or school for an average period of 18 days because of illness, within the first 6 months; the majority of respondents (64%) felt stressed about their absence. Forty-six percent of the respondents reported having received unfair comments at work, or having suffered discrimination. Forty-seven percent of the respondents felt that IBD had negatively affected their income and earnings. Compared with patients with UC, those with CD reported a more frequent negative impact of IBD on work, or more economic burden. More than half of the respondents (61%) reported that IBD had prevented them from making or keeping friends.'
2:::A team of seven informationists with broad systematic review experience examined existing systematic review standards, conducted a literature search, and used their own expertise to identify core competencies and skills that are necessary to undertake various roles in systematic review projects.
3:::Increasing age improved recall rates (27.4% in 40s, 17.5% in 50's, 11.1% in 60's, and 8.6% in 70's), CDR (2.7, 3.2, 2.0, and 2.4), PPV (1.0, 1.8, 1.8, and 2.8%), sensitivity (81.3, 88.8, 90.3, and 94.7%), specificity (72.7, 82.7, 89.0, and 91.7%), and FPR (27.3, 17.3, 11.0, and 8.4%) (p < 0.05). Higher breast density impaired recall rates (4.0% in P1, 9.0% in P2, 28.9% in P3, and 27.8% in P4), PPV (3.3, 2.3, 1.2, and 1.3%), specificity (96.1, 91.2, 71.4, and 72.5%), and FPR (3.9, 8.9, 28.6, and 27.6%) (p < 0.001). It also increased CDR (1.3, 2.1, 3.3, and 3.6) and ICR (0.2, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.6) (p < 0.05). Successive visits to the same institution improved recall rates (20.9% for one visit, 10.7% for two visits, 7.7% for more than three visits), PPV (1.6, 2.8, and 2.7%), specificity (79.4, 89.6, and 92.5%), and FPR (20.6, 10.4, and 7.5%) (p < 0.001).'
4:::The QRI identified key issues that enabled the integration of the trial into the clinical setting. This contributed to successful recruitment in the By-Band-Sleeve trial-currently the largest in bariatric practice-and offers opportunities to optimize recruitment in other trials in bariatrics.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 03 July 2017. doi:10.1038/ijo.2017.153.
3:::The mean height of prolactinomas (23.2±11.3 mm) was similar to nonfunctioning adenomas (22.3±9.3 mm, p=0.8), and so were mean tumor volumes (prolactinoma=5.9±8 ml vs. nonfunctioning adenoma=4.8±5 ml, p=0.47). However, the mean suprasellar growth for prolactinomas was 2.9±5.3 mm and 7.3±4.7 mm for nonfunctioning adenomas (p<0.001), and the mean infrasellar growth was 10.2±8.0 and 5.0±6.6 mm, respectively (p=0.04). The inferior growth pattern of prolactinomas was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of having visual field abnormalities (11.4 vs. 57.1%, p<0.001).
2:::PubMed and Embase databases were searched from inception to May 2016 for studies linking trial registries with bibliographic databases. The processes used to establish these links were categorised as automatic when the registration identifier was available in the bibliographic database or publication, or manual when linkage required inference or contacting of trial investigators. The number of links identified by each process was extracted where available. Linear regression was used to determine whether the proportions of links available via automatic processes had increased over time.
4:::Outpatient visits during the 30 days after discharge were associated with a lower hospital readmission risk during the following 90 days. Assertive hospital discharge planning to secure outpatient visits after hospital discharge is needed for these patient populations.
3:::There were 18 (14.2%) p16-positive, 45 (35.4%) p53-positive, 9 (7.1%) HPV DNA-positive, and 7 (5.5%) E6 and/or E7 mRNA-positive tumors, but the correlation of all pairs was poor. There was no demographic or histopathologic association with HPV status. Cause-specific survival was significantly better with p16-positive than with p16-negative tumors (p = .037).
2:::Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from good crop silage were screened by growing them in MRS broth and a minimal medium with low carbohydrate content. Selected LAB (LAB 1821) were Gram-positive, rods, catalase negative, and were identified to be Lactobacillus plantarum based on their biochemical characteristics and a 16S rRNA analysis. Fresh rice straw was ensiled with two isolated LAB (1821 and 1841), two commercial inoculants (HM/F and P1132) and no additive as a control.
3:::Most (88.4%) patients were on pharmacological treatment, with 53.8% of persons taking ≥3 medications. No significant changes in these percentages were observed over the study period. The use of tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines decreased, while the use of atypical antipsychotics increased. Axis I comorbidity was the main factor associated with pharmacological treatment and polypharmacy.
1:::Due to the diversity within Europe, the implementation of pharmacogenomic testing in clinical practice faces specific challenges. In the context of the European pharmacogenomics implementation project ""Ubiquitous Pharmacogenomics"" (U-PGx; funded by the European Commission), we studied the current educational background.
4:::Pain is very prevalent within PPN. Pain specialists should be aware of this. Detailed history-taking, full clinical examination, and requesting nerve conduction studies might lead to an earlier diagnosis of an underlying malignancy.
2:::We isolated a high-affinity CD13-specific single-chain fragment variable (scFv13) from a phage display library of V-genes from mice immunized with soluble antigen. An immunotoxin comprising the scFv13 and a truncated version of the exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ETA, scFv13-ETA') and a bispecific scFv targeting CD13 and CD16 simultaneously (bsscFv[13xds16]) was generated and investigated for their therapeutic potential.'
3:::MMP-2 and -9 expression were suppressed significantly by treatment with SB-3CT. The data demonstrated, for the first time, that SB-3CT strongly reduced corneal lymphangiogenesis and macrophage infiltration during inflammation. Furthermore, expressions of VEGF-C and its receptor VEGFR-3 were significantly inhibited by SB-3CT during corneal lymphangiogenesis.
4:::RTI accounted for the majority of trauma admissions to our PICU. RTI, female gender and age less than 4 years were all associated with an increased risk for mortality in our study.
3:::Elevated AFP levels were found in 5 patients (1.97%, 95% CI 0.19-3.68) and in 4 controls (2.04%, 95% CI 0.06-4.02). The elevations were modest and kept elevated throughout the clinical course. No hepatic disorders were recorded. Histologically, pure seminoma was confirmed.
2:::This observational study was conducted in 3 tertiary hospitals. The minimal distance between the PSC and the posterior cranial fossa (PSC thickness) was estimated by thin-section multidetector row computed axial tomography (CAT) scan of the temporal bones. Nonselected consecutive patients of all ages (607 temporal bones) were considered.
3:::Immune-cell therapy increased median survival time (21.5 months) in patients with advanced GC. The patients who underwent surgery with or without chemotherapy as a prior treatment showed better prognosis than those who received other therapies (p<0.001). Patients who showed stable disease or a partial response to immune-cell therapy had a better prognosis than those with progressive disease (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that performance status, the type of immune-cell therapy, and prior treatment were independent prognostic factors for patients with GC. No serious adverse event was reported in immune-cell therapy.
3:::During second-line treatment, a total of 59 patients received 520 chemotherapy applications. As the main higher-grade symptom of toxicity, diarrhea (NCI-CTC-toxicity grade 3) presented in 8 patients (13.6%, 95%CI=5.1-23.7), followed by leukocytopenia (CTC grade 3) in 3 patients (5.1%, 95%CI=0-11.9), followed by thrombocytopenia (CTC grade 3) in 1 patient (1.7%, 95%CI=0-5.1). Fifty-nine patients were evaluable for treatment response. The remission data can be summarized as follows: complete remission (CR); n=0; partial remission (PR); n=6 (10%; 95%CI=3.4-18.6); stable disease (SD); n=31 (53%; 95%CI=39.0-64.4); progressive disease (PD); n=19 (33%; 95%CI=20.3-44.1). The median progression-free survival (PFS) rate (n=59) was 4.2 months (range=3.8-5.8 months). The median survival time counted from the start of second-line treatment (n=59) 14.2 months (range 8.2-17.3 months) and the median survival time counted from the start of first-line therapy (n=59) 25 months (range 19-27 months).
3:::Flow cytometry revealed significant binding of aptamer and conjugate in the MCF-7 and WERI-Rb1 cell lines. Briefly, 62% in MCF and 30% in WERI-Rb1 cells with conjugate treated cells (p<0.005). The cell-cycle analysis indicated G2 phase arrest in MCF-7 cells and S phase arrest in WERI-Rb1 cells (p<0.005). Microarray analysis showed differentially expressed genes involved in cell cycle, DNA damage, and apoptosis. The BrDU assay and the apoptosis assay showed that the expression of BrDU was reduced in conjugate-treated cells and the PARP levels were increased confirming the double stranded DNA breaks (p<0.005). In MCF-7 and WERI-Rb1 cells, most of the cells underwent necrosis (p<0.005).
3:::Overall higher levels of ALK7 transcripts were seen in the breast cancer samples vs. normal tissue. However, within the cancer cohort, lower levels of ALK7 transcript were associated with poor prognosis. Patients with lower expression of ALK7 also had shorter survival. Overexpression of ALK7 reduced proliferation and adhesion of breast cancer cells in vitro. We found that overexpressed ALK7 had complex effects on the MCF-7 cell sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs.
2:::A quantitative-qualitative study of 96 men and 54 women with SpA was conducted at the Alicante University General Hospital, in a Spanish Mediterranean city, from March 2013 to February 2014. Descriptive and qualitative content analyses compared working lives and family/partner relationships of male and female patients.
3:::All patients presented with prominent cerebellar signs, which were often associated with memory loss and/or oculomotor, visual or peripheral/spinal cord signs. In contrast, dementia was invariably a late finding. All CSF samples were positive for the 14-3-3 protein assay and had total-tau protein levels above 1250 pg/mL. Brain DW-MRI showed hyperintensity of basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebral cortex, respectively in 91.5%, 57.4% and 19.1% of cases. EEG revealed periodic sharp-wave complexes in only 17.8% of cases.
4:::sCJDVV2 should be considered in any patient presenting with a rapidly progressive ataxia, especially when associated with oculomotor, visual or peripheral/spinal cord signs, even in the absence of dementia or myoclonus. CSF assays and brain DW-MRI represent sensitive diagnostic tests, even at an early stage. These data strongly suggest that sCJDVV2 can be clinically diagnosed early and accurately based on clinical data, DW-MRI, CSF assays and codon 129 genotyping and provide the basis for improved and subtype-specific diagnostic criteria of sCJD.
1:::To estimate the diagnostic value of multi-slice spiral CT angiography (CTA) in lower gastrointestinal bleeding by a meta-analysis.
3:::25 patients (mean age 10.8±4.5 years, range 4 months to 16 years) were included. MRE was diagnostic in 76% (19 of 25). The most frequent diagnoses were intestinal polyp (28%) and Meckels diverticulum (16%). Sensitivity and specificity of MRE were 86% and 100% respectively. There were no reported complications during any of the examinations.'
4:::This study indicates that Volpara™ Density Maps is reliable in estimating the local glandular tissue distribution and can be used for its assessment and follow-up. Volpara™ Density Maps is robust to small variations of the acquisition angle and to the beam energy, although divergences arise due to different breast compression conditions.
2:::CTA datasets of 26 patients were analyzed retrospectively with the proposed methodology, which consists of a knowledge-based segmentation of the aortic root and detection of the orientation and size of the aortic annulus. The accuracy of the methodology was determined by comparing the automatically derived results with the reference standard obtained by semi-automatic delineation of the aortic root and manual definition of the annulus plane.
3:::The frequencies of A muciniphila, C leptum, and F prausnitzii in healthy controls stool samples were significantly more than those of patients with CU (P < .001, P < .01, and P < .05, respectively), whereas the Enterobacteriaceae family was detected in all patients and healthy controls' stool samples. The relative amounts of A muciniphila in healthy control positive samples were significantly higher than those of samples from patients with CU (P < .001). Furthermore, there was a corresponding increase of relative amounts of C leptum and F prausnitzii in healthy control positive samples compared with those of patients with CU (P = .09 and P = .08, respectively). The mean of the relative amounts of Enterobacteriaceae family in the stool samples from patients with CU was more than that of healthy controls; however, the difference was nearly significant (P = .12).'
2:::We treated primary cultures of murine brain microvessel endothelial cells (BMEC), astrocytes, and microglia with PBS or IL-1β, and then performed qPCR to measure inflammatory gene expression or immunocytochemistry to evaluate nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation. To evaluate whether astrocytes and/or BMEC propagate inflammatory signals to microglia, we exposed microglia to astrocyte-conditioned media and co-cultured endothelial cells and glia in transwells. Treatment groups were compared by Students t tests or by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni-corrected t tests.'
3:::The difference in mortality rate between total CVD and cancer narrowed over the study period as age-standardized mortality from CVD decreased more steeply than cancer in both sexes. We observed higher overall rates for both diseases in men compared to women, with high mortality rates from ischemic heart disease and lung cancer in men. Joinpoint regression analysis indicated that trends of decreasing rates of CVD have increased over time while decreasing trends in cancer mortality rates have slowed down since the 1990s. The lowest improvements in mortality rates were for cancer in those over 75 years of age and lung cancer in women.
4:::Among people seeking help to stop smoking from their general practice, one-off brief advice from a general practitioner appears to be as effective as several sessions of behavioural support from a practice nurse when smoking cessation medication is provided.
2:::A total of 2223 consecutive patients undergoing PCI from the radial approach were analyzed. Radial access failure mode and requirement for crossover to femoral access during a 12-month run-in period were compared with the following 14-month period with routine BAT usage.
3:::Ethanol reduced LV function (dP/dtmax and LVDP) and BP, and increased cardiac NADPH oxidase activity, ROS and MDA levels, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Either inhibitor partially, and their combination significantly, attenuated these responses despite the substantially higher blood ethanol level, and the increased cardiac oxidative stress and reduced BP caused by 3-AT alone or with 4-MP. The inhibitors reduced cardiac MDA level and reversed ethanol effect on cardiac and plasma MDA.
4:::We present strong evidence for construct validity and interrater reliability of ARCS. Our study shows that learning curves for some console skills plateau faster than others. Therefore, ARCS may be more useful than GEARS to evaluate distinct console skills. Future studies will examine why some domains did not adequately differentiate between subjects and applications for intraoperative use.
3:::A 10 μg/m(3) increase in PM10 concentration was associated with 1.95% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02%, 3.91%) increase in respiratory emergency room visits. No significant interaction with desert dust episodes was observed. Compared with non-dust days, there was a 47% (95% CI: 29%, 68%) increase in visits in dust days not adjusting for PM10. Desert dust days were associated with higher numbers of emergency room visits for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory infections with increases of 38%, 57% and 60%, respectively (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Analyses of respiratory hospital admissions provided similar results. PM10 effects decreased when adjusting for desert dust days and were further confounded by co-pollutants.
2:::This is a retrospective clinical research study. Forty-five patients underwent operative hysteroscopy to remove the residual gestational tissue in the caesarean scar after failed D&C treatment. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of hysteroscopic surgeries of 45 CSP cases were investigated. All data analyses were conducted with SPSS 17.0.
3:::Of the 703 890 CDC-funded HIV testing events conducted in nonhealthcare facilities in 2015, 6848 (0.9%) were provided to adolescent MSM aged 13-19 years. Among those tested, 1.8% were newly diagnosed with HIV, compared with 0.7% among total tests provided in nonhealthcare facilities regardless of age and sex. The odds of testing positive among black adolescent MSM were nearly four times that of white adolescent MSM in multivariable analysis (odds ratio = 3.97, P < 0.001). Among adolescent MSM newly diagnosed with HIV, 67% were linked to HIV medical care. Linkage was lower among black (59%) and Hispanic/Latino adolescent MSM (71%) compared with white adolescent MSM (88%).
2:::Using a door-to-door approach that includes systematically revisiting households, all adolescents enumerated were offered participation in the intervention and verbal consent was obtained. Data were analysed from October 2015 to September 2016.
3:::The deep infection rate for standard operating theatres was 0 of 684 (0%); for temporary theatres it was eight of 539 (1.5%) (p = 0.001).
4:::In patients with newly diagnosed AF, cardiology care was associated with improved outcomes, potentially mediated by early prescription of oral anticoagulation therapy. Although hypothesis-generating, these data warrant serious consideration and study of health care system interventions at the time of new AF diagnosis.
3:::Initial data found that students were satisfied or strongly satisfied with their collaborative nursing education (M ± SD = 183.9 ± 32.7). However, any type of conflict had a significant negative relationship with satisfaction in all domains. No other significant predictors of satisfaction were uncovered.
2:::Thirty-six female Wistar rats weighing 150-200 g were randomly divided into six groups of six rats each. Thirty rats were induced for type 1 DM (DM1) with a single intraperitoneal administration of 65 mg/kg body weight of streptozotocin. Group 1 was normal control and was administered distilled water while Group 2 served as DM1 control group; Groups 3, 4, 5 and 6 were diabetic rats treated with 208 mg/kg OG (DM1 + OG), 52 mg/kg VA (DM1 + VA), 208 mg/kg OG + 52 mg/kg VA (DM1 + OG + VA) and 0.16 IU insulin (DM1 + insulin) respectively. Determination of methemoglobin and sulfhemoglobin was achieved by the absorption spectrum principle. Red blood cell (RBC) catalase was assayed by continuous spectrophotometric method.
3:::Data analysis revealed that perceived competency in palliative and EOL care is significantly higher in the ICU nurses (p <.0001). Mean scores were significantly higher when nurses had more than 10 years of experience (p <.0001). Open-ended responses indicated concerns regarding improved communication behaviors, decision making, and facilitation of continuity of care.
4:::A lower retinal thickness at the parafovea and a higher BMI can predict 4-year incident neuropathy in patients with diabetes, with acceptable diagnostic accuracies. This OCT-derived measure may serve as a potential ophthalmic marker in the screening of patients at risk of developing DPN.
3:::Ephedrine administration was significantly associated with decreased risk of intraoperative flap complications (OR, 0.88), including vasospasm, thrombosis, and congestion requiring revision, compared with controls, after controlling for the severity and duration of hypotension. Phenylephrine had no significant association with complication rates. Vasopressor administration was not associated with an increased risk of reoperation in the setting of necrosis within 60 days.
2:::The authors institutional database was queried for nonsyndromic craniosynostosis from 2000 to 2014. Patients with an identified syndrome were excluded. Specific data elements included age, gender, velopharyngeal adequacy by means of the Pittsburgh Weighted Speech Scale, evaluation for anatomical motor delay, language acquisition delay/disorder, articulation or speech sound production delays/disorders, and whether speech therapy was recommended. Diagnosis of a submucous cleft palate was noted.'
1:::This case report presents an interdisciplinary approach in school-based therapy, combining physical therapy and applied behavior analysis to improve the motor skills and the participation in recreational activities of a child with autism spectrum disorder.
3:::The crude method showed a significant higher reduction in HIV-1 RNA reduction in patients receiving raltegravir plus etravirine compared with patients receiving raltegravir (mean reduction of 2.1 versus 1.8 log10 copies/mL). However, survival methods adjusted for both censoring, due to the limit of quantification, and confounding factors lead to a nonsignificant difference between the 2 treatment groups (mean reduction of 2.8 versus 2.7 log10 copies/mL).
2:::Using data from the Karonga Health and Demographic Surveillance Site in Malawi from 2005 to 2014, we used total and age-specific fertility rates and Cox regression to assess associations between HIV and ART use and fertility. We also assessed temporal trends in in utero and breastfeeding HIV and ART exposure among live births.
4:::Our findings indicate that underreporting of concussion among those players interviewed appears to be prevalent and associated with misconceptions about injury risk, and a culture that both reinforces and encourages underreporting with tacit or overt complicity of parents and coaches. Our findings support the need to alter the culture of violence and tough play in hockey by education, rule changes, economic measures, and changes in governance of the sport. Interviewing more stakeholders and policy makers would shed light on such potential interventions.
3:::Both patients remain in an overall good condition 27 and 5 months respectively following treatment for HEHE.
3:::The results showed that there is no significant association of the RCC risk with the MMP-7 A-181G genotype, even after adjusted for the possible confounding factors. The MMP-7 C-153T polymorphism was not identified among the subjects investigated.
2:::The mandibular second premolars of 7 beagle dogs were extracted, and on a randomly selected side, a full-thickness mucoperiosteal buccal flap extending from the distal aspect of the third premolar to the mesial aspect of the first premolar was elevated. The other side did not receive flap surgery. The mandibular third premolars were protracted with orthodontic appliances. Tooth movements were analyzed biweekly over an 8-week period with calipers and radiographs. The amount and density of bone were analyzed using microcomputed tomography; bone remodeling was evaluated with histologic sections.
3:::Of 4269 records, 80 full texts were obtained, with 24 studies meeting the selection criteria. Of these, 11 were included in the quantitative synthesis. A weighted estimate of objectively assessed compliance levels in relation to stipulated wear time was calculated with the discrepancy highest in the headgear group (5.81 hours per day, 95% confidence interval, 4.98, 6.64) based on 6 studies. The mean discrepancy between self-reported and objectively assessed headgear wear was 5.02 hours per day (95% confidence interval, 3.64, 6.40). Compliance level was not directly related to appliance type (P = 0.211). Thematic synthesis was not undertaken because of the limited number of qualitative studies.
4:::Compliance with removable orthodontic appliances and adjuncts is suboptimal, and patients routinely overestimate duration of wear. Techniques for improving compliance have promise but require further evaluation in high-level research.
3:::Ten studies were included in this systematic review. The main outcomes that were measured were pain, disability, neurophysiology pain test, attitudes and beliefs, fear-avoidance beliefs, self-care, kinesiophobia, quality of life and algometry. The results suggest that pain neuroscience education is effective in the short term and medium/long term for pain relief, either alone or combined with multimodal treatment. It was also effective in normalizing cognitions about pain, fear-avoidance beliefs, and self-care.
2:::Using a nationwide, US administrative claims database, a retrospective matched-cohort of newly diagnosed NVAF patients (age≥18 years) treated with dabigatran or warfarin (propensity score matched 1:1) in 01/01/2011-12/31/2013 was evaluated. All-cause, stroke-, and bleed-specific per patient per month (PPPM) healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), incidence rate of hospitalization for stroke or bleed, 30-day readmission, and persistence were reported.
4:::Self-reported unsteadiness is independently associated with an increased risk of FOF, fear-related activity restriction, recurrent falls, and disability at follow-up. Self-reported balance/steadiness should be included in routine assessment of older adults especially those at risk of falls. As unsteadiness is modifiable, older adults should be targeted for balance-related training or medication review to minimize future risk of these outcomes.
3:::Patients with PAD had significantly reduced peak torque and area under the curve compared with controls. Measures of control differed between PAD conditions only. Load rate and linear region duration were greater in the pain condition. Time to peak torque was shorter in the pain condition.
2:::A retrospective review identified patients 18 years and older who presented to a single fellowship-trained hand surgeon with a symptomatic trigger digit during a 1-year period. Baseline demographic data were recorded. Patients with persistent trigger digit after a single injection were offered a second injection. Patients refusing a second injection were excluded from our analysis. Patients with persistent symptoms after 2 injections were offered surgery. For patients with diabetes mellitus, additional information regarding method of disease control and hemoglobin A1c level was recorded.
3:::The overall success of corticosteroid injection was 84% with 16% of patients requiring surgical release. Of the 240 patients successfully treated with injection, 99 (41%) required a second injection. Injections resulted in persistent triggering in 15% of patients with diabetes and 17% of patients without diabetes. A multivariate regression analysis revealed that the 2 strongest risk factors for requiring surgical release were patient age and patients whose fourth digit of the right hand was injected. Diabetes was not a risk factor for persistent triggering after corticosteroid injection.
4:::Clinically significant endoscopy findings were common in both controls and gastroparetics. As more than one-third of patients had findings on endoscopy, we conclude that upper endoscopy remains an important part of the evaluation process of patients with dyspeptic symptoms and suspected gastroparesis. As gross abnormalities were frequently not present with histologic changes, routine biopsy is required. There was no association between studied symptoms and the presence of gastroparesis. A comprehensive evaluation of children with dyspeptic symptoms requires endoscopy with biopsy and solid-phase gastric emptying scan to determine the underlying diagnosis.
2:::A series of 13 patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation for suspected autonomic impairment, including a neurological examination, autonomic testing, and laboratory studies. A diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome was established as the cause of autonomic dysfunction in all. Clinical features, findings on autonomic testing, and laboratory results are described.
3:::All patients in this series reported postural lightheadedness and syncope or near-syncope. Autonomic testing confirmed the presence of orthostatic hypotension on tilt-table testing in 5 patients and an excessive postural tachycardia and/or hypertensive response in 8 patients. Only 2 of the patients with orthostatic hypotension had a significant sensory neuropathy. Symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal and genitourinary impairment were seen in nearly all patients, with abnormal motility testing (most frequently esophageal dysmotility) in 5 of 6 patients who underwent formal testing. Patients in this series treated with immune-modulating therapy experienced significant improvement.
3:::A total of 491 patients (mean age 47 years) participated; 82% were below retirement age, and of these 56% were employed. Employment was related to disease severity, and MS affected productivity at work for 90% of patients. Overall, 95% and 67% of patients experienced fatigue and cognition as a problem, respectively. The mean utility and annual costs were 0.735 and €22,600 at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-3, 0.500 and €38,100 at EDSS 4-6.5, and 0.337 and €48,100 at EDSS 7-9, respectively. The average cost of a relapse was estimated at €2300.
4:::Our results indicated that fosA3 could spread through plasmids in S. flexneri isolates, along with the bla(CTX-M) and bla(TEM), which facilitate its quick dispersal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CTX-M-123-type ESBLs in S. flexneri isolates from patients in China.
3:::The study period was from 2001 to 2015. Patients (24,652) were included in the study. Of the patients, 93.7% (n = 23,091) were women and 6.3% (n = 1564) were men. Eighteen percent (4636) were dispensed only one prescription. Of the patients, 44.2% included in the study had medication possession ratio (MPR) ≥80% over follow-up period; 8922 (36.2%) who were prescribed from 2001 to 2015 persisted for 1 year with MPR ≥80% and 19.8% persisted for 3 years. Forty percent of expenditure on osteoporosis medication was made for treatment courses with insufficient adherence.
2:::A total of 15 patients reported for tooth extraction were enrolled in this study. Implants were placed in average 5.2 ± 2 months after socket grafting. At this visit, Cone Beam CT (CBCT) images and core biopsies were taken. Implant stability (ISQ) was assessed at the insertion as well as at the day of final restoration.
3:::During 36 flights, 1260 healthy subjects [626 women (F) and 634 men (M) (mean age = 43, SD = 16)] were assessed. Additionally, 72 subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (F = 32, M = 40, mean age = 48, SD = 17) and 74 with heart failure (F = 50, M = 24, mean age = 54, SD = 14) contributed to 11 flights. Additionally, 76 normal controls were observed while engaged in a usual days work (F = 38, M = 38, mean age = 39, SD = 15). There were no health-significant changes in D-Dimer, interleukin-6, or FEV1. Spo2 varied as expected, with lowest values at 8000 ft and in patients with cardiopulmonary disease. The only differences from the controls were the loss of the normal diurnal variations in interleukin-6 and D-Dimer.'
2:::A study was performed in a hypobaric chamber to characterize deterioration of cognitive performance under moderate (MH) and severe (SH) hypoxia conditions, culminating in subjects inability to perform tasks. Subjects operated a synthetic workstation, performing multiple simultaneous tasks during hypobaric exposures equivalent to 5486 m (18,000 ft) MH and 7620 m (25,000 ft) SH ascents. Performance was compared across baseline, altitude exposure, and recovery periods within MH vs. SH altitude profiles. Ascents lasted until at least one of a list of termination criteria was met, at which point the chamber was returned to ground level pressure and the subject resumed workstation performance during recovery.'
4:::Similar to findings from high-income settings, cardiology administrators and cardiologists in South America value CR as part of cardiac patient care, but funding and availability of programs restrict capacity to deliver these services.
3:::Sixty-three lesions were identified in 58 patients; 40 of the 63 (63.5%) were benign. Patients with malignant lesions had elevated serum tumor marker levels more often than patients who had benign lesions (26.1% versus 5.7%, p = 0.043). The clinical palpability of lesions and history of testicular cancer were not statistically significantly different between patients with malignant and those with benign lesions. Poorly defined margins of a lesion and focal calcification within the lesion were more often found in malignant lesions. Maximal size of a lesion and peripheral vascularity were not associated with either the benign or the malignant nature of a lesion.
2:::Between 1995 and 2014, 94 mobile spine GCT patients were treated at our hospital, comprising 43 male and 51 female patients with an average age of 33.4 years. Piecemeal intralesional spondylectomy and total en bloc spondylectomy (TES) were performed. Radiotherapy was suggested for recurrent or residual GCT cases. Since denosumab was not available before 2014 in our country, only interferon and/or zoledronic acid was suggested.
4:::In combination with DST, application of the GenoType MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl assays may be a useful supplementary tool to allow a rapid and safe diagnosis of multidrug resistance and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.
3:::Renal lymphangiectasia was diagnosed on CT IVP. In each case, where aspiration of collection fluid was offered, the laboratory diagnosis of renal lymphangiectasia was confirmed and patients were managed conservatively. However, large collection in one patient was relieved by percutaneous aspiration.
2:::In 15 patients with severe horizontal alveolar ridge resorption, lateral augmentation procedures were performed using CCXBB as bone replacement grafts. Twenty-six weeks postoperatively, a re-entry procedure was performed to evaluate the bone width for adequate implant placement and two histological specimens were retrieved from each patient, one being processed for ground sectioning and the other for decalcified paraffin-included sections. In non-decalcified sections, the relative proportions occupied by bone, biomaterials, and connective tissue present in the biopsies were identified. In de-calcified sections, structures and cells positive for osteopontin (OPN), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity (TRAP), osteocalcin (OSC), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were assessed.
3:::Soft tissue dehiscence occurred during the follow-up in 5 out of 15 patients (33.3%). The mean crest width at baseline was 2.78 mm (SD 0.57) and the mean crest width at re-entry was 6.90 mm (SD 1.22), with a mean ridge width increase of 4.12 mm (SD 1.32). Twenty-six bone biopsies were obtained from 13 patients. Histomorphometric analysis showed a mean of 26.90% (SD 12.21) of mineralized vital bone (MVB), 21.37% (SD 7.36) of residual CCXBB, 47.13% (SD 19.15) of non-mineralized tissue, and 0.92% of DBBM. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed a large number of OPN-positive cells 8.12% (SD 4.73), a lower proportion of TRAP positive multinuclear cells 5.09% (SD 4.91), OSC-positive cells 4.09% (SD 4.34), and a limited amount of ALP positive cells 1.63% (SD 2).
3:::The sample included 1,202 eyes (958 eyes with normal health and 244 eyes with early AMD). In normal eyes, SDDs were not associated with any visual function evaluated. In eyes with early AMD, dark adaptation was markedly delayed in eyes with SDDs versus no SDD (a 4-minute delay on average), P = 0.0213. However, this association diminished after age adjustment, P = 0.2645. Other visual functions in early AMD eyes were not associated with SDDs.
4:::This randomized clinical trial found that TXA administration safely reduced blood loss with a tendency for decreased transfusion rate and total blood product consumption for patients undergoing hip arthroplasty for acute FNF. More studies are needed to further ascertain the role of TXA in the management of patients with FNF.
2:::Eight Yorkshire-cross swine were splenectomized, instrumented, and subjected to rapid 25% total blood volume hemorrhage. After 30 minutes of shock, animals received 60 minutes of Zone 1 REBOA with a low-profile REBOA catheter. During subsequent resuscitation with shed blood, the aortic occlusion balloon was gradually deflated in stepwise fashion at the rate of 0.5 mL every 30 seconds until completely deflated. Aortic flow rate and proximal mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured continuously over the period of balloon deflation.
3:::Five hundred forty-three patients with NCTH underwent ENDO (n = 166, 31%), OPEN (n = 309, 57%), or RT (n = 68, 12%). Anatomic bleeding locations were 25% chest, 41% abdomen, and 31% pelvis. ENDO was used to treat relatively few types of vascular injuries, whereas OPEN and RT injuries were more diverse. ENDO patients had more blunt trauma (95% vs. 34% vs. 32%); severe injuries (median Injury Severity Score, 34 vs. 27 vs. 21), and increased time to intervention (median, 298 vs. 92 vs. 51 minutes) compared with OPEN and RT. Mortality was 15% versus 20% versus 79%. ENDO was associated with decreased mortality compared to OPEN (relative risk, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.73).
4:::Anchor sleeves with 6.5-mm-diameter pedicle screws provided markedly higher resistance to screw pullout than 7.5-mm-diameter revision screws and fixation statistically equivalent to 8.5-mm-diameter screws, possibly because of medial-lateral expansion within the vertebral space and/or convex filling of the pedicle. AS results had the lowest SD, indicating minimal variability in bone-screw purchase.
3:::With the less-invasive approach, anterior lumbar interbody fusion was accomplished in all sheep, and no surgical complications were observed. In the clinical study, operation time, blood loss, and duration of hospitalization were comparable between 2 groups. Using the less-invasive approach decreased the length of incision, 3-day postoperative visual analogue scale score, postoperative independent standing, and narcotic-dependent duration. No surgical complications were observed in either group.
2:::Using mixed-effects latent growth curve modeling with time since diagnosis as a fixed effect, age-adjusted standardized measures of working memory, processing speed, executive function, and attention were obtained and repeated about one and two years later. A subsample was tested for academic achievement at the end of treatment. .
4:::Subclinical carotid atherosclerosis was associated with worse cognition among those at higher risk for Alzheimer disease. Interventions targeting early stages of atherosclerosis may modify cognitive aging.
3:::There were no statistically significant group differences in any of the measures of daily physical activity (P > 0.290) or between days of follow-up (P > 0.155). Overall, the median participant had 3.50 hours (interquartile range, 2.85-4.81 hours) of upright time, and participants showed wide variation in all outcomes of daily physical activity.
2:::We enrolled English speaking patients, aged ≥ 65 years, who presented to the ED of an urban level one trauma center with a fall or fall related injury and discharged home. During subjects initial visits to the ED, we screened and enrolled patients, gathered patient demographics and provided them with a flyer for a Matter of Balance course. Sixty-days post enrollment, we conducted a phone follow-up interview to collect information on post-fall behaviors including information regarding the efforts to engage family and the primary care provider, enroll in a falls prevention program, assess patients' attitudes towards falling and experiences with any subsequent falls.'
4:::Perioperative administration of 5% dextrose in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery can reduce PONV significantly and even if PONV occurs, the quantity of rescue antiemetics to combat PONV is also reduced significantly.
3:::From 2005-2014, 18,935 (26.3%) eligible patients had CRT in place, implanted, or prescribed. The majority were male (60.0%) and white (61.9%). CRT utilization increased during the study period (P = .0002) especially in the early period. Women were less likely to receive CRT, and this difference increased over time (interaction P = .0037) despite greater mortality risk reduction (interaction P = .0043). Black patients were less likely than white patients to have CRT throughout the study period (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.79; 95% CI 0.74-0.85). Patients with CRT implanted during the index hospitalization had lower mortality (adjusted HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.59-0.71) and were less likely to be readmitted for HF than patients without CRT (adjusted HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.58-0.71).
2:::Six recent ICU ventilators were evaluated. Technical performances were assessed under two FIO2 levels (100%, 50%), three respiratory mechanics combinations (Normal: compliance [C] = 70 mL cmH2O(-1)/resistance [R] = 5 cmH2O L(-1) s(-1); Restrictive: C = 30/R = 10; Obstructive: C = 120/R = 20), four exponential levels of leaks (from 0 to 12.5 L min(-1)) and three levels of inspiratory effort (P0.1 = 2, 4 and 8 cmH2O), using an automated test lung. Ergonomics were evaluated by 20 ICU physicians using a global and comprehensive model involving physiological response to stress measurements (heart rate, respiratory rate, tidal volume variability and eye tracking), psycho-cognitive scales (SUS and NASA-TLX) and objective tasks completion.
4:::Despite similar technical performance, some ICU ventilators exhibit low ergonomics performance and a high risk of misusage.
3:::This population mean aged 47.63 years included 52.2% females and 58.2% non-smokers. Following DNA separation and genotyping, 65.7% of patients were homozygous carriers of the IL-6 - 572G; 49.3% were carriers of the IL-10 -592A- allele (AA and CA genotypes); and 35.8% carried SCP genotypes for both polymorphisms. The clinical parameters after therapy were not associated with the genotype status. The multiple logistic regression analysis did not show any statistically significant association between the genotypes and the variables tested.
1:::To investigate the predictive role of Intravoxel Incoherent Motion Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (IVIM-DWI) parameters on cervical nodal response to chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
3:::The annual increase in both patellar and trochlear cartilage thickness was 0.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6, 1.0) and 0.6% (0.3, 0.9), for adolescent males and females respectively; the longitudinal gain in patellar and trochlear tAB was 1.3% (1.1, 1.5) and 0.5% (0.2, 0.8), and 1.6% (1.1, 2.2) and 0.8% (0.3, 0.7) for adolescent males and females, respectively (no significant between-sex differences). Mature athletes showed smaller gains in tAB, and loss of <1% of cartilage thickness annually. While no significant sex-differences existed in adolescent patellar T2 changes, mature males gained significantly greater T2 than mature females (p=0.002-0.013).
4:::Patellar and trochlear cartilage thickness and tAB were observed to increase in young athletes in late adolescence, without significant differences between sexes. Mature athletes displayed patellar cartilage loss (and T2 increases in mature males), potentially reflecting degenerative changes.
2:::The case group comprised 470 patients with PVVs, and the control group included 269 individuals without a history of chronic venous disease. All cases and controls were ethnic Russians. Genotypes were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction allelic discrimination. Association was studied by logistic regression analysis.
3:::RFA was performed with the double puncture technique on, collectively, 10 great saphenous veins, 5 small saphenous veins, and 5 anterior accessory saphenous veins. Mean preoperative Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology score was 4.38 ± 1.6. Three limbs required prepuncture because of difficulty in advancing the catheter cephalad through tortuosity and focal obstruction after failure with techniques such as a guidewire, a guide catheter, and manual compression with ultrasound guidance. Ten limbs received planned double prepuncture for multiple adjacent incompetent veins, for which venipuncture and cannulation of the second target vein would be difficult after tumescent application to the first vein. Postoperative ultrasound demonstrated successful closure of all target veins in which the double prepuncture technique was used. One patient had a deep venous thrombosis (7.7%) that resolved without complications.
4:::Iliac vein stents placed for nonthrombotic iliac vein compression had statistically higher patency than those placed for venous thrombosis, with few stent failures, all occurring within 6 months. Iliac vein stents placed for venous thrombosis continued with stent failure after 6 months and may benefit from extended surveillance.
2:::This analysis used Pan American Health Organizations TRIVAC model (version 2.0) to examine nationwide introduction of two-dose rotavirus vaccination in 2017, compared to no vaccination. Three mortality scenarios (low, high, and midpoint) were assessed. Benefits and costs were examined from the societal perspective over ten successive birth cohorts with a 3% discount rate. Model inputs were locally acquired and complemented by internationally validated estimates.'
3:::Membership in AM and IMAST increased from 820 in 2003 to 1,323 in 2016. Attendance at the AM has increased, whereas attendance at IMAST has declined, even after adjusting for membership size. Trends in participation were highly influenced by location. Participation by attendees from the host continent, and especially the host country, is generally high. The negative impact of distant meetings is profoundly seen with North Americans, whereas the positive impact of a nearby meeting was mostly clearly demonstrated by South Americans. Although SRS AM overlapped with holidays in China, Japan, or Korea nearly 50% of the time, this did not influence participation by delegates from these countries.
2:::We used the difference in restricted mean survival time (RMST) between DPP-4 inhibitors and placebo to evaluate the risk of cardiovascular events, including hospitalization for heart failure associated with DPP-4 inhibitors. Three randomized clinical trials with cardiovascular events as a primary end point-EXAMINE (alogliptin), SAVOR-TIMI 53 (saxagliptin), and TECOS (sitagliptin)-were reevaluated by estimating the RMSTs for the DPP-4 inhibitors and placebo based on the reconstructed individual patient data for each time-to-event outcome from publicly available information.
3:::Two of the observers were very experienced general autopsy pathologists, one was a first-year pathology resident on his first rotation on the autopsy service, and the fourth observer was a highly experienced cardiovascular pathologist. Interobserver reliability was assessed by determination of the intraclass correlation coefficient. The degrees of agreement for two H&E- and Movat-stained sections of the LADs from each of 10 decedents were 0.874 and 0.899, respectively, indicating strong interobserver agreement. On the average, the mean visual scores were ~8% less than the morphometric assessment (52.7 vs. 60.2), respectively.
4:::Astrocytes attenuate propofol-induced neurotoxicity through BDNF-mediated cell survival pathway suggesting multiple neuroprotective strategies such as administration of BDNF, astrocyte-conditioned medium, decreasing mitochondrial fission, or inhibition of GSK3β.
2:::Data are derived from three independent, German population-based, prospective studies: the control sample of BiDirect (N = 966), the second follow-up of SHIP (N = 2333), and a subsample of SHIP-Trend (N = 1269). RLS was assessed with questions based on the RLS minimal criteria. ABI was measured with an automated method in BiDirect and with Doppler ultrasound in both SHIP studies. An ABI score below 0.9 was indicative of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Co-morbidities, medications and behavioural factors were self-reported. Additional measurements included body mass index and haemoglobin from blood serum. For BiDirect, a follow-up with identical methodology was performed after a median of 2.5 years.
3:::Latent class analysis indicated six distinct sleep quality classes in children, namely good sleep, moderate sleep quality, mild sleep disturbances, short sleep, long sleep, and disordered sleep. In general, the disordered sleep and minor sleep disturbance classes had poorer HRQOL, which worsened over time. The long sleep and moderate sleep quality classes also showed some decreases in HRQOL over time.
4:::Limitations in the available literature prevent firm conclusions from being reached about the relative economic merits of the various approaches to the prevention of PIs. The authors review revealed a need for additional high-quality studies that adhere to commonly used standards of both currently utilized and emerging ways to prevent hospital-acquired PIs.'
3:::MTHFR and MTR mRNA levels were higher while protein levels were lower, and MTR CpG sites were hypermethylated in the preterm group, as compared with the term group. Methylated CpG sites were negatively associated with maternal plasma vitamin B12 levels.
2:::CT-scan slices of 228 maxillary sinuses (from 144 men and 144 women) were studied. The maximum height, maximum anterior-posterior diameter, maximum width, and maximum distance between the sinuses were measured in both sexes. Our participants were divided into three age groups of 20-34, 35-49, and over 50 to compare the recorded measurements in different age groups.
3:::Most patients were prescribed at least one opioid medication (57%; n = 1,020). A significant interaction and main effects of pain intensity and pain catastrophizing on opioid prescription were noted (P < 0.04). Additive modeling revealed sex differences in the relationship between pain catastrophizing, pain intensity, and opioid prescription, such that opioid prescription became more common at lower levels of pain catastrophizing for women than for men.
4:::The association of dementia or cognitive impairment was significantly higher in the patients who were on statin therapy compared to the patients who were not on a statin.
2:::In total, 349 outpatients on treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (131 men and 218 women; mean age ± standard deviation: 65 ± 11 years) with no history of cardiovascular events, including ischemic stroke, were enrolled. The whole blood passage time (WBPT) as a marker of hemorheology and the PI of CCA were measured using commercial devices, and their relationships to various clinical parameters were examined.
3:::A significant positive correlation was observed between WBPT and the PI of CCA (r = 0.49, P < 0.001). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that patients with high WBPT (≥70 s) had significantly higher risk (odds ratio: 5.2; 95% confidence interval: 2.4 - 9.2; P < 0.001) of being detected with a high PI of CCA (≥ 2) than those with low WBPT (≤ 52.0 s).
3:::More than half of pediatric nurses had missed care on their previous shift. On average, pediatric nurses missed 1.5 necessary care activities. Missed care was more common in poor versus better work environments (1.9 vs 1.2; P < .01). For 9 of 12 nursing activities, the prevalence of missed care was significantly higher in the poor environments (P < .05). In regression models that controlled for nurse, nursing unit, and hospital characteristics, the odds that a nurse missed care were 40% lower in better environments and increased by 70% for each additional patient.
4:::MHT may cause non-allergic rhinitis in postmenopausal women. Age and obesity may also affect the occurrence of non-allergic rhinitis in postmenopausal women.
3:::Internal consistency reliability was acceptable for the total and domain scores at Baseline and Exit (Cronbachs α was 0.92 and 0.94 at Baseline and Exit, respectively, for the total score). Test-retest reliability was demonstrated (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.7) for total score and the Activity and Impacts domains. Convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated with measures associated or not associated with respiratory-related health status. Known groups validity based on baseline FEV1% predicted, Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-5 score, exacerbations and eosinophil counts was demonstrated for the SGRQ total and domain scores. Responses to therapy based on clinician-rated response, patient-rated response, ACQ-5 change score and exacerbations generally correlated with improvements in SGRQ scores.'
2:::The expression levels of miR-200c-5p and MAD2L1 in HCC tissues, adjacent tissues as well as HCC cell lines were detected by RT-qPCR or Western blot. The interaction between miR-200c-5p and MAD2L1 was verified by dual luciferase reporter gene system. Transfection was performed to manipulate the expression of miR-200c-5p and MAD2L1 in HCCLM3 cells. Colony formation, MTT, wound healing and Transwell assays were applied to measure the cell proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC, besides, flow cytometry analysis was also conducted to evaluate HCC cell cycle and apoptosis.
4:::Through the orthotopic implantation technique described, we demonstrate a highly reproducible model that recapitulates both local and systemic aspects of human PC.
3:::Fifty-six patients were identified; 26 (46%) of the 56 patients experienced partial response, 24 (43%) of 56 experienced stable disease, and 6 (11%) of 56 experienced progression of disease. O-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase status was available for 36 tumors. For tumors with partial response, 10 (67%) of 15 were MGMT deficient, and 5 (33%) of 15 were MGMT intact. For tumors with stable disease, 7 (47%) of 15 were MGMT deficient, and 8 (53%) of 15 were MGMT intact. For tumors with progression of disease, 3 (50%) of 6 were MGMT deficient, and 3 (50%) of 6 were MGMT intact.
2:::A systematic search of the literature was conducted for perioperative mortality risk prediction models for patients with AAA published since 2006. PRISMA guidelines were used; quality was appraised, and data were extracted and interpreted following the CHARMS guidelines.
4:::Safety was excellent during all DQRF procedures and over the 12 months following the end of the treatment sessions. VLQ, PISQ-12 and SSQ scores (women with vaginal laxity), VAS self-evaluation of VVA/GSM symptoms and overall satisfaction with sexual life (women with VVA/GSM symptoms) improved rapidly, reaching almost normal levels by the last DQRF session and suggesting rapid, but also persistent, vaginal rejuvenation in both indications. A late tendency to some slight deterioration in women treated for vaginal laxity suggests such women might benefit from new DQRF treatments 6 to 9 months after the previous cycle.
3:::Among the 1011 patients of the primary cohort, 631 (62.4%) were admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis (55%) or septic shock (45%). Among them, 210 (33.3%) patients received a median of 2 [interquartile 1-3] packed red cells during the first 48 h. Hemoglobin levels were lower in transfused patients at days 1 and 2 and became similar to those of non-transfused patients at day 3. Early RBC transfusion was more likely in patients with myeloid neoplasms and neutropenia. Transfused patients displayed more severe presentations as assessed by higher admission SOFA scores and blood lactate levels and the further requirements for organ failure supports. RBC transfusion within the first two days was associated with higher day 7 (20.5 vs. 13.3%, p = 0.02), in-ICU (39 vs. 25.2%, p < 0.001) and in-hospital (51 vs. 36.6%, p < 0.001) mortality rates. RBC transfusion remained independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality in multivariate logistic regression (OR 1.52 [1.03-2.26], p = 0.03) and propensity score-adjusted (OR 1.64 [1.05-2.57], p = 0.03) analysis.
2:::A 6-year prospective study (May 2009-March 2015) in the medical ICU of an 850-bed university-affiliated hospital was conducted.
3:::Overall, the prevalence of ideal health behaviours was low; non-smoking (60.9% ideal), body mass index (76.8%), physical activity (62.1%), and diet (1.7%). The prevalence of ideal health factors was; total cholesterol (65.8%), blood pressure (62.0%) and plasma glucose (88.8%).
4:::The low prevalence of iCVH behaviours, especially diet and physical activity, identified in European adolescents is likely to influence later cardiovascular health which strongly motivates efforts to increase ideal health behaviours in this population.
2:::MBP was chronically administered to mice in their drinking water for 3 wk, and body weight, water intake, and bone mineral density were measured. Additionally, plasma bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b, and ghrelin concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To examine the direct effect of MBP on ghrelin secretion, gastric tissue culture and primary mucosal cells were stimulated by MBP.
3:::We found significant differences in the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale between patients who had and had not received respite admission. Qualitative analysis of the data indicated that respite admission was a contributory factor in continuing and stabilizing home care. Limited provision of social services and hospital care quality were barriers to respite admission.
1:::The aim of this study was to analyze the feasibility and diagnostic performance of F-FDG PET/MR compared with F-FDG PET/CT in a cohort of pediatric histiocytosis patients with regard to image quality, lesion detection, and FDG quantification.
4:::MAP2K6-FP enhanced the sensitiveness of paclitaxel for ovarian cancer via inducing autophagy.
2:::Using National HIV Behavioral Surveillance data from 2008, 2011, and 2014, we assessed trends in self-reported syphilis testing and diagnoses in the past 12 months among MSM. We calculated percentages of syphilis screening and diagnosis by selected characteristics for each year. Trends were assessed using Poisson regression models with generalized estimation equations. Analysis of syphilis diagnosis was limited to participants who reported syphilis screening.
3:::The sample comprised 500, 514, and 525 participants in 2005, 2009, and 2012, respectively. Significant (P < 0.05) linear trends in risk behaviors included a decline in unsafe syringe sources (60.8%, 31.3%, 46.7%; RR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.92), an increase in all syringes from syringe exchanges or pharmacies (35.4%, 67.5%, 50.3%; RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.22), and an increase in condomless vaginal or anal sex (53.6%, 71.2%, 70.3%; RR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.19). Receptive syringe sharing (21.4%, 27.0%, 25.1%), sharing drug preparation equipment (45.4%, 43.4%, 46.7%), and having ≥2 sex partners (51.2%, 44.0%, 50.7%) were stable. Although HIV seroprevalence declined (18.1%, 12.5%, 12.2%), HCV seroprevalence was high (68.2%, 75.8%, 67.1%). In multivariate analysis, adjusting for sample characteristics significantly associated with time, linear time trends remained significant, and the decline in HIV seroprevalence gained significance (adjusted RR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.91, P = 0.003).
2:::Consecutive inclusions in the context of a multidisciplinary consultation centered on disability of the hand with collection of clinical data [cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF), history of trophic disorders of ischemic origin, peripheral pulse palpation, Allen maneuver the upper (UL) and lower limbs (LL)], and hemodynamic data (flow recorded by Doppler in radial, ulnar, anterior and posterior tibial arteries, and measurement of systolic indices ankles).
3:::A total of 811 brain metastases received RT in 119 geriatric patients. The median overall survival from the diagnosis of brain metastases was 4.3 months for the patients undergoing WBRT and 14.4 months for the patients undergoing SRS. On multivariate analysis, WBRT was associated with worse overall survival in this cohort of geriatric patients (odds ratio [OR] 3.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-7.0, P<.0001) and age ≥80 years was not. WBRT was associated with significantly greater rates of any grade 1 to 4 toxicity (OR 7.5, 95% CI 1.6-33.3, P=.009) and grade 2 to 4 toxicity (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.0-8.1, P=.047) on multivariate analysis. Elderly and very elderly patients did not have significantly different statistically acute toxicity rates when stratified by age.
4:::Comorbid symptoms in BD tend to cohere into Internalizing and Externalizing disorders, which could simplify research and treatment on comorbidity in BD.
3:::Patients who took medication more than once a day were more likely to comply with times of taking medication (p = .009); people using polytherapy were more likely to forget to take their medication (p < .001). Married persons missed a dose of a drug considerably less often than other patients (p = .001). The youngest patients were the least likely to miss drug doses (p = .026). The oldest patients (p = .003) and divorced patients also were more likely to miss doses (p = .003).
2:::We analyzed data for 240 respondents located in the United States who were recruited online. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of 3 conditions, where they viewed a PSA with hope appeals, fear appeals, or non-emotional appeals. Respondents then answered a series of questions about their attitudes about HIV/AIDS; testing behavior; engagement with HIV/AIDS-related people, organizations, and issues; and HIV/AIDS knowledge. We then performed MANOVA analyses and Pearson correlations.
3:::The MDQ items were best captured by a two-factor structure consisting of dimensions labeled Positive Activation and Negative Activation. These two factors showed very different patterns of associations with personality, other psychopathology, and ratings of significant impairment, the last of which is a requirement for a positive MDQ screen using traditional scoring methods.
4:::This research confirms there is very little integration of HIE into health systems readmissions initiatives. There is a great opportunity to achieve population health targets using the HIE infrastructure. Hospitals should consider partnering with primary care clinics to implement multifaceted transitions of care programs to significantly reduce 30-day readmission rates.
3:::Bland-Altman analysis showed the average bias between VERIS HIV-1 Assay and COBAS HIV-1 Test, RealTime HIV-1 Assay, and VERSANT HIV-1 Assay to be 0.28, 0.39, and 0.61 log10 cp/mL, respectively. Bias at low end levels below 1000cp/mL showed predicted bias to be <0.3 log10 cp/mL for VERIS HIV-1 Assay versus COBAS HIV-1 Test and RealTime HIV-1 Assay, and <0.5 log10cp/mL versus VERSANT HIV-1 Assay. Analysis on 174 specimens tested with the 0.175mL volume VERIS HIV-1 Assay and COBAS HIV-1 Test showed average bias of 0.39 log10cp/mL. Patient monitoring results using VERIS HIV-1 Assay demonstrated similar viral load trends over time to all comparators.
2:::Here, we tracked the behavioral performances of 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-month-old AD mice and investigated the expression level of Drebrin in their hippocampi. A Pearson correlation analysis between Drebrin levels and behavioral data was performed. Subsequently, 2-month-old AD mice were injected with rAAV-zsGreen-Dbn1 vector, composing the APP/PS1-Dbn1 group, and sex- and age-matched AD mice were injected with rAAV-tdTomato vector to serve as the control group. All mice were conducted behavioral tests and molecular detection 6 months later.
4:::Immunophenotyping by multicolor flow cytometry is useful to evaluate immune status and contributes to the diagnosis and management of patients with PIDDs.
3:::One hundred and twenty-six participants were available for longitudinal analysis (64 intervention and 62 control). Annual WMH volume increase in milliliter was similar for intervention (mean=0.73, SD=0.84) and control (mean=0.70, SD=0.59) participants (adjusted mean difference, -0.08 mL; 95% confidence interval, -0.30 to 0.15; P=0.50). Analyses suggested greater intervention effects with increasing baseline WMH volumes (P for interaction=0.03). New lacunar infarcts developed in 6 (9%) intervention and 2 (3%) control participants (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-12.1; P=0.36).
2:::A hypothesis-testing, prospective longitudinal, case-control study assessed exposure to Hg from Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines (TM-HepB) among cases diagnosed with atypical autism (n=164) and controls (n=15,216). Automated medical records for subjects born from 1991 to 2000 and continuously enrolled in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) database were examined.
3:::The expression of miR-152 was down-regulated while the expression of DNMT1 was up-regulated in both glioma tissue and cell lines. MiR-152 was hypermethylated and its expression was negatively correlated with DNMT in glioma cell lines. DNMT1 knockdown promoted the expression of miR-152, however, DNMT1 overexpression suppressed the expression of miR-152. MiR-152 overexpression promoted glioma cell apoptosis while miR-152 knockdown promoted cell proliferation. MiR-152 targets Runx2 to regulate its expression, Runx2 overexpression abolished the effects of miR-152 overexpression.
2:::This was a prospective observational cohort study of women at 37 0/7 to 41 6/7 weeks of gestation without pre-existing medical complications who presented to our hospital-based triage unit with symptoms of labor and underwent a standardized evaluation. Women diagnosed as having false labor with a live singleton fetus in cephalic presentation without a prior cesarean delivery and sent home were compared with a group of similar women diagnosed to be in spontaneous labor. Women with hypertension, diabetes, and known fetal malformations were excluded. Using a perinatal composite outcome of respiratory insufficiency, intraventricular hemorrhage, culture-proven sepsis, Apgar score 3 or less at 5 minutes, phototherapy, and perinatal death, we tested the noninferiority of being sent home compared with being admitted for labor. The relationship of cervical dilatation to the time interval from discharge home to delivery was also analyzed.
4:::Oral antibiotic preparation alone significantly reduced surgical site infection, anastomotic leak, postoperative ileus, and major morbidity after elective colorectal surgery. A combined regimen of oral antibiotics and mechanical bowel preparation offered no superiority when compared with oral antibiotics alone for these outcomes. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A358.
3:::A total of 151 eligible patients were identified, and 142 patients (94.0%) participated after a median of 19 months from surgery. Bowel dysfunction was observed in 71.1% (101/142) of patients, with 44.4% (63/142) reporting severe dysfunction. Symptoms of urgency and clustering were found to be major disturbances. Regression analysis identified preoperative long-course radiotherapy (p < 0.001) and a lower-third tumor (p = 0.002) independently associated with severe bowel dysfunction. Irradiated patients with a lower-third tumor (OR = 14.06; p < 0.001) or thickening of the rectal wall (OR = 11.09; p < 0.001) had a markedly increased risk of developing severe dysfunction.
4:::The appearance of microbes on various body surface areas determines the overall health status of the individual in significant manner. The change in composition of microbioma in pregnant woman is well known. It was believed that the placenta and the body of the newborn is sterile environment. Modern diagnostic methods proved the presence of microorganisms inside the fetoplacentar unit without the signs of inflammation. Mutual interaction between the immune system of the mother, microbioma and immune system of the newborn can decrease the risk of serious obstetrical syndromes as well as define the lifelong health status of the newborn. The risk can be decreased by the administration of probiotics during the pregnancy.
3:::Substance use marginally predicted increased odds of rearrest at one wave, and rearrest significantly (p < .05) predicted increased odds of substance use at another. As such, the results provide limited evidence for a degree of lagged mutual causation; associations vary over the reentry process and are complicated by other realities of life after prison. A key finding is that both behaviors are more consistently influenced by other factors, such as service needs and instrumental and emotional supports.
1:::To evaluate the quality of reduction, clinical outcomes and complications of associated both column acetabular fractures with posterior wall involvement that are treated through single ilioinguinal approach and fixation of posterior wall by lag screws only.
2:::A retrospective review of medical records and radiographs following ESF placement was performed.
3:::We had 402 RA patients participate in the study (response rate, 52%). Of the patients randomized to the Pharm Booklet, 30.6% elected to initiate etanercept. Only 14.6% and 14.0% of patients who reviewed the LONG DA or SHORT DA choose to take etanercept (χ2 = 15.7; P < 0.001). Patients who reviewed the LONG DA or SHORT DA had a greater increase in knowledge about etanercept than those who reviewed the Pharm Booklet. There was no difference in decisional conflict among the groups. A logistic regression model explained 44.2% (R(2) = 0.442) of patient choice to intensify therapy by initiating etanercept. The strongest predictor of choice to intensify therapy were beliefs about etanercepts ability to improve symptoms (OR = 2.56, 96%CI [1.71, 3.80]), and its use by others like the respondent (OR = 2.24, 95%CI [1.49, 3.35]). Mediation analysis confirmed the presence of a partial mediating effect of decision support on patients' intent to take etanercept (OR = 0.59, 95%CI [0.39, 0.89]).'
2:::We reviewed the charts and SABR plans from patients treated for T1-T2N0 peripheral non-small-cell lung cancer between 2009 and 2015. The CW structure was created through a 3-cm expansion of the lung. The median dose delivered to the planning target volume was 60 Gy. SABR was delivered in three fractions for patients with CW V30 < 30 cm(3). If the CW V30 exceeded 30 cm(3), five fractions were used, and the plan was optimized based on CW V37 (biologically equivalent to the V30 of three-fraction plans).
4:::The present study is the first to quantify the FOV of elbow arthroscopy. The majority of the anterior and posterior humerus articular surface can be seen through standard portals. The limitations in FOV are primarily confined to the radial head and trochlear notch.
3:::Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. In the majority of studies, lesser tuberosity osteotomy (LTO) techniques had greater load to failure and less cyclic displacement compared to subscapularis tenotomy or peel methods. LTO repairs with sutures wrapped around the humeral stem demonstrated superior biomechanical outcomes compared to techniques using only a tension band. In terms of load to failure, the strongest repair of any study was a dual-row fleck LTO using four sutures wrapped around the stem.
2:::Aged male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and were randomly selected to receive either vehicle or MRE-269 (0.25 mg/kg) intravenously starting at 4.5 hours post ischemia. Accelerating rotarod and adhesive removal tests were conducted before and at 3, 7, 14, and 21 days after stroke. Infarct volume was quantified by magnetic resonance imaging at 48 hours and 21 days post middle cerebral artery occlusion. In parallel experiments, cerebral cortex samples from stroke and nonstroke sides from vehicle- and MRE-269-treated groups were collected at 18 hours post middle cerebral artery occlusion for molecular biology analyses.
4:::Intussusception secondary to PLPs tends to exhibit recurrence. There are various types of intussusception secondary to PLPs. It is necessary to improve auxiliary examinations to identify the etiology and avoid intraoperative omission. Surgical reduction of intussusception secondary to PLPs is the preferred clinical management.
3:::During the 698 946 person-years of follow-up, we documented a total of 2738 incident cases of stroke, including 1007 hemorrhagic strokes (747 intraparenchymal and 260 subarachnoid hemorrhages) and 1721 ischemic strokes (1206 nonembolic and 515 embolic infarctions). Individuals in the second or third metabolic equivalents of task-hours per day quartile had the lowest risks of total stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75-0.93), intraparenchymal hemorrhage (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.97), subarachnoid hemorrhage (HR, 0.78; CI, 0.55-1.11), and nonembolic infarction (HR, 0.78; CI, 0.67-0.92), whereas those in the fourth quartile had the lowest risk of embolic infarction (HR, 0.76; CI, 0.59-0.97). Cubic spline graphs revealed a steep decrease in stroke risk (30% risk reduction) from the lowest level to a plateau at 5 to 10 metabolic equivalents of task-hours per day (50th percentile). The associations of total physical activity level with hemorrhage stroke showed U or J shape, which were because of vigorous-intensity activities, whereas the association with ischemic stroke showed L shape.
2:::The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for patients ≤18 years diagnosed with PedsSNM between the years of 1973 and 2013. Data on incidence, tumor characteristics, and survival were analyzed.
3:::A total of 280 (2.8%) patients developed secondary post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage. Patients who developed hemorrhage tended to be older (median (interquartile range) 7 (4-11) vs. 5 (3-8) years), p < 0.001) and had undergone tonsillectomy more often for chronic tonsillitis but less often for tonsillar or adenotonsillar hypertrophy or sleep disturbances. Dexamethasone dose was significantly lower on average in patients who experienced secondary post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage (median (interquartile range) 0.19 (0.14, 0.23) mg/kg vs. 0.21 (0.17, 0.30), p < 0.001). Multivariable modeling demonstrated that the dose of dexamethasone was not significantly associated with post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage after adjustment for age.
4:::Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgeries in the US. However, the internet information readily available to patients varies in quality. Additionally, much of the information is above the recommended grade level for comprehension by the public. By being aware of what information patients are reading online, physicians can better explain treatments and address misunderstandings. Physicians may consider using similar methods to test the readability for their own resources for patient education.
2:::Between February 2010 and January 2012, 17 consecutive patients with Pauwels type-3 vertical femoral neck fractures were treated with the modified DHS loaded with autologous bone graft. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 24 months (range, 24-36 months). Surgical details, operative and postoperative complications, the rates of nonunion and osteonecrosis and the Harris hip score were evaluated.
3:::Lack of visualisation of the left and right vestibular aqueducts was identified as statistically significant amongst Ménières disease patients (left, p = 0.0001, odds ratio = 0.02; right, p = 0.0004, odds ratio = 0.03). Both vestibular aqueducts were of abnormal size in the Ménière's disease group, albeit with left-sided significance (left, p = 0.008, odds ratio = 10.91; right, p = 0.49, odds ratio = 2.47).'
3:::Our results indicate that inflammatory indices [C-reactive protein (CRP), platelets] decreased in the taurine group in pre-exercise, post-supplementation and post-exercise, post-supplementation as compared with pre-exercise, pre-supplementation ( p < 0.05) whereas these indices increased in pre-exercise, post-supplementation and post-exercise, post-supplementation as compared with pre-exercise, pre-supplementation in the placebo group ( p < 0.05). Our results also show that atherogenic indices [Castellis Risk Index-I (CRI-I), Castelli's Risk Index-II (CRI-II) and Atherogenic Coefﬁcient (AC)] decreased in the taurine group in pre-exercise, post-supplementation and post-exercise, post-supplementation as compared with pre-exercise, pre-supplementation ( p < 0.05). No such changes were noted in the placebo group ( p > 0.05).'
4:::GSAs positively influence the physical, social, emotional, and academic well-being of LGBTQ young people and their allies. School administrators and staff are positioned to advocate for comprehensive GSAs. Study findings offer insights about the mechanisms by which GSAs benefit youth health and well-being.
2:::A community-based intervention provided administrators and teachers with a training on evidence-based public health and then collaborated with them to identify and implement environmental (walking track) and local school policy interventions (brain breaks). The evaluation included conducting in-depth interviews and SOPLAY observations to assess the facilitators and barriers and impact of the dissemination of environmental and policy changes.
1:::Blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage aggravates perihematomal edema, and edema volume predicts prognosis independently. But the BBB permeability at the late stage of acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients is uncertain. We aimed to assess the BBB permeability of spontaneous basal ganglia ICH using computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) and investigates its relationship with hematoma and perihematomal edema volume.
3:::Ranked results automatically generated by the knowledge graph were highly consistent with results from the manual literature review. Out of 222 reference compounds, 163 (73%) ranked in the top 2000, with 547 out of the 644 (85%) weight points assigned to the reference compounds. For reference compounds that were not in the top of the list, an extensive error analysis has been performed. When evaluating the overall performance, we obtained a ROC-AUC of 0.974.
4:::The presentation of reconfiguration reports alone is not enough to convince communities of the case for change. Genuine, ongoing and inclusive engagement offers the best opportunity to address community concerns about reconfiguration.
2:::A case-control study was performed in men who visited a single university hospital for a medical check-up between August 2003 and July 2016. Patients were classified in the case group according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Osteoporosis Criteria. The control group was created by matching patients according to age and check-up date. Lifestyle factors were evaluated by a self-assessment questionnaire. Multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to examine the association between lifestyle factors and male osteoporosis with age stratification at 50 years.
3:::The combinations of search terms resulted in a list of 3482 titles. Twenty-three studies finally met the inclusion criteria and were entered in the systematic review, comprising a total of 11,971 patients. The most common anatomical variations were pneumatization and sinus septa. The prevalence of maxillary sinus disease ranged from 7.5% to 66%. The most common pathological findings of the maxillary sinus were mucosal thickening, sinusitis and sinus opacification.
4:::Within the osimertinib AURA Phase I study, EGFR mutation testing across three centralized laboratories using the cobas(®) EGFR Mutation Test was feasible and successful, with strong concordance between local and central laboratory results, including for T790M. The cobas(®) EGFR Mutation Test has subsequently been approved as the companion diagnostic test for osimertinib in the USA and Japan.
3:::2,089 patients were matched, and cohorts were well balanced. Surgery was associated with longer survival for Stage I (median OS 38.6 months vs. 22.9 months, HR 0.62 95%CI 0.57-0.69, p<0.0001), but survival differences were attenuated for Stage II (median OS 23.4 months vs. 20.7 months, HR 0.84 95%CI 0.70-1.01, p=0.06) and IIIA (median OS 21.7 vs. 16.0 months, HR 0.71 95%CI 0.60-0.83, p <0.0001). In analyses by T and N stage, longer OS was observed in resected patients with stage T3/T4 N0 (median OS 33.0 vs. 16.8 months, p=0.008) and node positivity(N1+ 24.4 vs. 18.3 months p=0.03; N2+ 20.1 vs. 14.6 months p=0.007). In the subgroup analysis, 507 stage I/II patients receiving lobectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy were matched to patients receiving concurrent CRT. In this cohort, lobectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with significantly longer survival (median OS 48.6 vs. 28.7 months, p<0.0001).
2:::The hepatocytes extracted from both normal rats and rats with ALF were assigned to control, acute injury, P13K agonist, and P13K inhibitor groups. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were used as part of this investigation to detect the expression of PI3K/AKt/mTOR signaling pathway related-proteins (PI3K, AKt, mTOR), apoptosis related-proteins (Fas, Bax, Bcl-2), chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) marker proteins (LAMP-2A, HSC 70), p-PI3K, p-AKt, p-4E-BPI, and p-S6K. An MTT assay was used for analysis of cell proliferation after transfection. Flow cytometry is performed to detect the cell apoptosis.
3:::In comparison to the normal group, the model group showed enhanced positive rate of PI3K, AKt, mTOR, increased expression levels of PI3K, AKt, mTOR, Fas, Bax, p-PI3K, p-AKt, p-4E-BPI and p-S6K, reduced expression levels of Bcl-2, LAMP-2A and HSC 70. The results in vitro experiment: compared with the acute injury group, the PI3K agonist group showed elevated expression levels of PI3K, AKt, mTOR, Fas, Bax, p-PI3K, p-AKt, p-4E-BPI and p-S6K, decreased expression levels of Bcl-2, LAMP-2A and HSC 70, inhibited cell proliferation, more arrested cells in G1 stage, and promoted cell apoptosis. Opposing this, the P13K inhibitor group exhibited an opposite trend.
4:::Green vegetables, total FVI, and various aspects of PA showed protective effects regarding CRLDS. Therefore, the promotion of such lifestyles is likely to help prevent CRLDS in this population.
2:::We recruited 20 SVD with depressive symptoms (SVD+D), 20 SVD without depressive symptoms (SVD-D) and 16 healthy control (HC) individuals. Graph theory and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were applied to construct a structural network. We compared networks between groups, and examined the relationships between network properties, conventional measures of MRI, and depressive symptoms.
3:::Of 43 nurses approached, 28 completed the survey (65% response rate) of whom 6 were UFP attendants, 8 attended the TMCPM and 14 the MP. Those who had attended the UFP scored higher than the other two in all four domains; however, the crude between-group comparisons did not yield statistically significant results. Only after accounting for age, gender, teaching setting and prior work experience, the multivariable model showed that undertaking the UFP was likely to increase perceptions of work-readiness by 1.4 points (95% CI 0.11-2.69), P=0.03). The UFP was superior to the other two placement models.
2:::We used the data from the Population Study of ChINese Elderly in Chicago (PINE), a population-based survey of community-dwelling Chinese older adults in the Greater Chicago area. Grandparents with grandchildren younger than 16 years old were selected for present study (N = 2,775). Negative binominal regression and logistic regression models were used to test the relationships of grandparent caregiving time and psychological well-being measured by depressive symptoms and quality of life.
3:::Grandparents reported an average of 11.96 hours a week for caring for grandchildren. Caregiving time had a significantly negative association with depressive symptoms, but not with quality of life. The association between grandparent caregiving and depressive symptoms was moderated by the perception of caregiving burden. No moderating effect of caregiving pressure from adult children was found.
4:::More time spending on grandparent caregiving is generally beneficial to Chinese American grandparents psychological well-being, thus supporting role enhancement theory. However, this association depends on whether this experience is a burden to the grandparents, therefore role strain theory is also supported. Policies and programs are discussed to address the grandparenting experience in the Chinese American older adults.'
1:::To analyze the changes in ganglion cell complex and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, in central macular thickness and choroidal thickness on spectral domain optical coherence tomography in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration treated with intravitreal ranibizumab injections.
3:::Only 16.5% of low-income (Medicaid-eligible) women consistently tracked GWG, as did 34.2% of not-low-income women. More highly educated, older, and white women were more likely to be consistent GWG trackers. Among not-low-income women, consistent GWG tracking was associated with 2.35 kg less GWG (95% CI: -3.23 to -1.46 kg; P < 0.0001) and a reduced risk of excessive GWG (RR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.89; P = 0.002).
2:::Twenty-six healthy men were recruited. Blood testosterone levels were measured before fMRI scanning. The participants were classified into two groups (high vs. low testosterone) according to their blood testosterone level (each group n = 13). The middle finger was immersed in a 50°C water bath (50°C, 30 s, five times) to induce identical noxious stimulation in all participants.
4:::NSE and s100B levels increase after bypass surgery and return below preoperative baseline levels by postoperative day seven. The levels of s100B were positively correlated with circulatory arrest time and negatively correlated with age at time of surgery. This finding may be supportive of pre-existing prenatal brain injury that could be enhanced by longer surgical times but also of some brain protection effect associated with longer wait until surgery.
3:::Both groups increased the distance covered in the 6MWT (FESG: 49.6m, 95% CI 15.9-83.3; FESPG: 41.5m, 95% CI 7.8-75.2), but without a difference between groups. There were significant between-group differences for quadriceps muscle strength (7.2kg, 95% CI 0.2-14.2) and muscle endurance (2.2 repetitions, 95% CI 1.0-3.4) in favor of the FESG.
2:::The design of the study is observational. The participants will be patients that are hospitalized in the cardiology departments, the intensive care units for cardiac and thoracic surgery, pulmonary medicine and medical oncology of the ""A.Gemelli"" hospital in Rome, Italy. The observers who will carry out the surveys will be students of the nursing degree course and the coordinators of the respective wards. The times recorded for each health care activity will be correlated with variables that are defined in the literature as the indicators of the complexity of care. The research protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the ""A. Gemelli"" Hospital in June 2015.
3:::Patients in PPEP-Pituitary reported improved mood after each session (except for session 1). In partners, mood only improved after the last three sessions. Patients reported higher self-efficacy at T1 (P = 0.016) which persisted up to T2 (P = 0.033), and less bother by mood problems directly after PPEP-Pituitary (P = 0.01), but more bother after six months (P = 0.001), although this increase was not different from baseline (P = 0.346). Partners in PPEP-Pituitary reported more vitality (P = 0.008) which persisted up to T2 (P = 0.034). At T2, partners also reported less anxiety and depressive symptoms (P ≤ 0.014).
4:::This pooled analysis suggests that the efficacy and safety of indacaterol treatment is similar between elderly and younger patients with COPD.
2:::Three patients with NTZ PML included in the Italian dataset of PML were treated with maraviroc. Their longitudinal clinical and radiological course was described in detail.
3:::Poor sleep was common in both samples (89% in the clinical range), which was characterised by low sleep efficiency (M=65.40%) and low total sleep time (M=6.05h). In regression analysis, sleep quality was negatively associated with FND-related functional impairment, accounting for 16% of the variance and remaining significant after the introduction of mood variables.
3:::High blood pressure, low socioeconomic status, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and family history of stroke were observed to be statistically significant risk factors for IS. Multivariable adjusted analysis demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between SNP 83 of PDE4D gene polymorphism and increasing odds of IS under the dominant model of inheritance (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.50; p value = 0.04) after adjustment of potential confounding variables. Stratified analysis on the basis of TOAST classification demonstrated a statistically significant association for increasing 2.73 times odds for developing large vessel disease stroke as compared to controls (OR, 2.73; 95% CI, 1.16 to 0.02; p value = 0.02). We did not find any significant association of SNPs (C87T and C45T) of the PDE4D gene with the risk of IS.
2:::A cross-sectional study involving three undergraduate PT classes in a single academic year was performed 1 week prior to final examinations. Current grade point average (GPA) and admission data were collected from administrative records. Additional data, collected using an online questionnaire, included the Perceived Stress Scale 10 (PSS), Scale for Assessing Academic Stress (SAAS), and selected sociodemographic variables. Regression analysis identified contributors to AA and to PS.
4:::Implementing a multifaceted intervention including sepsis e-alert with SRT was associated with earlier identification of sepsis, increase in compliance with sepsis resuscitation bundle and reduction in the need for mechanical ventilation and reduction in hospital mortality and LOS.
3:::miR-130a-3p expression was upregulated in CCLP-1-GRs and MzChA-1-GRs significantly more than in their parental cells. Transfection of the miR-130a-3p mimic into CCA cells increased gemcitabine resistance, and we detected PPARG as a target gene of miR-130a-3p. Furthermore, pioglitazone had a synergistic effect with gemcitabine and alleviated gemcitabine resistance of CCA GR cells. Moreover, clinical examination revealed that for patients who underwent adjuvant gemcitabine therapy, those who were PPARγ positive had significantly longer disease-free survival than those who were PPARγ negative (n = 5 and 11, respectively; p = 0.027).
2:::Using various tissue homogenates, we investigated the colonic organoid forming capacity under the TMDU protocol immediately adjacent to Ootanis 3D culture assembly in the same culture dish. Next, we examined whether the supernatant from the colon could be replaced by a colon homogenate. Finally, we identified the bioactive substances that were indispensable for efficient organoid culture using protein purification by three-step column chromatography and proteomic analysis with a quantitative nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).'
3:::Intramuscular temperature was colder in ICE (26.7±1.1°C) than CON (35.5±0.1°C) throughout the 4h recovery period (p<0.001). There were no differences in expression of PGC-1α, TFAM, NRF1, NRF2, or ERRα mRNA between ICE and CON after the 4h recovery period.
4:::Our findings give new insights on reward anticipation in BD. BD-I patients rated themselves as more risk avoidant and showed larger recruitment of the ACC rather than ventral striatum compared to controls during reward anticipation, possibly to down-regulate hyperactive limbic reward regions. This activation seems to be a consequence of rather than a vulnerability marker for the disorder.
2:::We used a retrospective cohort study design and EHR data from one center to examine the relationship of patient factors in 1 year (2013) and the likelihood of frequent ED use (≥2 visits) in the following year (2014), using bivariate and multivariable statistics. We applied and compared several machine-learning algorithms to predict frequent ED use, then selected a model based on accuracy, parsimony, and interpretability.
3:::We identified 2691 children. In bivariate analyses, future frequent ED use was associated with demographics, co-morbidities, insurance status, medication history, and use of healthcare resources. Machine learning algorithms had very good AUC (area under the curve) values [0.66-0.87], though fair PPV (positive predictive value) [48-70%] and poor sensitivity [16-27%]. Our final multivariable logistic regression model contained two variables: insurance status and prior ED use. For publicly insured patients, the odds of frequent ED use were 3.1 [2.2-4.5] times that of privately insured patients. Publicly insured patients with 4+ ED visits and privately insured patients with 6+ ED visits in a year had ≥50% probability of frequent ED use the following year. The model had an AUC of 0.86, PPV of 56%, and sensitivity of 23%.
4:::We demonstrated that such easy-to-use systems can permit pathologists to integrate a reliable EGFR/KRAS status in their initial pathologic report, and could be useful complementary tools to the current molecular diagnostic methods, with regard to prompt therapeutic management of lung cancer patients.
3:::In total, 1053 patients were included (mean age 74 ± 9 years, all men). Of these, 745 patients (70.8%) had been prescribed an antiplatelet agent and 787 (74.7%) a statin. Overall, only 666 patients (63.2%) were prescribed both a statin and antiplatelet. Two hundred and sixty eight patients (32.1%) were current smokers and the proportion of patients who continued to smoke decreased with age. Overall, only 401 patients (48.1%) were prescribed a statin, antiplatelet, and had stopped smoking. In the secondary analysis 38 AAA screening units (84% national coverage) replied. Thirty-one units (82%) suggest changes to the patients prescription; however, none monitor compliance with these recommendations or assess whether the general practitioner has been made aware of the AAA diagnosis or prescription advice.'
2:::Cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative sample of 8175 community-dwelling adults aged 50 and over from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) was undertaken. Multivariate adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess the association between MHD, smoking (current/past/never) and smoking-related diseases (respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, smoking-related cancers). A number of variables were employed to identify individuals with MHD, including prescribed medication, self-reported diagnoses and self-report scales.
3:::Only a fourth to a third of the total group showed improvement on the outcome variables. These patients had lower baseline anxiety, depression and kinesiophobia, and improved more on anxiety, depression and kinesiophobia. Physical well-being had a stronger effect on anxiety and depression than vice versa. Physical functioning predicted relative changes in kinesiophobia, while kinesiophobia predicted relative changes in pain-related disability.
4:::Increased Lp(a) levels were associated with increased risk of incident HF hospitalization. After excluding prevalent and incident myocardial infarction, the association was no longer significant. Lp(a) levels were not associated with arterial stiffness parameters.
2:::We conducted a retrospective, observational cohort study of consequtive patients with RCS treated with VA-ECMO at a single transplant center from March 2010 until August 2015. Overall, 148 patients underwent VA-ECMO for RCS (99 men, aged 56.6 ± 12.0 years; BSA, 1.85 ± 0.19). Patients were categorized based on VA-ECMO perfusion technique into PC-DP via femoral artery and SGP via axillary/femoral artery groups.
3:::The median duration of VA-ECMO support was 5 days (range, 8 hours-80 days). Hospital mortality (PC-DP group, 54.7%; SGP group, 64.4%; p=0.23) and overall ECMO survival (PC-DP group, 36.9%; SGP group, 32.2%; p=0.47) was similar between the groups. There were no significant between-group differences in the rate of acute limb ischemia (PC-DP group, 4/75, 5.3%; SGP group, 2/73, 2.7%; p=0.68). However, the rate of surgical/cannulation site bleeding (PC-DP, 9/75 (12%) vs SGP, 18/73 (24.7%), p=0.05) and hyperperfusion syndrome (PC-DP, 2/75 (2.7%) vs SGP, 22/73 (30.1%),p=0.001) were higher in the SGP group than in the PC-DP group.
3:::While ignoring the burden of dialysis sessions, GA returned schedules with slightly improved values of adequacy criteria (EKRc and std Kt/V), compared to the conventional regular uniform HD schedules. The optimized HD schedules also showed decreased TAC and TAD values compared to the conventional regular uniform HD schedules. It showed that frequent dialysis resulted in more effective treatment and higher fitness values. However, when burden was considered, less frequent dialysis schedules showed better fitness value.
4:::The proposed test setting designed to analyze the performance guarantees that the actual physiological variability of the cardiac system is reproduced. The use of the EMD-based block in noisy environment enables the identification of most patients with fatal arrhythmias.
2:::A new approach in seizure prediction is presented that includes a novel technique in feature extraction from EEG. The algorithm firsts creates an embedding space from EEG time series. Then it takes samples with most of the information using an optimized and data specific Poincare plane. In order to quantify small dynamics on the Poincare plane, based on the order of locations of Poincaré samples in the sequence, 64 fuzzy rules in each channel are defined. Features are extracted based on the frequency distribution of these fuzzy rules in each minute. Then features with higher variance are selected as ictal features and again reduced using PCA. Finally, in order to evaluate how these innovative features can increase the performance of the seizure prediction algorithm, the transition from interictal to preictal state is scored utilizing SVM.
3:::The total cost of delivering the FWB program for 66 participants was $182,588 ($2766 per participant), with 45% ($82,995) of costs classified as indirect (i.e., opportunity cost of participants time). Training cost could be further mitigated (∼30%) if offered on-site, in the community. The costs for offering the FWB program to a remotely located workforce were high, but not substantial when compared to the recruitment cost required to substitute a worker in remote settings.
2:::We followed Arksey and OMalley's methodological framework for conducting scoping reviews which entails setting research questions, selecting relevant studies, charting the data and synthesizing the results in a report.'
3:::Men had a younger age at onset and the first onset age, higher education compared to women in total patients and with or without residual symptoms group. Using regression analysis, it was found that gender was significantly statistically related to severity scores of SDS and had no correlation with Q-LES-Q-SF total scores. In the residual symptoms group, greater functional impairment was noted by men in the area of work and social life. Significant gender differences of mood, work and sexual life in quality of life were observed.
1:::The purposes of the present study are to assess whether different characteristics of oligodendrogliomas and astrocytic tumors are visible on MR imaging and to determine the added value of perfusion imaging in conventional MR imaging when differentiating oligodendrogliomas from astrocytic tumors.
4:::This multicenter longitudinal study found that 40% of ARDS survivors reported at least one post-discharge hospitalization during 12-month follow-up. Few patient- or ICU-related variables were associated with hospitalization; however, physical, psychiatric, and quality of life measures at 6-month follow-up were associated with subsequent hospitalization. Interventions to reduce post-ARDS morbidity may be important to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare utilization.
2:::We treated GLUTag cells from the mouse intestine L cell line with recombinant PANDER protein and hepatic overexpression of PANDER in an obese murine model.
3:::The analyses performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that the main secondary metabolites present in ESAH were phenolic compounds, such as caffeoylquinic acids (chlorogenic acid), dicaffeoylquinic acids and glycosylated flavonoids (quercetin glucoside and galactoside). ESAH did not induce any acute toxic effects and did not affect the urinary volume or renal excretion of electrolytes in Wistar rats. On the other hand, intraduodenal administration of ESAH induces a significant acute hypotensive effect. Previous treatment with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, methylene blue, or tetraethylammonium fully avoided the hypotensive effect of ESAH. All other parameters were not affected by treatment with ESAH.
4:::Clinicians might usefully (1) consider and discuss with patients how their psychosexual communication needs and information processing abilities may fluctuate across the cancer timeline; (2) initiate discussions about the consequences of treatment that extend beyond biological and mechanical aspects to include emotional and relational factors; (3) tailor communication to the dynamic mix of attributes that shape mens individual psychosexual needs, including their relationship status, sexual orientation, sexual motivations and values. Skills-based training in communication and psychosexual awareness may facilitate the proactive and permissive stance clinicians need to discuss sexual side effects with a heterogeneous group of patients.'
3:::91 mChRCC patients from 26 centres were included. Median follow-up from the date of first metastasis was 6.1 years (range: 0-13.9). Median OS was 37.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.4-46.8) from the diagnosis of metastatic disease. Among the 61 patients who received TT, 50 (82%) were treated with anti-angiogenic (AA) and 11 with mTOR inhibitors. Median TTF and OS in patients receiving a first line of AA was 8.7 months (95% CI: 5.2-10.9) and 22.9 months (95% CI: 17.8-49.2) versus 1.9 months (95% CI: 1.0-6.0) and 3.2 months (95% CI: 2.3-not evaluable) with mTOR inhibitors, respectively. A stratified log-rank test was used to compare AA and mTOR inhibitors TT, while controlling the effect of the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium risk group and no significant difference between AA and mTOR inhibitors was observed for TTF (p = 0.26) or for OS (p = 0.55).
2:::Skeletonized BITA grafts were used in 3228 (71.6%) of 4508 consecutive patients having multivessel coronary disease who underwent isolated coronary bypass surgery at the authors institution from January 1999 to August 2015. Among these BITA patients, diabetes mellitus and the insulin-requiring status were present in 972 (30.1%) and 237 (7.3%) cases, respectively. After the one-to-one propensity score-matching, 215 pairs of insulin-dependent/noninsulin-dependent people with diabetes were compared as the postoperative outcomes. The operative risk was calculated for each patient according to the logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (logistic EuroSCORE).'
3:::HbA1c ≥48mmol/mol had a sensitivity for T2DM of 31% and 25% respectively in individuals of Middle-East and Swedish ancestry. The positive and negative predictive value was high in both populations (70.3, 96.4 and 96.2, 97.6 respectively). Using HbA1c ≥42mmol/mol and ≥39mmol/mol as a predictor for prediabetes gave a sensitivity of 17% and 36% in individuals of Middle-East and 15% and 34% in individuals of Swedish ancestry.
2:::An experimental adhesive resin was prepared using HEMA-BisGMA, 66/33wt% (control). Inorganic BNNT fillers were first analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and then incorporated into the adhesive at different concentration (0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.15wt%). Degree of conversion (DC), ultimate strength, contact angle, surface free energy (SFE) microhardness, softening in solvent and bioactivity were assessed.
4:::QC exhibited significant antitumor activity against EC in vitro and was successful as maintenance therapy in chemo-resistant EC mouse xenografts. This preclinical data suggest that QC may be an important adjunct to standard chemotherapy for patients with chemo-resistant EC.
3:::Cord plasma insulin levels averaged 33.1pmol/L (25-75th percentile: 20.1-53.5), while PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy averaged (SD) 13.7μg/m(3) (2.4). Independent of maternal age, newborns sex, birth weight, gestational age, parity, early-pregnancy BMI, ethnicity, smoking status, time of the day, maternal education, time of delivery, and season of delivery, cord plasma insulin levels increased with 15.8% (95% CI 7.8 to 24.4, p<0.0001) for each SD increment in PM2.5 levels during the entire pregnancy and was most pronounced in the 2nd trimester (13.1%, 95% CI 3.4 to 23.7, p=0.007) of pregnancy. The results for PM10 exposure were similar with those of PM2.5 exposure but we did not observe an association between cord blood insulin levels and NO2 exposure.'
2:::Statistical learning of regularities embedded in auditory and visual stimuli was measured in musically trained and age-matched untrained children between the ages of 9-11years. In addition to collecting behavioural measures, we recorded electrophysiological measures to obtain an online measure of segmentation during the statistical learning tasks.
1:::The relationship between cerebrovascular disease and seizures is clearly illustrated by poststroke epilepsy. Seizures can also be the first manifestation of cerebrovascular disease and case-control studies have demonstrated that seizures carry an increased risk of subsequent stroke. Thus, seizures could serve as a marker for vascular risk that merits intervention, but more data is needed before proper trials can be conducted. The occurrence of pre-stroke seizures has not been assessed on a national scale. We asked what proportion of strokes in middle-aged and elderly patients was preceded by seizures.
3:::A higher allelic load of waist-to-hip ratio SNPs was associated with lower insulin sensitivity, higher postchallenge glucose levels, and more visceral and less subcutaneous fat mass.
2:::An online survey was undertaken of 100 neurologists in Belgium, asking for their opinion on all of the recommendations in the Consensus document.
4:::Procedural and political improvements are required in terms of the safety climate in institutions, where the study was conducted, and authentic leadership increases positive perceptions of safety climate.
3:::A consolidated database comprising 788 patients who underwent hepatectomy for CRLM in eight centres was obtained. In multivariable analyses, severe SD was associated with increased major morbidity (Dindo-Clavien grade III-V; OR 1·73, 95 per cent c.i. 1·02 to 2·95; P = 0·043). Severe steatosis was associated with decreased liver surgery-specific complications (OR 0·52, 95 per cent c.i. 0·27 to 1·00; P = 0·049), whereas steatohepatitis was linked to an increase in these complications (OR 2·08, 1·18 to 3·66; P = 0·012). Subgroup analysis showed that lobular inflammation was the sole component associated with increased overall morbidity (OR 2·22, 1·48 to 3·34; P = 0·001) and liver surgery-specific complications (OR 3·35, 2·11 to 5·32; P < 0·001). Finally, oxaliplatin treatment was linked to severe SD (OR 2·74, 1·67 to 4·49; P < 0·001).
2:::We mailed a questionnaire to 767 hospitals and clinics, comprising 628 accredited training institutions of the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (JSOG), Japan Society of Gynecologic Oncology (JSGO), or Japan Society of Gynecologic and Obstetric Endoscopy and Minimally Invasive Therapy (JSGOE) and 139 private institutions with at least one JSGOE-certified licensed gynecologic laparoscopist.
3:::To our knowledge, this is the first film report performing SLN mapping with ICG in vaginal cancer. The mapping was successful and we were able to recognize SLN of vaginal cancer. SLNs were located in the bilateral obturator fossa. According to the pathologic diagnosis, the mass size was 15 mm and invasion depth was 1 mm. Subvaginal tissue involvement and pelvic wall extension were absent. Resection margin of the vagina was free from carcinoma. No lymph node metastasis was reported including the bilateral SLNs.
3:::Naftopidil treatment decreased mean systolic BP by 18.7 mm Hg for the HT 50 mg group (p<0.001) and by 18.3 mm Hg for the HT 75 mg group (p<0.001) and mean diastolic BP by 17.5 mm Hg for the HT 50 mg group (p<0.001) and by 14.7 mm Hg for the HT 75 mg group (p=0.022). In the NT groups (both naftopidil 50 mg and 75 mg), naftopidil elicited no significant changes in BP from baseline values. After 12 weeks, naftopidil 50 and 75 mg groups showed significant improvements in IPSS scores (total, obstructive/irritative subscores, QoL score) and Qmax from baseline. AEs were reported in 7.8% (50 mg group) and 2.9% (75 mg group) of patients. In both the 50 mg and 75 mg groups, >86% of all patients agreed to continue their current medications.
1:::Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a serum glycoprotein produced predominantly in hepatocytes. As such, the synthesis of SHBG could be associated with liver function and metabolic syndrome. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels could reflect hepatocellular injury and insulin resistance; however, the relationship between hepatic steatosis and ALT with SHBG has not been investigated in humans. The objective of this study was to investigate the associations between SHBG and hepatocyte damage among Korean male patients with hepatic steatosis enrolled in a health examination program.
2:::A systematic review of the literature published between 2011 and 2016 was made, searching for all clinical studies reporting the incidence of recurrent PM after curative surgery for colorectal cancer and factors associated with the primary tumour that were likely to influence this recurrence rate.
3:::Seven new clinical studies were considered informative for risk factors and added to the 16 reviewed in 2013. Even if the level of evidence was low, data suggested rates of recurrent PM at 1 year between 54% and 71% after completely resected synchronous PM, between 62% and 71% after resection of isolated synchronous ovarian metastases, of 27% after surgery for a perforated primary tumour, of 16% after surgery for a pT4 tumour, and between 11% and 36% after surgery for a mucinous histological subtype. No new risk factor was identified.
4:::This study demonstrated that the decreased femoral head-neck offset observed in patients with ONFH was a consequence of collapse.
3:::Of the 290 retrieved citations, 6 retrospective cohort studies in women with EC (n=4723) met the inclusion criteria, and 8.9% to 23.8% were treated with metformin; OM data was available from 5 studies. In 4 studies of EC patients (n=4132), metformin use was associated with a significant reduction in OM in comparison with not using metformin (adjusted HR [aHR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.89, p=0.009). In three studies evaluating patients with EC and T2DM (n=2637), metformin use was associated with a significant reduction in OM (aHR 0.50, 95%CI 0.34-0.74, p=0.0006). There was low to moderate heterogeneity of adjusted effects across studies. There was no information about the effect of metformin on cancer-specific mortality, disease progression, or metastases.
2:::Systematic review and consensus of expert opinion.
4:::Trauma patients with HAP have higher mortality after hospital discharge. Prevention strategies for HAP including pulmonary toilet, early mobility, pain control, and early extubation must be a priority. Unfortunately, patients who develop pneumonia may have a decreased reserve, or ability to recover from their traumatic injuries and HAI. Further characterization of HAP and its subsequent treatment strategies are needed.
3:::Compared to healthy participants, SAD patients were significantly less accurate at recognising facial and prosodic emotions, and spent more time on emotion recognition. The differences were mainly driven by the lower accuracy and longer reaction times for recognising fearful emotions in SAD patients. Within the SAD patients, lower accuracy of sad face recognition was associated with higher severity of depressive and social anxiety symptoms, particularly with avoidance symptoms.
2:::Reports from a consecutive series of head magnetic resonance images with intravenous contrast performed over a 2-year period at our institution were reviewed. Studies reporting the presence of a DVA were retrieved and reviewed by a neuroradiologist. Patients were divided into 4 age groups: (1) <1 year old (neonates/infants), (2) 1 to 5 years old (toddlers and preschoolers), (3) 6 to 17 years old (grade schoolers), and (4) ≥18 years old (adults), and DVA prevalence by age group was studied.
3:::Of the 73 patients examined (56 men; mean age, 68 years), 9 (12%) were categorized into group 1. The latency from TIA onset to initial DWI was 1.7±0.6 hours for group 1 (range, 1-2.8 hours) and 3.3±2.6 hours for group 2 (range, 35 minutes to 12 hours). The probability of false-negative findings on initial DWI decreased in a time-dependent manner (25%, 21%, and 7% for 1, 2, and 3 hours, respectively), and no false-negative findings were observed on initial DWI performed at >3 hours from symptom onset. Short latency (≤2 hours) from TIA onset to initial DWI was an independent risk factor related to false-negative findings (odds ratio, 13.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-161.38; P=0.045).
4:::There is increased PBC prevalence in Thessaly with remarkable geographic clustering and seasonal variability. PBC is diagnosed at early stages although males had a more advanced disease. GLOBE score applies perfectly in Greek patients and this will likely help detecting patients that may benefit from new therapies.
2:::Home-based computer-assisted interviews were carried out with 3113 screening-eligible women in Britain. Survey items assessed self-reported screening uptake and intention to attend in future. Responses to these items were used to classify women into one of five different types of non-participants.
3:::A total of 3733 OAT initiating patients were identified. Patients treated via telemedicine were more likely to be retained in therapy than patients treated in-person (n=1590; aOR=1.27; 95% CI 1.14-1.41; p<0.001). Telemedicine patients demonstrated a retention rate of 50% at one year whereas in-person patients were retained at a rate of 39%. The mixed group also had higher likelihood of retention than the in-person group (n=418; aOR=1.26; 95% CI 1.08-1.47; p=0.001) and had a retention rate of 47% at one year.
3:::Twenty one papers were identified which were relevant to our search. In total, 653 implants were inserted and 115 (17.6%) showed evidence of trauma. The cochleas with trauma had basilar membrane elevation in 5.2%, ruptured in 5.2%, the electrode passed from the ST to the SV in 84.4% and there was grade 4 trauma in 5.2%. The studies used a variety of histological and radiological methods to assess for evidence of trauma in both cadaveric temporal bones and live recipients.
2:::A prospective, multicentre cohort study conducted in five metropolitan intensive care units (ICU). Participants were adults who had been admitted to the ICU, received more than 24 h of mechanical ventilation and survived to hospital discharge. The primary outcome was measurement of disability using the World Health Organisations Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. The secondary outcomes included the limitation of activities and changes to health-related quality of life comparing survivors with and without disability at 6 months after ICU.'
4:::The trial will determine whether the simple intervention of adding a volatile anesthetic, an intervention that can be implemented by all anesthesiologists, can improve one-year survival in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
3:::The mean basal amplitude of contractions was higher in the follicular compared to the luteal phase in uterine horn samples, but not in muscles collected from the uterine body. The amplitude of contractions increased after d-cloprostenol administration in all tissues with a greater increase in samples from cattle in the follicular phase. The frequency of contractions increased after d-cloprostenol administration in longitudinal but not in circular fibrees.
2:::This first-in-human, prospective, multi-center, non-randomized study included 39 patients (62% male, mean age 63 years, and mean baseline office blood pressure 174/93 mmHg) with drug-resistant hypertension. The primary safety and performance objectives were to characterize, from baseline to 6 months post procedure, the rate of serious procedural and device related adverse events, as adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee, and the reduction of office systolic blood pressure.
3:::As compared with non-users, current and former khat users had higher levels of depressive symptoms and distress. Khat users minimized potential health risks associated with khat use. Social and motivational factors related to khat use were different between current and former khat users.
4:::Together, the present study reports a novel use of IF in mitigating human colorectal cancer proliferation and inducing apoptosis via blockage of Akt pathway.
3:::There were 1467 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.3 [5.2] years) in the pravastatin group (48.0% [n = 704] female) and 1400 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.2 [5.2] years) in the UC group (50.8% [n = 711] female). The baseline mean (SD) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were 147.7 (19.8) mg/dL in the pravastatin group and 147.6 (19.4) mg/dL in the UC group; by year 6, the mean (SD) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were 109.1 (35.4) mg/dL in the pravastatin group and 128.8 (27.5) mg/dL in the UC group. At year 6, of the participants assigned to pravastatin, 42 of 253 (16.6%) were not taking any statin; 71.0% in the UC group were not taking any statin. The hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in the pravastatin group vs the UC group were 1.18 (95% CI, 0.97-1.42; P = .09) for all adults 65 years and older, 1.08 (95% CI, 0.85-1.37; P = .55) for adults aged 65 to 74 years, and 1.34 (95% CI, 0.98-1.84; P = .07) for adults 75 years and older. Coronary heart disease event rates were not significantly different among the groups. In multivariable regression, the results remained nonsignificant, and there was no significant interaction between treatment group and age.
2:::Natural language processing (NLP) experts collaborated with clinical experts on a patient safety committee to assist in the identification and analysis of medication related patient safety events. Different NLP algorithmic approaches were developed to identify four types of medication related patient safety events and the models were compared.
3:::There was no statistically significant difference between groups, in terms of latency. However, the mean amplitude of group I was found to be higher than other groups. The difference between group I and II was statistically significant. Myelinated axonal counts in group I was significantly higher than groups II and III.
4:::Patient age, gender, size and histological type of the tumor are criteria influencing parameters reflecting the level of difficulty. This criteria could be considered as predictors of the difficulty of LTA. Surgery in case of patients with combination of this risk factors should be handled by surgeon with sufficient experience to minimalize the risk of adverse events.
1:::We assessed the impact of staff, clinic, and community interventions on male and female family planning client visit volume and sexually transmitted infection testing at a multisite community-based health care agency.
3:::Of 7,826 male client visits during the time before intervention, most were for clients who were aged <30 years (50%), Hispanic (64%), and uninsured (81%). From preintervention to postintervention, intervention clinics significantly increased the number of male visits (4,004 to 8,385; Δ = +109%); for comparison clinics, male visits increased modestly (3,822 to 4,500; Δ = +18%). The proportion of male clinic visits where chlamydia testing was performed increased in intervention clinics (35% to 42%; p < .001) but decreased in comparison clinics (37% to 33%; p < .001). Subgroup analyses conducted among adolescent and young adult males yielded similar findings for male client volume and chlamydia testing. The number of female visits declined nearly 40% in both comparison (21,800 to 13,202; -39%) and intervention clinics (30,830 to 19,971; -35%) between preintervention and postintervention periods.
2:::First, we tested the effect of simvastatin on AD in clinical research. The fasting venous blood was collected in order to evaluate the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukine-1 beta (IL-1β), antichymotrypsin (ACT) and human tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), which were measured with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Amyloid-β (Aβ), amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1(BACE1) were tested by western blotting. Second, we used an APPswe/PS1E9 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mice to evaluate the amelioration ability of simvastatin against the memory impairment in vivo. Spatial learning and memory of mice were investigated by the Morris water maze test (MWM). The mRNA of inflammatory cytokines were measured using real-time PCR. Third, the phospho-proteome profile of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells treated with simvastatin was used to investigate the possible mechanisms.
3:::Stent reconstruction was technically successful in all 120 patients, 63 of whom (53%) underwent thrombolysis. Thirty filters (24%) were retrieved, and 93 (76%) were excluded with stent placement across the indwelling filter. Six minor and 2 major complications occurred. Clinical success was achieved in 115 patients (96%) at 6 months. Six-, 12-, and 24-month primary iliocaval stent patency rates were 96.4%, 94.8%, and 87.2%, respectively. Twenty-four month primary-assisted and secondary patency rates were 90.3% and 94.2%, respectively.
2:::Cell proliferation was evaluated by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Western blots were used to analyze the proliferating cell nuclear antigen as well as the transcription factors c-fos and c-jun. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting were used to determine the activation of MAPK after LIPUS treatment. Ruthenium red (RR), a Piezo ion channel blocker, was applied to determine the functional role of Piezo proteins in LIPUS-stimulated cell proliferation and MAPK signaling.
4:::This study for the first time supports the role of Piezo ion channels in transducing the LIPUS response in dental stem cells.
3:::Reinforced self-adhesive resin cement, regardless of concentration, increased the DC for the self- and dual-curing modes at all times studied. The concentration of the TiO2-nt and the curing mode did not influence the Ws and Sl. Regarding σf, concentrations of both 0.3 and 0.9wt% for self-curing mode resulted in data similar to that of dual-curing unreinforced cement. The E increased with the addition of 0.9wt% for self-cure mode and H increased with 0.6 and 0.9wt% for both curing modes. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that reinforced cements were biocompatible.
2:::We performed a retrospective review of the clinical, radiological, and pathological parameters of women who received annual concurrent surveillance breast MRI and mammography between 04/2013 and 12/2015 and fulfilled all of the following criteria: 1) age <70; 2) prior diagnosis of AH, LCIS or BC; 3) heterogeneously or extremely dense breast(s); and 4) did not qualify for our provincial breast MRI high risk screening program.
3:::Data concerning treatment of NDM are limited. CSII resolves some of the issues associated with insulin therapy in neonates. No clinical trials of CSII in NDM have been reported. Case reports suggest that CSII is a safe and effective means of treating NDM. CSII was initiated to improve glycaemic control, for practicality and convenience, and to overcome difficulties associated with the maintenance of long-term intravenous catheters. CSII can provide better glycaemic control than multiple daily injections, with few hypoglycaemic events. Continuous glucose monitoring integrated with the pump helps provide more precise control of blood glucose levels. CSII generally uses short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogues, and those that are approved for use in neonates appear to be appropriate for the treatment of NDM using an insulin pump.
4:::those who drink low levels of alcohol during pregnancy may have better quality diets compared to women who report no alcohol consumption. The reasons for this are complex and influenced by social context and previous pregnancy experience, which should be considered when healthcare professionals provide advice during this period.
2:::Between 2005 and 2009, a total of 51 children with CDH were treated at Astrid Lindgren Childrens Hospital. The survival rate at discharge was 86% and long-term survival rate 80%. One parent each of the long-term survivors (41 children) was included in the present study, and 34 parents (83%) agreed to participate. Participants received the Swedish Parenthood Stress Questionnaire (SPSQ). The questionnaire was supplemented by data from case records.'
3:::Clinical and molecular data were collected and analysed for 47 patients with PTEN mutation from 38 eligible families. Macrocephaly (average head circumference of + 5.7  SD) with developmental delay, ID and/or ASD were the most common presenting signs/symptoms (66 %). Clinical features included dermatological findings (66 %), gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (34 %), ASD diagnosis (50 %), abnormal brain imaging (53 % of those examined) and abnormal thyroid imaging (26 %).
2:::This was a retrospective cohort study. Data from the Swedish National Registry for Vascular Surgery (Swedvasc) and medical charts were extracted for patients treated for rAAA in the West of Sweden in the period 2008-14. Initially misdiagnosed patients were compared with correctly diagnosed patients.
4:::Release from Canadian MLDA law restrictions was strongly associated with increases in sexual-assault perpetration by young men. These findings lend support to the potential effectiveness of population-level alcohol control policies for sexual-assault prevention among youth.
3:::Some 49.1% of the patient population (55/112) and 37.5% (42/112) pOCs were CD133+ and ALDH1+ respectively. CD133+ and ALDH1+ samples were detected in 33.9% (38/112) and 36.6% (41/112) rOCs. CD133/ALDH1 coexpression was observed in 23.2% (26/112) and 15.2% (17/112) of pOCs and rOCs respectively. Pairwise analysis showed a significant shift of CD133 staining from higher (pOCs) to lower expression levels (rOCs) (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, all CD133 + pOC patients were International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO)-stage III/IV (p < 0.0001) and had significantly worse progression-free interval (PFI) (p = 0.04) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis, CD133/ALDH1 coexpression in pOCs was identified as independent prognostic factor for PFI (HR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.03-2.60; p = 0.036) and OS (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.01-2.88; p = 0.045). Analysis on 52 pts patients with known somatic BRCA status revealed that BRCA mutations did not influence CSC biomarker expression.
2:::Alcohol-dependent individuals (n = 347) were recruited from three treatment units specialized in alcohol use disorders. Participants were interviewed about their current and past alcohol and tobacco use at treatment entry and at a follow-up interview 2.5 years thereafter.
3:::After adjusting for several potential confounders, seven measures of physical activity (as a categorical and/or continuous variable) were significantly associated with CLP, CP, or both. Positive associations were seen for keeping balance, kneeling, standing, and walking/running (odds ratio 95% confidence interval range 1.0-1.9 for fourth versus first quartile). A significant positive trend was also seen for bending/twisting. Negative associations were seen for repetitive motion and sitting.
4:::Maternal occupational physical activity may be related to the etiology of orofacial clefts.
3:::Food wasted at the retail and consumer levels of the US food supply in 2012 contained 1,217 kcal, 33 g protein, 5.9 g dietary fiber, 1.7 μg vitamin D, 286 mg calcium, and 880 mg potassium per capita per day. Using dietary fiber as an example, 5.9 g dietary fiber is 23% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance for women. This is equivalent to the fiber Recommended Dietary Allowance for 74 million adult women. Adult women in 2012 underconsumed dietary fiber by 8.9 g/day, and the amount of wasted fiber is equivalent to this gap for 206.6 million adult women.
4:::These results reveal the potential of Tetra-Pt(bpy) as a novel oncotherapeutic agent for targeting ALT cancer cells.
2:::We identified patients diagnosed with stage I-II (cT1-2N0M0) glottic cancer from 2004 to 2013 within the National Cancer Data Base who were treated with either HFX (2.25 Gy/fraction to 63-65.25 Gy) or CFX (2.0 Gy/fraction to 66-70 Gy). The overall survival of patients receiving HFX vs CFX was compared using the log-rank test, multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, and propensity score matching. All statistical tests were two-sided.
3:::ILAE class Ia outcome was achieved in 18 children. Among the MI(5 phases) in the resection areas, MI(3-4 Hz) was the highest. The OR(HFO) and MI(3-4 Hz) in both total area and resection areas were significantly higher in the good seizure outcome group than in the poor outcome group. The OR(HFO) and MI(3-4 Hz) in resection areas were significantly higher than in the MA.
4:::In the absence of evidence-based guidelines to ensure adequate transitions from hospital to home for children with medical complexity, identification of potential models to support this transition is imperative. We identified interventions, frameworks, models and programs in the literature that might inform the development of such guidelines; however, there is a need for consensus around the definition for children with medical complexity and the limited number of these studies and lack of high quality of evidence signals the need for further research to improve the transition from hospital to home and ultimately, improve patient and family outcomes.
2:::A literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Korean scientific database, Chinese medical databases, and the Indian medical database to identify eligible studies for determining the association of ADRB3 rs4994 and T2DM risk. The association was examined in five genetic models: the allelic(AG), recessive(RG), dominant(DG), homozygous(HMG), and heterozygous(HTG) genetic models. Subgroup analyses stratified by ethnicity(Asians and others) were assessed.
3:::Type 2 diabetes was associated with increased odds for cold-related dyspnoea [Adjusted OR 1.72 (95% CI, 1.28-2.30)], chest pain [2.10 (1.32-3.34)] and respiratory symptoms [1.85 (1.44-2.38)] compared with normal glucose metabolism. Screened type 2 diabetes showed increased OR for cold-related dyspnoea [1.36 (1.04-1.77)], cough [1.41 (1.06-1.87)] and cardiac symptoms [1.51 (1.04-2.20)]. Worsening of glycaemic status was associated with increased odds for cold-related dyspnoea (from 1.16 in impaired fasting glucose to 1.72 in type 2 diabetes, P=0.000), cough (1.02-1.27, P=0.032), chest pain (1.28-2.10, P=0.006), arrhythmias (0.87-1.74, P=0.020), cardiac (1.11-1.99, P=0.000), respiratory (1.14-1.84, P=0.000) and all symptoms (1.05-1.66, P=0.003).
4:::This database can help advance firearm policy research by providing 26 years of comprehensive policy data that will allow longitudinal panel study designs that minimize the limitations present in many previous studies.
2:::We used 2009 to 2013 Global School-based Student Health Survey data to assess 137 449 young adolescents aged 12 to 15 years with available data (via a standardized questionnaire) on frequency of carbonated soft drink consumption.
3:::Overall, young adolescents reported having consumed carbonated soft drinks 1.39 times per day (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26, 1.51), and 54.3% of adolescents reported consuming a carbonated soft drink at least once per day. Frequency (times per day) varied greatly across countries, ranging from 0.52 (95% CI = 0.43, 0.60) in Kiribati to 2.39 (95% CI = 2.25, 2.53) in Suriname.
1:::Non-functioning pituitary adenomas are common, and the treatment and follow-up of these patients represent a multidisciplinary challenge. First line treatment is transphenoidal surgery, with debulking or total removal of tumour. A substantial portion of the tumours relapse after surgery, and there is no consensus of how to follow these patients postoperatively. Our aim was to characterize the postoperative growth of non-functioning pituitary adenomas and correlate it to clinical and paraclinical data.
3:::During training, heart rates and perceived exertion did not differ between groups (~68% upper-body peak heart rate, ~12 Borg units, both P > 0.05), whereas power during ECCarm was ~2× that for CONarm (122 ± 43 vs. 59 ± 20 W, P < 0.01). Muscle soreness for ECCarm was greater than CONarm (P = 0.02), however, soreness was minimal for both groups (<0.50 cm). Following training, ECCarm exhibited greater changes in elbow extensor strength (16 ± 10 vs. 1 ± 9%, P = 0.01) and upper-body power (6 ± 8 vs. -3 ± 7%, P < 0.01) compared to CONarm. Peripheral and central arterial stiffness did not change for either group (both P > 0.05).
2:::Analyses were performed in 2 independent diagnostic cohorts [European Advantageous Predictors of Acute Coronary Syndrome Evaluation (APACE) study, Australian-New Zealand 2-h Accelerated Diagnostic Protocol to Assess patients with chest Pain symptoms using contemporary Troponins as the only biomarker (ADAPT) study] employing hs-cTnT (Elecsys) and hs-cTnI (Architect). The final diagnosis was adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists.
4:::Our results indicate that LOLA is a simple method that is useful for DNA-based detection of translocations in challenging situations, particularly where the breakpoints are not tightly clustered. The assay also has the added benefit of permitting rapid mapping of the breakpoints.
3:::Of 65 children studied, acceptable jugular bulb samples (SjbO2 absolute difference between samples ≤10%) were obtained in 57 (88%). The ΔSaO2-SjbO2, ΔSaO2-ScO2, and ΔSaO2-REF CX were positively correlated with SaO2 and negatively correlated with Hb (all P < .001). Although by diagnostic group ScO2 differed statistically (P = .002), values in the cyanotic patients were within the range considered normal (69% ± 6%). COE estimated by the difference between arterial and jugular bulb O2 content (ΔCaO2-CjbO2, mL O2/100 mL) was not different for cyanotic and acyanotic patients (P = .10), but estimates using ΔSaO2-SjbO2, ΔSaO2-ScO2, or ΔSaO2-ScO2/SaO2 were significantly different between the cyanotic and acyanotic children (P < .001).
2:::Professional librarians searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles in any language describing studies of dilation in EoE through December 2016. Studies were selected and data were abstracted independently and in duplicate. Random effects modelling was used to generate summary estimates for clinical improvement and complications (haemorrhage, perforation, hospitalisation, and death).
4:::A novel Level A IVIVC was successfully developed and validated for the new potassium chloride ER formulations using urinary pharmacokinetic data. This successful IVIVC may facilitate future development or manufacturing changes to the potassium chloride ER formulation.
3:::Seventy-six surgeons responded (41%). The majority (67%) adhered to medical guidelines for microprolactinoma, but 26% recommended surgery. However, for a macroprolactinoma at diagnosis, the number of surgeons who recommended DA treatment vs. surgical treatment were almost evenly split (χ(2)p=0.06). The practice setting of a multidisciplinary clinic with endocrinologists did not significantly influence our respondents choice. For a patient who presented after becoming pregnant on DA, our respondents were against surgery to prevent tumor growth (96%).'
2:::Cultured rat cerebral cortical neurons were treated with insulin, insulin glargine U100 (Gla), insulin detemir (Det), or insulin degludec (Deg). Moreover, these drugs were intracerebroventricularly administered to mice. Their efficacies were evaluated by biochemical and behavioral analyses.
3:::45 patients with IAOCD, 23 healthy controls and 14 non-affected 1st degree relatives were recruited. Visuo-tactile temporal discrimination separated best between controls and patients as well as between controls and 1st degree relatives. 36% of the latter had an abnormal visuo-tactile temporal discrimination. No difference between patients and healthy controls was found for the other paradigms.
4:::This study provides preliminary evidence that TBS produces direct changes in cortical reactivity in the prefrontal cortex. Combining TBS with TMS-EEG may be a useful approach to optimise stimulation paradigms prior to the conduct of clinical trials.
2:::Irinotecan and bevacizumab were administered as a continuous intravenous infusion on Day 1 at 150 mg/mm(2) and 5 mg/kg, respectively. Capecitabine was orally administered in two divided doses on Days 2-8. Each 2-week treatment cycle was defined as a single course of treatment. During Phase I, we determined the recommended dose for capecitabine. In Phase II trials, efficacy and treatment safety was verified (UMIN000003934).
3:::Birth weight above 4 kg was more prevalent in the non-diabetic women compared to the diet-treated GDM women (27 vs. 18%, p = 0.012) but similar to the GDM women who had no MNT (24%). Lower birth weight was associated with longer duration of MNT (r = -0.13, p = 0.021). The birth weight was 1.2 g lower per day of treatment.
1:::Metabolic syndrome may predispose to cardiovascular diseases. Since, in recent studies, vitamin D is advocated for cardioprotective roles, this study was designed to investigate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on proatherogenic inflammatory markers and common carotid intima media thickness in subjects with metabolic syndrome.
4:::Vitamin D supplementation improved some proatherogenic inflammatory markers in subjects with metabolic syndrome. No changes of high sensitivity C-reactive protein and carotid intima media thickness were shown after 16 weeks.
3:::A systematic review that summarizes the important subjects in the diagnosis and prevention of endometrial cancer.
2:::In this retrospective cohort study, 14,093 Japanese (7557 men and 6736 women), who received the health-checkup program from 2004 to 2012, were enrolled. Overweight and obesity were defined as body mass index 23.0-25.0 and ≥25.0 kg/m(2). Four metabolic factors (impaired fasting glucose, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia and low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration) were used for definition of metabolically healthy (less than two factors) or metabolically abnormal (two or more). We divided the participants into three groups: metabolically healthy non-overweight (9755 individuals, men/women = 4290/5465), metabolically healthy overweight (2547 individuals, 1800/747) and metabolically healthy obesity (1791 individuals, 1267/524). Fatty liver was diagnosed by ultrasonography.
3:::Fifty-one percent of patients had ZJ fusion in at least 1 vertebral level. Fusion was present in 129 of 652 individual ZJ. Syndesmophytes and bridging were often present in vertebral levels without ZJ fusion, suggesting that syndesmophytes most often develop first. ZJ fusion was present in 34% of vertebral levels with syndesmophytes and 55.9% of levels with bridging, suggesting a closer association with bridging. Syndesmophytes and ZJ fusion had similar associations with the modified Schober test, but syndesmophytes were more strongly associated with limitations in lateral thoracolumbar flexion. ZJ rarely showed new fusion over 4 years.
2:::One hundred and ten specimens were bonded using two self-etch application modes and examined with or without thermomechanical cycling (10,000 thermal cycles and 240,000 mechanical cycles) to simulate one year of intraoral functioning. The bonded specimens were sectioned for microtensile bond testing, ultrastructural and nanoleakage examination using transmission electron microscopy. Changes in the composition of mineralised dentine after adhesive application were examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
3:::One-year adjusted composite rates decreased from 9.3% in 2003 to 7.4% in 2012 (trend test P = .02). Significant decreases in 3-year (P < .001) and 5-year (P = .002) composite rates were also observed. Rates of recurrent stroke decreased at 1 and 3 years (P < .01), but not 5 years (P = .21), whereas death rates declined across follow-up times. Conversely, rates of institutionalization increased at 3 and 5 years (P < .01).
4:::A small number of heterogenous studies have evaluated the relationship between system factors and quality or safety in arterial surgery. There is some evidence of an association between system factors and patient outcomes, but there is more work to be done to fully understand this relationship. Future research would benefit from consistency in definitions, the use of validated assessment tools, measurement of clinically relevant endpoints, and adherence to national reporting guidelines.
2:::Resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings were obtained from 41 women with PTSD and comorbid depressive symptoms, and 16 healthy women. Oscillatory brain activity was extracted for five frequency bands and 11 source locations, and analyzed in relation to shutdown dissociation and adversity-related measures.
3:::In total, 713 women were included, 603 without and 110 with a previous cesarean section. In women with a previous cesarean Section 83 (75%) niches were observed using hysteroscopy. Anterior wall disruptions were not observed in women without a cesarean section. The following niche features were identified and incorporated in a registration form: polyps, cysts, myometrium defect, fibrotic tissue, (abnormal) vascular pattern, lateral branches, mucus production inside the defect, and bleeding.
3:::SA237 plasma concentrations were almost equivalent between dams and their infants and dropped throughout the postnatal period, pharmacologically relevant exposure was maintained for 147 days after birth at 50 mg/kg. Because the binding of SA237 to IL-6R inhibited IL-6R-mediated clearance of IL-6, serum IL-6 increased in dams and infants. However, there were no SA237-related adverse effects on dams, embryos, fetuses, or infants. SA237 pharmacological effects contributed to the suppression of plasma cell differentiation and antibody production by inhibiting IL-6 signaling, and T cell-dependent antibody reaction was minimally suppressed in infants, but physiological immunoglobulin class switching and general antibody production against a T cell-dependent antigen were maintained.
4:::Our results suggest that routine shunting should be considered in case of acute WS since it may play a protective role. Further studies are eagerly awaited to better define the timing and the best treatment option for both acute WS and TS related to an SCS in order to reduce postoperative neurologic morbidity.
2:::Between February 2014 and February 2016, a total of 46 patients with lower extremity DVT were treated with PMT by using Cleaner rotational thrombectomy system. Preprocedural, intraprocedural, postprocedural, and follow-up records of patients were collected and retrospectively analyzed.
3:::The mandibular posterior teeth were significantly uprighted in both groups with both treatment protocols.
2:::A total of 28 healthy males volunteered to take part in the study. Sleep quality, sleep duration and physical activity were subjectively assessed by questionnaires. Sleep pattern was classified by sleep duration (>7h or <7h of sleep per night) and sleep quality according to the sum of measured points and/or scores by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Incremental exercise test was performed at 35 watts for untrained subjects, 70 watts for physically active subjects and 105 watts for well-trained subjects.
3:::HRmax was correlated with sleep quality (r=0.411, p=0.030) and sleep duration (r=-0.430, p=0.022). Participants reporting good sleep quality presented higher values of Wmax, VO2max and lower values of HRmax when compared to participants with altered sleep. Regarding sleep duration, only Wmax was influenced by the amount of sleeping hours per night and this association remained significant even after adjustment by VO2max.
4:::Endovascular VAA repairs are increasing. Despite patients having worse comorbidities and more nonelective admissions, endovascular therapy appears to be associated with decreased mortality and complications and shorter hospital stays.'
3:::253 patients from 49 centres were included. Median age was 66 years. Main primary locations were pancreas (21%), colorectal (27%), oesophagus-stomach (18%); primary location was unknown in 20%. Tumours were metastatic at diagnosis in 78% of cases. Performance status (PS) at diagnosis was 0-1 in 79% of patients. Among the 147 (58%) cases reviewed by an expert pathological network, 39% were classified as small cell NEC and 61% as large cell NEC. Median Ki67 index was 75% (range, 20-100). Median overall survival was 15.6 (13.6-17.0) months. Significant adverse prognostic factors in univariate analysis were PS > 1 (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.5), metastatic disease (HR = 1.6), NSE>2 upper limit of normal [ULN]; HR = 3.2), CgA>2 ULN (HR = 1.7) and lactate dehydrogenase >2 ULN (HR = 2.1). After first-line palliative chemotherapy (CT1) with platinum-etoposide (n = 152), objective response, progression-free survival and overall survival were 50%, 6.2 and 11.6 months; they were 24%, 2.9 and 5.9, respectively, after post-CT1 FOLFIRI regimen (n = 72).
1:::Compare imaging features of indolent and non-indolent mastocytosis.
2:::During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 30 individuals with GAD and 30 healthy controls (HC) completed a well-validated explicit emotion regulation task designed to measure emotional reactivity and regulation of reactivity. During the task, participants viewed negative images (Look-Negative' condition) and, on some trials, used a cognitive strategy to reduce negative affective response ('Reappraise' condition).'
4:::After multimodality treatments initiated with IVC, 50% of salvaged Group D retinoblastoma eyes had <20/200 vision, with TTT being a risk factor for worse vision; 60% had strabismus; and 22% had nystagmus.
3:::The cohort included 539 patients, median age 13 years (range, 3-18) and 51.0% female. With retrospective application of the AUC, echocardiogram indications were classified as ""appropriate"" (304/539, 56.4%), ""maybe appropriate"" (68/539, 12.6%), and ""rarely appropriate"" (167/539, 31.0%). Echocardiograms were performed in 70.5% (380/539) of patients overall and in 35.9% (60/167) of patients with ""rarely appropriate"" indications. Of those undergoing echocardiography, abnormal findings were present in 5.0% (19/380) and incidental findings in 2.6% (10/380); however, only one echocardiogram (0.3%) led to a diagnosis considered to be contributory to the patients chest pain. There were no abnormal findings in the ""rarely appropriate"" subgroup. Provider use of echocardiography for ""rarely appropriate"" indications varied widely from 0 to 75% across 15 providers (P = .004). In multivariable analysis, provider clinical experience of ≥20 years was associated with a lower rate of echocardiograms for ""rarely appropriate"" indications (odds ratio, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.09-0.47] vs. providers with <10 years' experience, P < .001). There was no significant association between race, ethnicity, age, sex, payer status, or total number of patients seen and performance of an echocardiogram meeting the ""rarely appropriate"" indications. Echocardiograms with ""rarely appropriate"" indications resulted in $47,578 in excess costs over the 1-year study.'
2:::Isobaric Tags For Relative And Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics was used to quantitatively detect and map proteins in SW1353 chondrocyte-like cells pre-treated with ASG-IV or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) or ASG-IV+IL-1β. The iTRAQ-labeled peptides were fractionated by high-accuracy liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Cell apoptosis and differentially expressed proteins was detected by flow cytometry (FCM), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and western blotting, respectively.
3:::The mobile app was a feasible and acceptable method to measure exposure to tobacco messages. The majority of messages (45.0%) were seen on the Internet, and many were user-generated. Thirty-day recall of messages at baseline was poorly correlated with messages reported via Event EMA during the study period; however, the correlation between post-study 30-day recall and Event EMA was much stronger (r=0.603 for industry-sponsored messages, r=0.599 for user-generated messages). Correlations between Daily EMAs and 30-day recall of message exposure (baseline and post-study) were small (baseline: r=0.329-0.389) to large (post-study: r=0.656-0.766).
4:::the prevalence of ED (7.6%) and its association with anxiety and depression symptoms during pregnancy highlights the need for specialist care for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Given the importance of proper nutrition during pregnancy, both with regard to maternal health and fetal development, it is necessary to have specific predetermined evaluation protocols implemented by health care professionals for the diagnosis of ED during pregnancy.
2:::Eight multiple myeloma cell lines were exposed to either one of the two exposure regimens. We quantified the intracellular unbound carfilzomib fraction up to 48 h with a new ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) method. Intracellular concentrations were compared to simultaneously determined cell viability (AlamarBlue(®) assay) and proteasomal subunit activity (ProGlo™ assay).
3:::C4BP significantly inhibited IAPP-mediated IL-1β secretion from primed macrophages at physiological concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. C4BP bound to and was internalised together with IAPP. C4BP did not affect IAPP uptake into phagolysosomal compartments, although it did inhibit its formation into amyloid fibrils. The loss of macrophage phagolysosomal integrity induced by IAPP incubation was inhibited by co-incubation with C4BP. Supernatant fractions from macrophages activated with IAPP inhibited both insulin secretion and viability of clonal beta cells in an IL-1β-dependent manner but the presence of C4BP during macrophage IAPP incubation rescued beta cell function and viability. In human and mouse islets, the presence of amyloid deposits correlated with higher numbers of infiltrating macrophages. Isolated human islets expressed and secreted C4BP, which increased with addition of IL-1β.
2:::The main outcome measure for this post-hoc analysis was change in MADRS score from baseline to week 6 endpoint for two lurasidone-treated subgroups: presumptive pre-menopausal (<52years) and presumptive post-menopausal (≥52years) patients, compared to placebo treatment, using a mixed-model for repeated-measures analysis, and calculation of the effect size for each subgroup. Additional efficacy assessments included the CGI-S, HAM-A and YMRS. An exploratory analysis was also conducted removing presumptive peri-menopausal women (ages 45-51years) to allow for clearer definition of pre- and post-menopausal status.
3:::A total of 1412 patients from 8 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results of univariate analysis (HR=1.73, 95% CI: 1.19-2.52, P=0.004) and multivariate analysis (HR=2.49, 95% CI: 1.89-3.28, P<0.001) demonstrated that high HE4 expression in lung cancer patients was correlated with poor overall survival (OS). We observed through further stratified analysis of the results of the univariate analysis that high HE4 expression was associated with worse OS in Asian lung cancer patients (HR=2.48, 95% CI: 1.88-3.26, P<0.001). However, there was no significant association between high HE4 expression and poor OS in Caucasian patients (HR=1.12, 95% CI: 0.80-1.55, P=0.513).
4:::Patients with AIDS have a 1.75-fold increased race- and sex-adjusted incidence of intermediate-stage AMD compared with that found in an HIV-uninfected cohort. This increased incidence is consistent with the increased incidence of other age-related diseases in antiretroviral-treated, immune-restored, HIV-infected persons when compared with HIV-uninfected persons.
2:::In this multicenter, prospective, feasibility study, consecutive ultrafiltration treatments (lasting ≥6 hours and with an ultrafiltration rate ≥100ml/h) with the CHIARA device and a single peripheral venous approach were performed at 6 Italian hospitals. For each session, we evaluated the performance of the venous access, the ultrafiltrate volume removed, and the cause of its interruption.
3:::The von Mises equivalent values found on the cortical bone were higher than that recorded on the trabecular bone. Additionally, the bone volume associated with high stress values was higher in cortical and trabecular bone for oblique loading compared to axial loading. The values of von Mises equivalent stress around Morse taper implant-abutment system were lower on both axial and oblique loads than those recorded for external hexagon implant-abutment systems.
4:::Our study indicates that variations in OXTR and Gβ3 genes are specifically associated with presence and severity of SA in childhood and adulthood, but not with depression or anxiety in general. Because there is increasing interest in oxytocin in social behavior, the gene-SA associations identified have potential translational and clinical relevance.
2:::Twenty-two individuals participated in this study, which had a cross-over, repeated measures design. Seven shoulder muscles (upper and lower trapezius, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, posterior deltoid, middle deltoid, and serratus anterior) were monitored using surface electromyography (SEMG) during shoulder abduction performed with a clinician-administered sustained mobilization, and with self-administered sustained mobilization. Muscle activity levels were measured prior, during and after the sustained glide was applied to the shoulder. Mixed-effect models for repeated measures were used for within- and between-condition comparisons.
3:::In univariate analysis, female gender and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) were associated with lower pain tolerance, indicated by reaching the ceiling time of 180s in ice water (females 19% vs males 29%, NEC 7% vs no NEC 25%). Female gender was associated with higher pain intensity (mean difference 0.58; 95%CI 0.21; 0.95) and lower pain threshold (log rank test p 0.007). In a multivariate Cox regression analyses, emotion focused avoidance pain coping style was significantly associated with lower pain threshold (hazard ratio HR 1.38; 95%CI 1.02; 1.87) and pain tolerance (HR 1.72; 95%CI 1.21; 2.42). NEC was significantly associated with lower pain threshold (HR 1.47; 95%CI 1.01; 2.14) and pain tolerance (HR 1.63; 95%CI 1.09; 2.41).
3:::Adherence in TR patients (n = 38, mean age 20.4, 13.2% nonadherent) was noninferior to and numerically better than YAs diagnosed in adulthood (n = 41, mean age 21.2, 24.4%). Nonadherence in the pediatric control group (n = 50, mean age 14.7) was 8.0%. YAs had significantly higher medication-related concerns (14.6 versus 11.9, P = 0.02) than the pediatric group. The IPAC intervention reduced nonadherence rates by 60% (P = 0.004).
4:::TR patients did not have worse adherence than YAs diagnosed in adulthood. Protective factors may include previous treatment in pediatric centers and the salient symptomatology of inflammatory bowel disease, whereas increasing concerns over medications contribute to nonadherence in YAs. Pharmacist-led counselling improves adherence in these patients.
2:::After otoscopic examination, a 3-mm perforation was made in the posterior quadrant of both tympanic membranes of 50 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Venous blood was withdrawn from the rats, then centrifuged. PRF was obtained in membrane form. The membrane was placed on the right tympanic membrane perforation. The perforations on the left side were left to spontaneously heal and, thus, formed the control group. Daily examinations were made of 20 rats and the time to healing of the tympanic membrane was recorded. The remaining 30 rats were separated into five groups of six, and histopathological examination was made. Evaluation was made in respect of the presence of oedema in the lamina propria, neovascularization, fibroblastic reaction, and inflammatory cells.
1:::Although the role of eosinophils in eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EGE) is not fully understood, they are believed to be a principal effector cell. Previous studies have demonstrated that eotaxin and its specific receptor, cysteine-cysteine chemokine receptor-3 (CCR3), play a central role in eosinophil trafficking into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Thus, we examined the targeting of CCR3 as a potential therapeutic intervention for EGE in a mouse model.
3:::Ten studies and 10 644 patients were evaluated. The crude H. pylori eradication rate determined by intention-to-treat analysis was 87.9% and 72.8% in the vonoprazan-based triple therapy and PPI-based triple therapy respectively. The eradication rate of the vonoprazan-based triple therapy was superior to that of the PPI-based triple therapy (pooled risk ratio [RR] [95% confidence interval (CI)]=1.19 [1.15-1.24]) In addition, there was no significant difference in dropout rate due to adverse event between the regimens (pooled RR of the vonoprazan-based triple therapy [95% CI]=0.69 [0.23-2.03]). The incidence of any adverse events also did not differ between the regimens (pooled RR [95% CI]=1.02 [0.78-1.34]).
2:::Eighty-eight embryos from single pronucleus (1PN) two polar bodies (2PB) ICSI zygotes from 64 preimplantational genetic screening (PGS) cycles (October 2012-December 2014), were retrospectively analyzed. Zygotes were cultured in a time-lapse incubator. Embryo biopsy was performed on day 3 and genetic analysis approached by array comparative genomic hybridization.
4:::C-peptide, a marker of beta-cell response, responds to and is influenced by glycemia and renal function in critically ill patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, in our cohort, exogenous insulin administration was associated with a greater increase in c-peptide in response to hyperglycemia. Trial Registration Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12615000216516).
1:::Osteoporosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the modern world. Our study aims to describe the trends in incidence of hip fractures in relation to drug utilization patterns and the average price of antiosteoporotic medicines in Estonia.
3:::In 2592 patients severe hypoglycemia was diagnosed and treated by emergency physicians (T1DM: n=829/32%; T2DM: n=1763/68%). The median age of patients was 64 (57-72 [20-85]) years. Compared to mild temperatures (10-20°C) the frequency of severe hypoglycemia increased significantly at temperatures above 20°C (+18% (95%-CI: [7%; 22%], p=0.007) and below 10°C (+15% (95%-CI: [6%; 24%], p<0.001).
2:::To this end, we analyzed LOX expression by immunohistochemistry in archived tumor material from advanced high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients (n=70) and correlated data with clinicopathological parameters and with response to chemotherapy. In vitro experiments were also used to investigate the functional consequences of LOX expression on behavioral aspects of HGSOC cells.
3:::About 10% of 605 patients had RDIs <85%. Predictive factors included age, episodes of febrile neutropenia and grade III or IV hypersensitivity reaction to taxanes. Other adverse events, such as peripheral neuropathy, did not affect RDI. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclofosfamide, docetaxel (FEC-D) protocol was 24% and therefore was above the threshold set by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer for primary granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis. No relationship between RDI and (disease-free) survival was found with a median follow-up of 38 months. Apart from the stage of disease, obesity is a predictor of poor outcome.
4:::Our analyses suggest that cyclothymic temperament quantity could best correspond to the temperamental profile of Substance Use Disorder patients independently of principal substance of abuse (alcohol or heroin), and that irritable temperament quantity may differentiate HUD from AUD patients. Hyperthymic temperament typology seemed to be highly protective for HUD and, though a bit less, for AUD patients, and was a typical feature of healthy controls.
3:::Weight loss was greater for TECH and STND than SELF at 6 months (-5.7 kg [95% confidence interval: -7.2 to -4.1] vs. -2.7 kg [95% confidence interval: -5.1 to -0.3], P < 0.05) but not 12 months. TECH and STND did not differ except that more STND (59%) than TECH (34%) achieved ≥ 5% weight loss at 6 months (P < 0.05). Self-monitoring adherence was greater in TECH than STND (P < 0.001), greater in both interventions than SELF (P < 0.001), and covaried with weight loss (r(84) = 0.36-0.51, P < 0.001).
2:::The study included 48 patients with benign goiter scheduled for hemithyroidectomy or total thyroidectomy; there were 16 cases of solitary thyroid nodules, 27 cases of multinodular goiter, and 5 cases of toxic goiter.
3:::Median follow-up was 6.8 years (range 4.1-12.5 years). There were 14 deaths (7 cancer specific) and 14 recurrences (5 local recurrences and 9 distant metastases). The median time to recurrence was 6.0 years (range 4.1-8.2 years). Grade ≥2 late toxicities were frequently observed in the bladder (19%) and small/large intestine (15%). Multivariate analysis revealed a higher rate of late toxicity in patients aged ≥51 years at diagnosis (small/large intestine: hazard ratio, HR, 2.5 [1.2-5.5]; bladder: HR 2.4 [1.3-4.5]; and bone: HR 4.3 [1.2-15.8]) than patients aged <51 years. Compared to the general population, LCCS exhibited a significantly higher rate of body image concerns, sexual dysfunction, lymphedema, and peripheral neuropathy.
4:::From this territory-wide Hong Kong Diabetes Database, we observed decreases in incidence of cardiovascular-renal complications and death and corresponding improvements in risk factor control over a 13-year period.
2:::Four eyes of 2 patients with extremely high (>10 D) and irregular [surface asymmetry index >1.0 D] post-penetrating keratoplasty astigmatism occurring after complete suture removal underwent MALK and were followed for at least 3 years after the procedure. In all cases, 250-µm lamellar keratectomy was performed, followed by 2 full-thickness incisions through the penetrating keratoplasty scar and the placement of an appropriately sized donor graft, which was secured with a double-running 10-0 nylon suture. All sutures were removed in all eyes within 1 year from surgery. Corrected distance visual acuity, refraction, corneal topography, and endothelial cell density were noted at each examination.
3:::From January 2010 to November 2013, 156 general practices (280 patients) were randomly assigned to usual care (control) and 159 (283 patients) to the intervention. The median age was 70.1 years; 65% were male. Overall, >80% of participants were prescribed recommended secondary prevention therapies at baseline. The primary efficacy analysis comprised 533 participants, with 30 either dying or lost to follow-up. In adjusted analyses, no significant between-group difference was found in the cardiovascular risk score at 12 months (0.04, 95% confidence interval -1.7, 1.8).
4:::The CGL can be reliably identified on MRI and MRA.
2:::Data were obtained from 4 focus groups conducted with 22 women of child-bearing age, who had a chronic physical or mental health condition or disability that influenced their pregnancy decisions. Group transcripts were analyzed using conventional content analysis to identify the types of factors that influence pregnancy decisions and themes related to pregnancy decision-making.
3:::In total, 29 (11%) of 275 included patients were ACPA-positive, substantiating the previous description of ACPA in CAD patients. Increased cumulative cardiac mortality was observed in ACPA-positive patients in comparison with ACPA-negative patients. Moreover, after correction for other associated factors, ACPA-positivity was associated with long-term mortality (HR 3.1 [CI 1.4-7.1] p-value=0.01) and long-term combined endpoint of re-infarction and death (HR 2.4 [1.2-4.6] p-value=0.01).
1:::This study aimed to compare the biomechanical and histopathologic effects of transepithelial and accelerated epithelium-off pulsed-light accelerated corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL).
3:::ONHs of 3 enucleated eyes were examined. The LC was more clearly imaged when the retina and part of the prelaminar tissue were removed (quality score, 39.01±3.30 vs. 26.40±5.85; P<0.001) and when the tissue was kept moist during imaging (quality score, 38.70±2.11 vs. 36.18±5.98; P<0.001). LC image quality was similar before and after fixation (quality score, 38.84±6.57 vs. 39.21±9.69; P=0.79). LC beams and part of retrolaminar glial columns identified in OCT scans matched those in histologic sections. LC beams and pores in 3-dimensional reconstructions matched those in disc photographs.
4:::High-resolution cross-sectional images of the LC, comparable to histologic sections, can be obtained using anterior segment EDI OCT in ex vivo eyes with proper tissue preparation.
2:::This was an observational retrospective cohort study of a group of patients with inflammatory bowel disease on infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA) who had anti-TNFa trough and antibody levels measured, during maintenance phase of treatment. Anti-TNFa trough and antibody levels were measured using standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques. Baseline patient characteristics were determined and patients were reviewed 1 year later. Clinical assessment took place with partial Mayo scores for ulcerative colitis and Harvey-Bradshaw index for Crohns disease. C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin were also measured. Poor outcomes were defined as the following: need for rescue steroids, dose intensification, surgery, or treatment discontinuation.'
3:::A single administration of PF11 significantly decreased the infarct area, reduced the brain water content, and improved neurological functions, even 4 hours after the onset of pMCAO. Meanwhile, PF11 lessened the ischemic insult-mediated loss of neurons and activation of astrocytes and microglia. Furthermore, PF11 attenuated pMCAO-induced accumulations of autophagosomes and apoptosis. We further observed a remarkable effect of PF11 in reversing the ischemic insult-induced accumulation of autophagosomes (LC3-II) and abnormal aggregation of autophagic proteins (SQSTM1 and ubiquitin). Furthermore, PF11 was capable of improving lysosomal function and lysosome/autophagosome fusion following pMCAO, and this change was reversed by the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine. Also, the improvement of ischemic outcome and the antiapoptotic effect induced by PF11 was reversed by CQ.
2:::A total of 57 isolates of Enterococci were collected from patients with UTI. Enterococcus species were identified using conventional microbiological methods. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the isolates were determined by the Kirby-Bauer disk-diffusion. The Modified Congo red agar (MCRA) and Microtiter plate methods used to assess the ability of biofilm formation. All enterococcal isolates were examined for determination of biofilm-related genes, esp, asa1 and ebpR using PCR method.
3:::Of 57 enterococcal isolates, 85.9% were recognized as E. faecalis and 14.1% of them were E. faecium. According to our results, linezolid, chloramphenicol and nitrofurantoin were the most effective agents against Enterococcus species. Overall, 26.5% of E. faecalis and 75% of E. faecium isolates were biofilm producers, respectively. Resistance to some antibiotics including penicillin G, ampicillin, vancomycin, nitrofurantoin and chloramphenicol, and ciprofloxacin was significantly higher among biofilm producers than non-biofilm producers Enterococci. The esp, asa1 and ebpR genes were present in 84.2%, 91.2% and 100% isolates. In this study, there was not a significant relationship between presence of these genes and biofilm formation.
4:::MAs that appear hyporeflective on structural SDOCT have a lower detection rate on OCTA. The results of this study may help further understand the different blood flow dynamics pattern in MAs.
1:::To report on the outcomes of a novel treatment regimen for patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who were fit for curative treatment but not fit for cisplatin.
3:::A total of 205 patients underwent surgery for LGTP. Characteristics of the peritoneum were noted on the surgical report in 141 cases (68%). Abdominal drainage was implemented in 118 patients (83%). After propensity score matching, there was no difference between drainage and no drainage groups in the major postoperative complications (34.7% vs 34.8%; P = .89).
2:::Doctors were interviewed about their views of ENT knowledge amongst non-ENT doctors, and asked to identify key topics. These topics were then used to devise a questionnaire, which was distributed to multiple stakeholders in order to identify the key topics.
4:::Women whose mothers were not in stable marriage relationships had higher odds of being overweight or obese in adulthood. The finding that even women raised in the context of stable cohabitation had higher odds of being overweight or obese is intriguing as these relationships are socially accepted in Sweden.
3:::For a notable period of time, researchers have mainly focused on the epigenetic pathways that are involved in the modulation of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes. Recent studies have proposed a central role for chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of chronic disease, including Behçets disease.'
2:::Eight patients who had been suspected of having either primary pheochromocytoma or primary paraganglioma and 1 patient with known pheochromocytoma were included in the analysis. Among the 8 patients without known diagnosis, 7 had been suggested by anatomical imaging modalities, whereas one of them presented with initial negative anatomical imaging interpretation. All of 9 patients underwent Ga-DOTATATA PET/CT, FDG PET/CT, and MIBG SPECT/CT for further evaluation. The imaging findings were compared with postsurgical pathology and follow-up.
3:::Twenty five patients were included, 23 could be followed up for 1 year. In 93.8% of the visits, patients had a Holgers score less than or equal to 1. One patient needed revision surgery due to skin overgrowth. 18.8% of the patients experienced mild pain during follow-up, primarily during the first month. Sensibility loss was very limited. Compared with similar patients having the smooth titanium abutment (loaded at 2 wk), there was a slightly increased level of short-term soft tissue reaction.'
4:::nNO is a sensitive and specific test for PCD in cooperative patients (generally >5 yr old) with high clinical suspicion for this disease. With a moderate level of evidence, this meta-analysis confirms that nNO testing using velum closure maneuvers has diagnostic accuracy similar to EM and/or genetic testing for PCD when cystic fibrosis is ruled out. Thus, low nNO values accompanied by an appropriate clinical phenotype could be used as a diagnostic PCD test, though EM and/or genetics will continue to provide confirmatory information.
2:::Between June and August 2012, 426 divers participated in the control group of a randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention pre-dive checklist. The current nested analysis prospectively follows the control participants, who did not receive the intervention checklist. Poisson regression models with generalized estimating equations were used to estimate rate ratios comparing written checklist use with memorized and no checklist use.
3:::Slight to moderate agreement (κ=0.153) between μCT and OCT was obtained at an AI of 0° (Wilcoxon: p=0.02). With variation of Al a substantial agreement (κ=0.607) was observed (p=0.74). Spearmans correlation between both methods was 0.428 at 0°, 0.75 with varying AI and 0.573 with glycerine. Kappa values for intra-and inter-examiner analysis ranged between 0.81 and 0.88 and between 0.25 and 0.73, respectively.'
2:::All pathology reports at our institution that included bilateral salpingectomies from January 2006-December 2011 were examined in women >50years old in which the entire tube or the distal one-third was examined histologically with the complete (proximal and distal fallopian tube) or modified (distal one third of the tube) SEE-FIM protocol. Cases were divided into: Group 1, a history of or known risk factors (BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations) for HGSC and Group 2, those without these attributes for whom a STIC would be unexpected (incidental). Women undergoing unspecified ""risk-reducing"" procedures were included in Group 1.
3:::There was no significant difference in global or individual tumor infarction rate between embolizations with TAGMs and PVA particles (P = .73 and P = .3, respectively). Global infarction was not affected by age (P = .53), race (P = .12), number of leiomyomas (P = .72), or uterine volume (P = .74). Leiomyoma size did not influence individual tumor infarction (P = .41). Leiomyoma location was the sole factor that influenced individual tumor infarction rates, with pedunculated serosal tumors significantly less likely to show complete infarction than transmural tumors (odds ratio, 0.24; P = .01).
4:::Nonspherical PVA particles and TAGMs produce similar rates of uterine leiomyoma infarction. Complete infarction of individual tumors is less likely in serosal and pedunculated serosal tumors.
2:::The model included a decision tree and a Markov component. Health states considered in the decision tree were remission, response, no response, withdrawal due to adverse events, relapse, recovery, and recurrence. The time horizon was 24 months. Patients were on third-line treatment for up to a 3-month acute phase and a 6-month maintenance phase. As third-line efficacy data were not available, inputs were calculated by adjusting original second-line data to third-line based on proportionate reductions observed in STAR*D. Equivalent efficacy was assumed for all comparators. Healthcare resource use and utilities were based on UK estimates.
3:::Vortioxetine was a cost-effective treatment option at a threshold of £20,000/QALY vs. escitalopram, citalopram, sertraline, and was associated with more health benefits, less costs (was dominant) versus relevant third-line comparators venlafaxine and duloxetine. Agomelatine was found not to be a cost-effective option. The 22-month maintenance phase treatment scenario results were similar to the 6-month base case.
3:::Acemannan significantly increased pulp cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen, BMP-2, BMP-4, vascular endothelial growth factor, and dentin sialoprotein expression and mineralization approximately 1.4-, 1.6-, 1.6-, 5.5-, 2.6-, 3.8-, 1.8-, and 4.8-fold, respectively, compared with control. In vivo, partial pulpotomy treatment using acemannan generated outcomes similar to mineral trioxide aggregate treatment, resulting in mineralized bridge formation with normal pulp tissue without inflammation or pulp necrosis. In contrast, the formocresol group demonstrated pulp inflammation without mineralized bridge formation.
4:::Acemannan is biocompatible with the dental pulp. Furthermore, acemannan stimulated dentin regeneration in teeth with reversible pulpitis.
2:::Serial coronary CTA was performed in 96 CAD patients. Among 60 patients ≤40years, risk factor and coronary plaque analysis done using a 256- slice CT in 33 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was compared with 27 patients with chronic stable angina (CSA). Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed, for factors predicting ACS as an outcome among young CAD patients. In addition, quantitative and morphologic plaque characteristics were compared among those ≤40years and >40years.
3:::Bipolar patients had significantly higher risk of facture when compared to matched controls (17.6% versus 11.7%, respectively p<0.001). The hazard ratio (HR) was 1.33 (95% confidence interval [CI]＝1.23-1.48, p<0.001) after adjusting for covariates. Persons with bipolar disorder and a prior history of psychiatric hospitalization were had higher risk for bone fracture than those without prior history of psychiatric hospitalization when compared to match controls. Higher cumulative dose of antipsychotics or mood stabilizers did not increase the risk of fracture.
4:::Suicidal thoughts may be related to symptoms of anhedonia independent of other depressive symptoms. These results have implications for the potential mechanisms of action of ketamine on suicidal thoughts.
2:::Under different prevalence scenarios of overweight and obesity, the number of cancer cases in the Nordic countries in the next 30 years (i.e. 2016-2045) was estimated for 13 cancer sites and compared to the projected number of cancer cases if the prevalence stayed constant. The Prevent macro-simulation model was used.
3:::No obvious differences were observed in TA between these groups. The TL was 0.971 in PCOS group and 1.118 in non-PCOS group (P = 0.005). The patients with TL ≥1 accounted for 36.9% in PCOS group and 54.1% in non-PCOS group (P = 0.032). The average duration of infertility for PCOS patients was 5 years in TA <0.070 group and 4 years in TA ≥0.070 group (P = 0.038), and 5 years in TL <1 group and 3 years in TL ≥1 group (P = 0.006), respectively. No obvious differences were observed in IVF outcomes between these groups. No obvious differences were observed in TA, TL, or IVF outcomes between OCP pretreatment group and non-OCP pretreatment group in PCOS patients.
1:::Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired infections (IAI) result in increased hospital and ICU stay, costs and mortality. To date, no biomarker has shown sufficient evidence and ease of application in clinical routine for the identification of patients at risk of IAI. We evaluated the association of the systemic mRNA expression of two host response biomarkers, CD74 and IL10, with IAI occurrence in a large cohort of ICU patients.
2:::922 consecutive patients underwent CTA for suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients without atherosclerosis (n = 261) and in whom quantitative CTA analysis was not feasible due to image quality, step-artefacts or technical factors related to image acquisition or data storage (n = 153) were excluded. Thus, final study group consisted of 508 patients aged 63 ± 9 years. Coronary plaque location, severity and composition for each coronary segment were identified using automated CTA quantification software and integrated in a single CTA score (0-42). Adverse events (AE) including death, myocardial infarction (MI) and unstable angina (UA) were obtained from the national healthcare statistics.
4:::Comprehensive CTA risk score integrating the location, burden and composition of coronary atherosclerosis predicts future cardiac events in patients with suspected CAD.
3:::A total of 3,682,000 new cancer cases and 2,229,300 cancer deaths were estimated in China in 2013. Cancers of lung, female breast, stomach, liver, colon-rectum and esophagus were the most common cancers, accounting for about half of all cancer new cases. Lung cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer were the five leading causes of cancer death, accounting for about 60% of all cancer deaths. The cancer patterns showed differences not only between male and female, but also among different geographic regions in China. For overall cancers, the age-standardized incidence rates were stable during the past decades in male, but significantly increased by 2.2% per year in female.
3:::The average score of overall satisfaction was 7.3±1.9 (average±standard deviation) for this sample. For the care area, the average score was 7.6±2; for the quality of information provided, it was 7.5±2.5 and for UHSA functioning and organization, 7.0±2. Furthermore, 84.8 % of patients reported their wish to continue psychiatric care in prison and 77.6 % after release.
2:::We reviewed medical records of 4116 adult (≥16years old) outpatients with epilepsy at our centers for documentation of seizure clusters. Variables including patient demographics, epilepsy details, medical and psychiatric history, AED history, and epilepsy risk factors were then tested against history of seizure clusters. Patients were then divided into focal epilepsy, idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), or symptomatic generalized epilepsy (SGE), and the same analysis was run.
4:::This study shows the molecular characteristics of the FH patients included in the SAFEHEART registry and the relationship with the phenotypic expression. The majority of the genetic variants are considered to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic, which confers a high level of confidence to the entry and follow-up data analysis performed with this registry concerning FH patients prognosis, treatment and survival.'
3:::The self-rated health time series of frail elderly exhibited significantly elevated variance in the physical, mental, and social domain, as well as significantly stronger cross-correlations between all three domains, as compared to the nonfrail group (all P < 0.001). Temporal autocorrelation was not significantly associated with frailty.
2:::A retrospective chart review of a skull base oncology database was performed of patients with the diagnosis of clinical PNI from a cutaneous HNSCC. Patients who were previously untreated underwent multimodal treatment entailing surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) and patients who were previously treated with radiotherapy underwent salvage surgical resection between the years 2006 and 2012. Survival outcomes, such as disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), were analyzed and correlated with surgical factors, such as margin status, previous treatment, zone involvement, and trigeminal involvement (branch-specific), as well as the pretreatment and posttreatment pain scores.
4:::ADH on core biopsy with low risk of upgrade to cancer is defined by lack of individual cell necrosis, number of foci of ADH, and percent of imaging lesion removed. If these findings are validated, women whose biopsies meet low-risk criteria might be considered for prevention therapy and surveillance without surgical excision.
3:::Four of five studies that quantified expectations and satisfaction found a positive relationship between the two. This may indicate a possible trend, but as 16 of the 21 included publications did not provide quantifiable data, no firm conclusions are possible.
2:::The expression of GAS5 and microRNA 21 (miR-21) was detected in primary cervical cancer tissue specimens, as well as in cervical cancer cell lines. We identified the interaction of GAS5 and miR-21 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and dual-luciferase reporter assay. We also studied the functions of GAS5 in proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion in cervical cancer cells in vitro and vivo. Finally, the impact of GAS5 on cisplatin resistance and its mechanism in cervical cancer cells was also identified.
3:::The expression of GAS5 and miR-21 was detected in primary cervical cancer tissue specimens, as well as in cervical cancer cell lines. GAS5, which is a tumor suppressor playing roles in inhibiting the malignancy of cervical cancer cells, including proliferation in vivo and vitro, migration, and invasion, has a low expression in cervical cancer tissue and cervical cancer cell lines, whereas miR-21 expression is high. GAS5 significantly decreased the expression of miR-21, and there is a reciprocal repression of gene expression between GAS5 and miR-21. Besides, most importantly, we found that high expression of GAS5 and low expression of miR-21 can enhance the sensitivity of SiHa/cDDP cancer cells to cisplatin. A further experiment for identifying the mechanism of cisplatin resistance by GAS5 showed that GAS5 can not only regulate phosphatase and tensin homolog through miR-21 but also influence the phosphorylation of Akt.
4:::P38 MAPK pathway contributed to cognitive damage in PTZ-induced epilepsy via apoptosis cascade.
3:::The study cohort comprised of 910 patients (608 men: 302 women; median age 58 (IQR: 48-67) years with definite 848 (93%) or probable CP 62 (7%). Nicotine (70%) and alcohol (59%) were the most frequent aetiologies and seen in combination in 44% of patients. A history of recurrent acute pancreatitis was seen in 49% prior to the development of CP. Pain (69%) and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (68%) were the most common complications followed by diabetes (43%). Most patients (30%) were classified as clinical stage II (symptomatic CP with exocrine or endocrine insufficiency). Less than 10% of the patients had undergone pancreatic surgery.
2:::Databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Library) were searched (February 2016). Two researchers independently screened references and extracted data.
4:::This minimum data set should be easily integrated into clinical practice yet allow vital data to be collected internationally from primary care optometry. It should not be mistaken for a clinical guideline and should not add workload to the optometrist. A pilot study incorporating an additional Delphi stage prior to implementation is advisable to refine some response categories.
3:::Men attained greater peak values for VO2 and work rate (p < 0.05). Both groups of participants exhibited similar heart rate response to peak exercise and no sex differences were observed in VO2peak percentile or ventilatory threshold. HRR at 1 and 2 min of passive recovery was similar between sexes. In multiple linear models, VO2peak explained 11.2% of the variance in HRR1min both in men and women (p < 0.05). Most importantly, sex, VO2peak, and their interaction were all significant predictors of HRR2min (explained variance 29.2%) (p < 0.05).
2:::Adult male C57BL/6 mice were treated with increasing doses of the fixed oil obtained from the pulp of Caryocar coriaceum Wittm. Seizure activity was induced by PTZ (60 mg/kg, i.p.), and evaluated by behavioral and electrographic methods. Potential adverse effects were investigated in the open-field, rotarod, forced swim, or object recognition tests. The antioxidant potential of the oil was evaluated by the DPPH scavenging assay.
1:::Central sleep apnea (CSA) and Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) are highly prevalent in heart failure (HF) and are linked to increased mortality. Impaired pulmonary diffusion capacity [DLCO] and [KCO]) have been suggested to play a key role in CSA-CSR pathophysiology. This study investigated the relationship between HF, CSR, DLCO and KCO in well-characterized HF patients.
3:::- Of 422 patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, 176 (41.7%) underwent surgical lung biopsy or lung transplant. Forty-six of those 176 patients (26.1%) met IPAF criteria by initial pathology interpretation and a positive clinical or serologic feature. Of the remaining 130 patients, 73 (56.2%) met either the clinical or serologic domains without meeting the morphologic domain, whereas 36 (27.7%) had slides available for pathology rereview. This rereview demonstrated nonspecific interstitial pneumonia in 8 of 36 patients (22.2%) and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in 6 of 36 patients (16.7%), resulting in an additional 7 of 36 patients (19.4%) with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia that met the IPAF criteria. In IPAF, pulmonary vasculopathy was the most prevalent finding (45 of 84; 53.6%) and predicted increased mortality (hazard ratio, 2.5; P = .04).
4:::Survival and stability of OSPTX and OSP implants is comparable. Osteotomy preparation by either standard or soft bone surgical protocol presented no significant effect on implant survival and stability for the specific implant designs.
3:::Associations were greater in magnitude for serous OvCa than for all OvCa combined. Compared to never smokers, increased risk for serous OvCa was observed for lifetime ever smokers (1.46, 1.11-1.92), former smokers who quit within 0-2 years of diagnosis (5.48, 3.04-9.86), and for total pack-years smoked among lifetime ever smokers (0-5 pack-years: 1.79, 1.23-2.59; >5-20 pack-years: 1.52, 1.05-2.18; >20 pack-years: 0.98, 0.61-1.56); however, we observed no dose-response relationship with increasing duration or consumption and no significant associations among current smokers. Smoking was not significantly associated with mucinous OvCa. Associations for all OvCa combined were consistently elevated among former smokers. The proportion of ever smokers who quit within 0-2 years was greater among cases (23%) than controls (7%).
2:::A longitudinal, multicenter prospective study was carried out on 771 patients affected by pathological obesity. The following parameters were recorded for each patient before surgery: anthropometric, metabolic, social, smoking habits and previous failure of other bariatric procedures. After 1 follow-up year, final weight, final Body Mass Index (BMI), final percentage of lost excess body weight and percentage of lost BMI were evaluated.
3:::We identified 33 infants with abdominal wall defects born in the study time period. All cases were reclassified to 28 cases of gastroschisis, four cases of omphalocele, and there was 1 infant in the indeterminate group. The point prevalence at birth for gastroschisis increased significantly from 8 to 35 (average 10.7) per 10,000 liveborn and -stillborn infants. Mothers below 20 years of age represented 23% of all cases and the prevalence for this group was 17 per 10,000 liveborn and stillborn. Perinatal mortality for infants with gastroschisis was high (18%), and 1 year survival was 71%. For omphalocele, the prevalence varied from 8 to 11 per 10,000 liveborn and stillborn infants. There was no increasing rate in the period, further highlighting an etiological difference between gastroschisis and omphalocele.
2:::Here, we report a microdeletion of 170,6 Kb at Xp22.13 (17.733.948-17.904.576) (GRCh37/hg19), detected by array-based comparative genomic hybridization in an Italian boy with NHS syndrome.
4:::Plumbagin exerted its neuroprotective effects by effectively suppressing isoflurane-induced neuronal apoptosis via regulating BDNF-TrkB-PI3/Akt and ERK/JNK signalling.
3:::A total of 22 participants were enrolled, a median of 4 months after HIV acquisition. At baseline, there was substantial systemic and mucosal immune activation, and gut CD4 T-cell numbers, Th22 cell numbers, and Th17 cell function were reduced compared with controls. Early ART restored gut Th22 numbers, improved but did not restore overall CD4 numbers, and had no impact on Th17 function. Plasma levels of soluble CD14 and D-dimer normalized, whereas other inflammatory cytokines were reduced but not normalized. ART intensification had no impact on any blood or gut immune parameters.
2:::This prospective cohort study was conducted in 250 patients, aged 18-39 years, diagnosed with breast cancer and treated with adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Each patient underwent blood AMH measurement at each chemotherapy cycle, and at 6, 12 and 24 months after chemotherapy. Menses occurrence was also recorded.
3:::Transitioning to methamphetamine injection (AOR:2.16, p=0.004) and a newly positive HCV RNA test result (AOR:4.93, p=0.001) were both associated with increased odds of change to insufficient coverage, whilst change to utilising NSPs as the primary source of syringe acquisition (AOR: 0.41, p=0.003) and opioid substitution therapy (OST) enrolment (AOR:0.51, p=0.013) were protective against a change to insufficient coverage.
4:::GB surgery for overweight but not obese people with T2D appears to be cost-effective in the U.S. setting if weight loss endures for more than five years. Health utility gained from weight loss is a critical input to cost-effectiveness estimates and therefore should be routinely measured in populations undergoing bariatric surgery.
2:::A qualitative study design was employed. A total of 25 interviews with public sector staff (n=23) and private sector managers (n=2) were conducted to understand their interpretations of assumptions in the activities of private investors and service contractors participating in Local Improvement Finance Trust (LIFT) partnerships. Realist evaluation principles were applied in the data analysis to interpret the findings.
3:::Appropriate case selection was strongly recommended, and TaTME should be offered to patients with mid and low rectal cancers, but not proximal rectal cancers. Pre-requisites to learn TaTME should include completion of training and accreditation in laparoscopic colorectal surgery, with prior experience in transanal surgery. Ideally, two surgeons should undergo training together in centres with high volume for rectal cancer surgery. Mentorship and multidisciplinary training were the two most important aspects of the curriculum, which should also include online modules and simulated training for purse-string suturing. Mentors should have performed at least 20 TaTME cases and be experienced in laparoscopic training. Reviewing the specimens quality, clinical outcome data and entering data into a registry were recommended. Assessment should be an integral part of the curriculum using Global Assessment Scales, as formative assessment to promote learning and competency assessment tool as summative assessment.'
2:::A dynamic community-based cohort of patients with RA was studied (n = 1977). Clinical records were reviewed and cases of severe ExRA were identified. Information on exposure to TNF inhibitors was obtained from a regional register. Exposure to TNF inhibitors was analyzed in a time-dependent fashion and the incidence of severe ExRA in exposed patients was compared with the incidence in unexposed patients. Cox regression models were used to assess potential predictors of severe ExRA.
3:::Among the 143 ultra high-risk GTN patients, 94 (65.7%) patients had achieved complete remission and 15.9% (15/94) patients relapsed after complete remission. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of the entire cohort approached 67.9%. The results of the multivariate analysis revealed that non-molar antecedent pregnancy [Relative risk (RR) 4.689, 95% CI 1.448-15.189, P=0.010], brain metastases (RR 2.280, 95% CI 1.248-4.163, P=0.007), previous failed multiagent chemotherapy (RR 5.345, 95% CI 2.222-12.857, P=0.000) and surgery (RR 0.336, 95% CI 0.177-0.641, P=0.001) all had influence on the prognosis of ultra high-risk GTN patients.
4:::Incomplete or absent recanalization is associated with a higher incidence of PTS, probably as a consequence of deteriorated blood flow and increased venous pressure. This suggests early recanalization could improve the outcome of DVT treatment in selected patients.
3:::SET followed by an additional frozen-thawed single embryo transfer if available was dominant, less costly and more effective, over DET in women under 32 years. In women aged 32 or older DET was more effective than SET followed by an additional frozen-thawed single embryo transfer if available but also more costly.
2:::We included 70 consecutive DCM patients (pts) (48±12.1years, EF 24.4±7.4%) with new-onset (n=35, duration <6months) and chronic DCM (n=35, >6months). Markers of collagen type I and III synthesis - procollagens type I and III carboxy- and amino-terminal peptides (PICP, PINP, PIIICP, PIIINP), and ECM metabolism controlling factors - tumor growth factor beta-1 (TGF1-β), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) - were measured in serum at baseline, and at 3- and 12-month follow-up. All pts underwent endomyocardial biopsy to determine the presence and extent of ECM fibrosis.
4:::It can be concluded that MCP-1 and CCR2 polymorphisms are not associated with AgP in Turkish population. Although in AgP patients, there was AA genotype with MCP-1 mRNA expression it can be speculated that gene expression levels in peripheral blood may not reflect the cytokine/chemokine levels of local tissues.
3:::A total of 4031 patients with oesophageal cancer and 10,423 patients with gastric cancer were included. While the proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy decreased from 35.9% during the 3rd month before death to 7.9% in the final week (p < 0.001 for trend), the use of artificial nutrition rose from 9.6% to 16.0% of patients. During the last week before death, patients with stomach cancer were more likely to receive chemotherapy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.17-1.56) but less likely to receive artificial nutrition (aOR = 0.80, 95%CI = 0.73-0.88) than patients with cancer of the oesophagus. The adjusted rates of chemotherapy use during the last week of life varied from 1.6% in rural hospitals to 11.2% in comprehensive cancer centres, while the adjusted probability to receive artificial nutrition varied from 12.1% in private for-profit clinics up to 19.9% in rehabilitation care facilities (p < 0.001).
2:::Cross-sectional study.
4:::These results suggest that the fixed-dose regimen is not appropriate for ICU patients in view of the low incidence of target trough concentrations and the high incidence of supratherapeutic concentrations. The dose should be individualized based on weight, age, and renal function to improve outcomes and patient safety.
3:::The clinical presentation of melanoma was similar for PAM and non-PAM patients. There was no significant difference in recurrence between the 2 groups; for PAM patients, 38.5% of patients had recurrence, as compared with 36.6% of non-PAM patients (p = 0.641). For PAM patients, median follow-up was 14.6 years (range 0 to 42.6 years) and 11.1 years (0 to 48.5 years) for the non-PAM patients. No significant differences in DFS, MSS, or OS were identified on univariable or multivariable analysis for PAM vs non-PAM patients in stage 0/I/II and stage III cutaneous melanoma, respectively (p = 0.880 DFS, p = 0.219 OS, and p = 0.670 MSS).
3:::We found that the CXCR6 rs2234358 was associated with HCV spontaneous clearance in Chinese Han population (dominant model: adjusted OR=1.62, 95%CI: 1.30-2.01; additive model: adjusted OR=1.43, 95%CI: 1.20-1.70). Patients carrying GT/TT genotypes had increased sustained virological response compared with patients carrying the GG genotype (dominant model: adjusted OR=2.23, 95%CI: 1.26-3.95).
2:::Patients underwent lens phacoemulsification and were implanted bilaterally with a diffractive trifocal IOL: FineVision Micro F (PhysIOL SA, Liège, Belgium) or AT Lisa tri 839MP (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany). Surgeries were performed between 2011 and 2015 with at least 3 months of follow-up. Visual and refractive performance, patient satisfaction, and spectacle independence were evaluated.
4:::Compared with PAF and PerAF, LSPAF had a higher incidence of NPV triggers and worse long-term outcome after catheter ablation. NPV triggers and LAD independently predicted AF recurrence after catheter ablation in LSPAF.
1:::To evaluate potential biologic and thermal mechanisms of the observed differences in thrombosis rates between hepatic vessels during microwave (MW) ablation procedures.
3:::At baseline, 343 patients (40% of 858 assessed) had moderate to severe pain, and 347 (38% of 924) had depression. Pain increased the risk of depression (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.76-3.12). Using mixed model analyses, we found that a 1-point increase in pain was associated with a .48 increase in depression (p<.001). This association persisted in mild, moderate, and severe cognitive impairment. In those recently admitted, depressive symptoms decreased over time, and having less pain at follow-up was associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms (within-subject effect; p=.042).
2:::The ASDs were prepared by solvent evaporation with varying evaporation rates and were characterized by steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, confocal imaging, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy.
4:::There is significant disagreement between the IDS-iSYS and Roche Cobas assays for both reference markers. Consequently, the reference intervals for an adult, healthy population are different depending on the analysis method used. Therefore, repeated measurements of patient samples used for monitoring of treatment should be done on the same assay. Moreover, assay-specific reference intervals should be used. Harmonization of assays for BTM is highly warranted.
3:::In 77 shoulders with previously unrepaired irreparable tears, simple shoulder test (SST) scores improved from an average of 4.6 (range 0-12) to 8.5 (range 1-12) (p < 0.001). Fifty-four patients (70%) improved by at least the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) of 2 SST points. For 74 shoulders with irreparable failed prior repairs, SST scores improved from 4.0 (range 0-11) to 7.5 (range 0-12) (p < 0.001). Fifty-four patients (73%) improved by the MCID of 2 SST points.
2:::SVF cells were analyzed regarding cell yield, viability, adenosine triphosphate content, colony forming units and proliferative capacity, as well as surface marker profile and differentiation potential in vitro.
3:::The urinary concentrations were highest for 9-OHPhe (median at the range of 3661ng/L), followed by 2-OHNap (3189ng/L), 2-OHFlu (1116ng/L), and 1-OHPyr (250ng/L). In multiple linear regressions, being female (P=0.04), school location near a thermal power plant (P=0.02) and higher maternal age at birth (P<0.01) were associated with increased concentrations of urinary 1-OHPyr; no significant associations were found for 2-OHNap; school location near a thermal power plant (P<0.01) and lower family income (P<0.01) were associated with increased concentrations of urinary 2-OHFlu; higher age (P<0.01), school location near a thermal power plant (P=0.01), frequent consumption of smoked foods (P=0.04) and lower family income (P=0.07) were all found to be associated with increased concentrations of 9-OHPhe.
4:::Together, these findings indicate that there may be an association between OCD and cannabis misuse that is independent of anxiety, depression, and stress, and that is mediated by coping motives. Based on these findings, we recommend that individuals with OCD symptoms avoid using cannabis because they may be more vulnerable to the development of problematic use and cannabis use disorder.
2:::We performed a retrospective review of all admissions to our urban Level I trauma center from July 1, 2012, to June 30, 2015. All patients aged 16 years or older who were discharged alive were included. We identified all unplanned readmissions that occurred within 30 days of discharge and performed an extensive chart review to determine the reasons for readmission. We performed univariate and multivariable analyses.
3:::Among 680 patients, the median time from patient arrival to MT protocol activation was 9 minutes with a median time from MT activation call to delivery of first cooler of 8 minutes. An increase in both time to MT activation and time to arrival of first cooler were associated with prolonged time to achieving hemostasis (coefficient, 1.09; p = 0.001 and coefficient, 1.16; p < 0.001, respectively). Increased time to MT activation and time to arrival of first cooler were associated with increased mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; p = 0.009 and OR, 1.02; p = 0.012, respectively). Controlling for injury severity, physiology, resuscitation intensity, and treatment arm (1:1:1 vs. 1:1:2), increased time to arrival of first cooler was associated with an increased mortality at 24 hours (OR, 1.05; p = 0.035) and 30 days (OR, 1.05, p = 0.016).
2:::We describe a new ultralow risk threshold for the 70-gene signature (MammaPrint) that identifies a group of breast cancer patients with excellent 20 year, long-term survival prognosis. Tumors of these patients are referred to as ""indolent breast cancer."" We used patient series on which we previously established and assessed the 70-gene signature high-low risk threshold.
3:::Pharmacokinetic analysis of blood samples showed an overall filter efficiency of 86% (range 71.1-95.5%). The mean filter efficiency decreased from 95.4% 10 min after the start of melphalan infusion to 77.5% at the end of the procedure (p = 0.051). Bone marrow depression was seen after up to 80.0% of 10 procedures, but was self-limiting and mostly asymptomatic. No hypotension-related complications or procedure-related mortality occurred.
4:::Commercial gingival retraction products exhibit antimicrobial effects to various degrees in vitro. Some products display rapid bactericidal activity. The antimicrobial activity is not owing to the retraction-active agents. Biofilm bacteria are less sensitive to the antimicrobial effects of the agents.
3:::We observed increased expression of adenosine deaminase-like (Adal) in all 3 regions in CSS-2 mice. Moreover, we found that the adenosine deaminase inhibitor EHNA reduced the difference in alcohol preference between CSS-2 and C57BL/6J mice.
2:::We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 170 399 patients with type 2 diabetes aged ≥18 years who were registered in Shanghai community-based diabetes management system between 2004 and 2009. Their TB status was tracked until 31 December 2014. Cox regression was performed to identify the risk factors for TB.
4:::Our findings suggest that neighbourhood sanitation plays a key role in reducing diarrhoeal diseases and that increase in sanitation coverage may only have minimal impact on diarrhoeal illness, unless sufficiently high coverage is achieved.
3:::Eighty-one patients were included. Five (17.9%), 3 (11.1%), and 8 (30.8%) patients experienced failure at 1 year in groups AZA steady, AZA down and AZA stopped, respectively (P=.1 across the groups). The median trough levels of IFX at inclusion were close to those measured at the end of follow-up in group AZA steady (3.65 vs 3.45 μg/mL, P=.9) and in group AZA down (3.95 vs 3.60 μg/mL, P=.5), whereas these levels dropped from 4.25 to 2.15 μg/mL (P=.02) in group AZA stopped. Four (14.3%), four (14.8%) and 11 (42.3%) patients experienced an unfavourable evolution of IFX pharmacokinetics in groups AZA steady, AZA down and AZA stopped, respectively. A threshold of 6-TGN <105 pmoles/8.10(8) RBC was associated with an unfavourable evolution of IFX pharmacokinetics.
2:::DNA genotyping was performed on peripheral blood leukocytes in 274 patients with MDD and 273 age-and sex-matched controls. The frequency and severity of negative life events were assessed by the Life Events Scale (LES). A logistics method was employed to assess the gene-environment interaction (G×E).
3:::Twenty-three studies (19 trials) met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Sample sizes ranged from 69 to 452, and median patient age ranged from 45 to 53 years. There was a trend toward prolonged OS with cisplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab and topotecan-paclitaxel-bevacizumab compared with all non-bevacizumab-containing therapies. Cisplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab had the highest probability of being the most efficacious compared with all regimens (68.1%), and cisplatin monotherapy had the lowest (0%).
4:::The results of this network meta-analysis show that bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel-topotecan or paclitaxel-cisplatin is likely to prolong OS over other non-bevacizumab-containing chemotherapies (eg, paclitaxel-carboplatin), which were not included in the GOG240 trial. In patients with advanced, persistent, and recurrent cervical cancer, cisplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab and topotecan-paclitaxel-bevacizumab showed the highest efficacy in all regimens investigated in this analysis.
1:::Advanced stage at diagnosis is a common feature of breast cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), contributing to poor survival rates. Understanding its determinants is key to preventing deaths from this cancer in SSA.
3:::18 (16%) of the 113 patients and 8 (9%) of the 88 HER2-ve cases achieved pCR. Ki67 and IHC4 score were both positively associated with achievement of pCR (P < 10(-7) and P < 10(-9), respectively) and RCB0+1 (P < 10(-5) and P < 10(-9), respectively) following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in all patients. Rates of pCR+RCB1 were 45 and 66% in the highest quartiles of Ki67 and IHC4 scores, respectively. In ER+HER2-ve cases, pCR+RCB1 rates were 35% and in the highest quartile of both Ki67 and IHC4. There were no pCRs in the lower half of IHC4 or Ki67 scores.
2:::Participants included all long-stay nursing home residents enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B fee-for-service between 1/1/2008 and 12/31/2009 with follow-up through 12/31/2011. We compared the number of hip fractures identified using only Part A claims to (1) Part A plus Part B claims and (2) Part A and Part B claims plus discordant codes at contiguous fracture sites.
4:::Our new multiplex real-time PCR for protozoa presents a sensitive method applicable to dried samples. As proof of concept, it worked well on stools collected from Guinea-Bissauan children with diarrhoea. It provides an epidemiological tool for analysing dried specimens from regions poor in resources.
3:::CD4(+)T cells performed a more pro-inflammatory phenotype in adipose tissue in T2DM ApoE(-/-) mice in vivo. Restriction to CD4(+)T cell proliferation and polarization was manifested obviously weakened after co-cultured with T2DM ADSCs ex vivo. No obvious distinctions were found in morphology and growth type of both ADSCs. However, T2DM ADSCs acquired a pro-inflammatory immune phenotype, with secreting less PGE2 and expressing higher MHC-II and co-stimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80). Normal ADSCs could also obtain the phenotypic change after cultured with T2DM SVF supernatant.
2:::The HEV open reading frame (ORF)2 protein was purified from plant tissue by using immobilized metal-anion chromatography (IMAC). The recombinant protein was used to develop an in-house ELISA for testing anti-HEV antibodies in both human and swine sera. Thirty-six serum samples collected from patients with serologically proven HEV infection with commercial kits were tested for anti-HEV IgG antibodies by using the plant-expressed protein. Forty-five serum samples collected from apparently healthy pigs in Bulgarian farms were also tested.
3:::The prevalence of current asthma was 11%. Well-controlled asthma was reported by 15% of the adolescents, and 53% had partly controlled asthma. The prevalence of uncontrolled asthma was significantly higher among girls than boys (38% vs 25%), and girls also reported lower HRQoL scores. There was a fairly strong correlation between the ACT and DISABKIDS scores. Independent risk factors for low HRQoL impact (a score <67) were female sex (OR 4.66, 95%CI 1.82-9.54) and decreased ACT scores (1.38, 1.18-1.62). Risk factors for low HRQoL worry (a score <70) were female sex (3.33, 1.41-7.86), decreased ACT scores (1.35, 1.16-1.57), severe asthma (6.23, 1.46-16.50), and having current eczema (2.68, 1.00-7.24).
4:::We provide proof of concept that a semiquantitative urine assay measuring levels of TFV could be further developed into a point-of-care test and be a useful tool to monitor adherence to PrEP.
2:::An explorative prospective multicenter cohort study in the Maastricht University Medical Centre+ and Zuyderland Medical Centre will be performed in 66 patients. Before, during, and after three cycles of systemic treatment with capecitabine or TAS-102, fecal samples and questionnaires (concerning compliance and chemotoxicity) will be collected. The response will be measured by CT/MRI using RECIST-criteria. Fecal microbiota composition will be analyzed with 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing. The absolute bacterial abundance will be assessed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Multivariate analysis will be used for statistical analysis.
3:::After stretching, maximal voluntary torque similarly decreased for both muscle groups. Passive torque significantly decreased on triceps surae and remained unchanged on quadriceps muscles. Fascicle length increased similarly for both muscles. However, myotendinous junction elongation remained unchanged for gastrocnemius medialis and increased significantly for rectus femoris muscle. Fascicle stiffness index significantly decreased on medial gastrocnemius and remained unchanged on rectus femoris muscle. In contrast, myotendinous junction stiffness index similarly decreased on both muscles.
3:::The infarcts were mainly subendocardial (81%) and relatively small (median MRI infarct mass 7.4 g). The automatic segmentation showed excellent agreement with expert segmentation on volume and area measurements (ICC = 0.96 and 0.87, respectively). DSC showed moderately good agreement (DSC = 0.47). Compared to MRI there was modest agreement (ICC = 0.62) and excellent correlation (R = 0.9). Manual interaction was less than 1 min per exam.
2:::We genotyped 879 patients with high-risk stable CAD and created a GRS based on 45 single nucleotide polymorphisms previously reported to be associated with CAD in genome-wide association studies. Patients were categorised into high or low GRS according to the median GRS and followed for recurrent cardiovascular events using national Danish registries. The primary endpoint was a composite of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularisation, and cardiovascular death.
4:::The results of this work highlighted the need of continuous biomonitoring of those contaminants considered a past issue along with the emergent ones.
3:::- Implementation is best approached in phases. Early efforts are directed toward identifying initial clinical applications and assembling an implementation team. Scanner selection should be based on intended use and budget. Recognizing pathologist concerns over the use of digital pathology for diagnostic purposes, ensuring adequate training, and performing appropriate validation studies will enhance adoption. Once implemented, the transition period from glass slide to image-based diagnostics will be associated with challenges, especially those related to a hybrid glass slide-digital slide workflow.
1:::Models relating perimetric sensitivities to ganglion cell numbers have been proposed for combining structural and functional measures from patients with glaucoma. Here we compared seven models for ability to differentiate progressing and stable patients, testing the hypothesis that the model incorporating local spatial scale would have the best performance.
4:::Data suggest that incidental irradiation of the heart in cases of left breast/chest wall RT can result in early post-RT perfusion defects on cardiac SPECT. There appears to be strong dose/volume dependence to the risk, and hence techniques to reduce cardiac exposure are recommended.
2:::This was a single-center, IRB-approved, retrospective, case series review conducted between October 2008 and October 2014. Data included symptomatology, microbiology of symptomatic LC in men post-robotic prostatectomy and PLND. Those with infected LC were compared to those men with symptomatic LC in the absence of infection.
3:::PCB151 increased the odds for incident diabetes, whereas hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was protective after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, sample storage characteristics, glucose and lipid levels. Associations between incident diabetes and polychlorinatedbiphenyl (PCB) or persistent pesticide (PST) components were mostly positive but non-significant. Among the cases, 29 developed ESRD and 48 died without ESRD. PCB28, PCB49 and PCB44 increased the risk of ESRD after adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. Several PCBs and PSTs increased the risk of death without ESRD. The principal components analysis identified PCBs with low-chlorine load positively associated with ESRD and death without ESRD, and several PSTs associated with death without ESRD.
3:::The validity of self-reported genitalia staging for boys was modest (r = 0.50; 95% CI,  0.31-0.65) and inferior to physician assessment (r = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56-0.93). Breast stage was well reported (r = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79-0.97) and superior to physician assessment (r = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.89). Pubic hair stage reported by boys (r = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.79-0.99) and girls (r = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.96-1.00) was superior to physician assessment (r = 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57-0.97 and r = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83-0.97, respectively).
4:::Among those with relatively survivable combat-related burns (<60% TBSA), genital/perineal/buttock involvement increases the risk of death. Bacteremia may account for part of this increased risk, but does not fully explain the independent risk associated with perineal burns.
2:::Monthly male and female live births by race and birth order for the entire US were obtained for 2007-2015 with birth order as 1-≥6 for these races.
3:::Sound patency assessed by sonotubometry was well correlated with the cross-sectional area at the narrowest portion of the ET in the sitting position (r = 0.786, p < 0.001). Correlation between the sound patency via the narrow tube and the caliber of the tube was also confirmed by the model experiment.
2:::In total, 21 patients (8 women, 13 men; age range 42-73 years) were included in this study. We determined markers for dermal M1 (inducible nitric oxide synthase and CD68) and M2 (markers: CD163 and CD206) macrophages using double immunohistochemistry to reduce the error rate, and then counted the cells.
4:::The use of EBUS-TBNA meant that distant metastatic biopsy was avoided in 81% of cases, performing well irrespective of cancer stage, node size, and facilitating mutation testing. Neck ultrasound failed to detect N3 disease in patients with bulky mediastinal disease. EBUS-TBNA had a sensitivity of 33% for metastases in PET negative nodes, highlighting PET limitations.
3:::410/727 participants submitted ≥1 stool sample and 40 (9.8%) carried toxigenic C. difficile in the first sample taken. Ribotype 106 was identified three times and seven other ribotypes twice. No ribotype 027 strains were identified. Independent predictors of colonization were previous C. difficile infection (OR 4.53 (95% C.I. 1.33-15.48) and malnutrition (MUST score ≥2) (OR 3.29 (95% C.I. 1.47-7.35)). Although C. difficile colonised patients experienced higher 90-day mortality, colonization was not an independent risk for death.
1:::The study aimed to define CDEs for disease characteristics and outcomes of LSS using the World Health Organizations ICF taxonomy, and to facilitate the selection of assessment instruments for research and clinical care.'
2:::Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent SC following stoma formation for NEC between Jan 2009 and July 2015 was done. Early (EC) versus late closure (LC) was defined as less than 10 weeks versus at or after 10 weeks of stoma formation.
3:::Forty-one patients (mean age: 13.7 years: 4.6-18.9 years) were evaluated. Mean BMI was 21.2 (range: 13-40.2); 10 patients (24.3%) were either overweight or obese. Final diagnoses were Crohn disease (n=24), ulcerative colitis (n=4) and normal/non-inflammatory bowel disease-related diagnoses (n=13). US demonstrated sensitivity of 67% and 78% and specificity of 78% and 83%, by Reader 1 and Reader 2, respectively. MRE sensitivity and specificity were 75% and 100%, respectively, compared to final clinicopathological diagnosis. Interobserver agreement between Reader 1 and Reader 2 was good (0.6< kappa <0.8).
4:::In this large cross-continental study, comorbidity in OCD was common. The high rates of comorbid major depression and anxiety disorders emphasize the need for clinicians to assess and monitor for these disorders. Earlier ages of onset of OCD, specific phobia and social phobia may indicate some relatedness between these disorders, but this requires further study. Although there do not appear to be significant cultural variations in rates or patterns of comorbidity and suicidality, further research using similar recruitment strategies and controlling for demographic and clinical variables may help to determine whether any sociocultural factors protect against suicidal ideation or psychiatric comorbidity in patients with OCD.
3:::Near infrared imaging and immunochemistry showed that fluorescent ANV and ANV-6L15 specifically localized to injured carotid artery and significant amount of ANV-6L15 remained bound to the injured artery after 24-h. Peri-procedure injections of TAP-ANV or ANV-6L15 resulted in decrease of intima/media ratio by 56%. Extended injections of both yielded similar results. Both decreased the expression of PCNA on day-7 and increased the expression calponin on day-14 in the intima post-balloon-injury.
2:::Data from the Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II (FDS2; n=1551, mean age 65.7years, 51.9% males) and Busselton Diabetes Study (BDS; n=186, mean age 70.2years, 50.0% males) cohorts, and from 186 matched BDS participants without diabetes, were analyzed. The prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin ≤130g/L males, ≤120g/L females) was determined in each sample. In FDS2, associates of anemia were assessed using multiple logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards modeling identified predictors of death during 4.3±1.2years post-recruitment.
4:::This study tracks the maturational patterns of global and regional deformation by two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography in extremely preterm infants from birth to 1 year CA. The maturational patterns are ventricular specific. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypertension leave a negative impact on RV and IVS strain, while LV strain remains stable.
3:::AMHs Lagar Velho 1 and Qafzeh 10 share delayed incisor development, but exhibit considerable idiosyncratic variation within and across tooth types, relative to each other and to the reference samples. Neanderthals Dederiyeh 1 and Le Moustier 1 exhibit delayed incisor coupled with advanced molar development, but differences are reduced when femoral diaphysis length is considered. Dental development in KNM-WT 15,000 Homo erectus/ergaster, while advanced for his age, almost exactly matches the predictions once femoral length is included in the models.
2:::In this study, 128 IDC patients who underwent pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET/CT and surgical resection of primary tumor with sentinel lymph node biopsy, ALN dissection, or both were analyzed. All the patients were classified as five molecular subtypes. The optimal cutoff values of pSUVmax for all the patients and each molecular subtype for the prediction of ALN metastasis were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Furthermore, the prognostic accuracy of ALN metastasis was assessed using c-statistics.
3:::In the varus-OA group, the incidence of abnormal internal rotation of the talus was 45% (43 ankles), which corresponded to an incidence of 32% (16 ankles) in the moderate-OA subgroup and 59% (27 ankles) in the severe-OA subgroup (p = 0.013).
4:::The results suggested that some serum peptides are involved in the pathophysiology of psoriasis, regulating the secretion of inflammatory chemokines and an antimicrobial protein. The modulation of serum peptides may be a potential therapeutic strategy for psoriasis.
3:::We identified 9 relevant studies with 29,327 participants. Among studies of severe AS, there was no significant difference in mortality (RR: 1.49, 95%CI:0.85-2.61; P=0.16) associated with non-cardiac surgery, but there was a significant increase in the composite adverse outcome (RR: 2.30, 95%CI:1.33-3.97; P=0.003). When the analysis involved any other degree of AS, eight studies were included and the pooled results showed a significant increase in composite adverse outcome (RR: 1.64, 95%CI:1.23-2.19; P<0.001) and myocardial infarction (RR: 1.90, 95%CI:1.54-2.34; P<0.001). When patients with asymptomatic AS were considered, the pooled results of four studies suggested an increased risk of composite adverse outcomes (RR: 1.59, 95%CI:1.19-2.12; P=0.002) but not mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure or stroke.
2:::A clinical retrospective study was performed on 47 ears with chronic otitis media which has relatively limited attic lesions have the small, sclerotic and hypocellular mastoids according to the preoperative high-resolution CT scan of the temporal bone that underwent MCWD and 32 ears with typical canal wall down operation form January 2010 to January 2016.
3:::Mean age was 66.4 ± 11.0 years, mean arm circumference was 32.7 ± 3.7 cm, 54% were female and 78% had hypertension. Mean BPs were 125.7 ± 14.0/73.9 ± 10.4 mm Hg for home BP devices vs. 129.0 ± 14.7/72.9 ± 9.3 for auscultation (difference of -3.3 ± 7.3/0.9 ± 6.1; P values <0.0001 for systolic and 0.17 for diastolic). The proportion of devices with systolic or diastolic BP differences from auscultation of ≥5, 10, and 15 mm Hg was 69%, 29%, and 7%, respectively. Increasing arm circumference was a statistically significant predictor of higher systolic (parameter estimate 0.61 per cm increase; P value 0.004) and diastolic (0.38; 0.03) BP.
2:::We retrospectively analyzed a prospective cohort of 672 patients with spontaneous ICH and documented demographic characteristics, stroke severity, and neuroimaging parameters. Consecutive hourly BP recordings allowed for computation of SBP, DBP, PP, and MAP. Threshold BP values that transitioned patients from survival to death were determined from ROC curves. Using in-hospital mortality as outcome, BP parameters were evaluated with multivariable logistic regression analysis.
4:::LRR was infrequent among T1-2N0i+/N1mi patients treated with mastectomy without PMRT, with no axillary failures, suggesting that PMRT or nodal radiotherapy are not routinely indicated in this population.
3:::Compared to placebo, GHB increased CSD of theta oscillations (5-7 Hz) in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and alpha1 (8-10 Hz) oscillations in the anterior cingulate cortex. Higher blood plasma values were associated with higher LPS values of delta (2-4 Hz) oscillations between the PCC and the right inferior parietal lobulus. Additionally, GHB decreased GOC of alpha1 oscillations.
2:::A prospective longitudinal study of a population-based cohort of 160 patients with RA and a population-based cohort of 1391 persons without RA (non-RA cohort) was performed. Each participant underwent 2-dimensional, pulsed-wave tissue Doppler echocardiography at baseline and after 4 to 5years of follow-up. Age- and sex-adjusted linear regression models were used to test for differences between the RA and non-RA cohorts in annualized rates of change for echocardiographic parameters.
3:::Mean saliva-to-plasma concentration ratios were 0.623 (ABC), 0.024 (TFV), 0.065 (DRV), and 0.0135 (RAL), which agree with the plasma protein binding rates except TFV. Significant correlations were evident between saliva and plasma concentrations of ABC, DRV, and RAL.
2:::Thirty-nine Danish women who underwent legal termination of pregnancy before gestational week 12 were included; 24 maternal blood samples were obtained together with 34 placental samples and 108 foetal organs. PFASs and cotinine were assayed by liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole mass spectrometry.
3:::Among 243 patients reporting a history of IPAA, 199 (82%) reported a history of pouch symptoms. Patients with recent pouch symptoms demonstrated higher mean T-scores in pain interference (53.0 versus 45.3; P < 0.001), depression (51.0 versus 46.4; P = 0.002), and fatigue (56.3 versus 47.0; P < 0.001). Symptomatic pouch patients reported lower mean scores in social role satisfaction (47.4 versus 54.6) and short IBD questionnaire (4.8 versus 5.8) (both P < 0.001). These differences were all clinically meaningful.
4:::In a large sample of patients with IBD, nearly all patients with IPAA reported a history of pouch symptoms. Patients experiencing symptoms within the 6 months before the survey assessment demonstrated clinically meaningful decrements in patient-reported outcomes in multiple domains of physical and psychosocial functioning.
2:::The physicochemical properties of the prepared solid dispersions were examined using SEM, TEM, DSC, XRD and FT-IR. In vitro dissolution profile of the solid dispersions was recorded and compared with that of the pure piperine and physical mixtures. The effect of these carriers on the aqueous solubility of piperine has been investigated.
3:::At the 12-month follow-up, bone mineral density in the lumbar spine area of these patients increased by 3.2%, while bone mineral density in the hip area showed no significant increase. At the 28-month follow-up, 25 patients were still included in this study. Femoral BMD at 28 months increased significantly from the 12-month follow-up (P = 0.0259), though the first 12 months showed no significant increase. LS BMD continued to increase through the 28-month period.
4:::Our results suggest a regionally and dependence-specific influence of cannabis use on the hippocampus. Hippocampal alteration in cannabis users was specific to the CA and DG regions and confined to dependent users.
2:::We included 303 patients treated with amiodarone between 1984 and 2007. AIT was defined as a lowered TSH level with an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) and AIH was defined as an elevated TSH level with a decreased or subnormal FT4. Subclinical AIT was defined as a lowered TSH level with a normal FT4 and subclinical AIH as an elevated TSH level with a normal FT4.
3:::200 men and 103 women, aged 62 ± 12.0 years, suffering from atrial (260) or ventricular (43) arrhythmias, were evaluated. During a median follow-up of 2.8 (1.0-25) years, 44 patients developed AIT and 33 AIH. In 42 (55%) patients who developed AIT/AIH, earlier thyroid function tests showed no subclinical AIT or subclinical AIH. In 35 (45%) patients, AIT/AIH was preceded by subclinical AIT or subclinical AIH (16/44 for AIT and 19/33 for AIH).
2:::Three Prognostic Assessment of Life and Limitations After Trauma in the Elderly centers not submitting subjects to the GTOS validation study identified subjects aged 65 years to 102 years admitted from 2000 to 2013. GTOS was specified using the formula [GTOS = age + (Injury Severity Score [ISS] × 2.5) + 22 (if transfused packed red cells (PRC) at 24 hours)]. TRISS uses the Revised Trauma Score (RTS), dichotomizes age (<55 years = 0 and ≥55 years = 1), and was specified using the updated 1995 beta coefficients. TRISS Penetrating was specified as [TRISSP = -2.5355 + (0.9934 × RTS) + (-0.0651 × ISS) + (-1.1360 × Age)]. TRISS Blunt was specified as [TRISSB = -0.4499 + (0.8085 × RTS Total) + (-0.0835 × ISS) + (-1.7430 × Age)]. Each then became the sole predictor in a separate logistic regression model to estimate probability of mortality. Model performances were evaluated using misclassification rate, Brier score, and area under the curve.
3:::Demographics (mean + SD) of subjects with complete data (N = 10,894) were age, 78.3 years ± 8.1 years; ISS, 10.9 ± 8.4; RTS = 7.5 ± 1.1; mortality = 6.9%; blunt mechanism = 98.6%; 3.1 % of subjects received PRCs. The penetrating trauma subsample (n = 150) had a higher mortality rate of 20.0%. The misclassification rates for the models were GTOS, 0.065; TRISSB, 0.051; and TRISSP, 0.120. Brier scores were GTOS, 0.052; TRISSB, 0.041; and TRISSP, 0.084. The area under the curves were GTOS, 0.844; TRISSB, 0.889; and TRISSP, 0.897.
4:::Transthoracic echocardiography and lung ultrasound are noninferior to chest x-ray for screening of pneumothorax and accurate central venous catheter positioning. Thus, the point of care use of ultrasound can reduce central venous catheter insertion to use time, exposure to radiation, and improve patient safety.
1:::Sacral nerve and tibial nerve stimulation have been singly used to treat overactive bladder (OAB). This study evaluated the effects of both combined stimulation on treating bladder overactivity in pigs and explored a novel treatment modality for OAB.
3:::Out of 148 persons with migraine, 100 (67%) suffered from co-existing tension-type headache and neck pain. Only 11% suffered from migraine only. Persons with migraine and co-existing tension-type headache and neck pain had lower level of physical activity and psychological well-being, higher level of perceived stress and poorer self-rated health compared to healthy controls. They reported reduced ability to perform physical activity owing to migraine (high degree), tension-type headache (moderate degree) and neck pain (low degree). The most burdensome condition was migraine, followed by tension-type headache and neck pain.
2:::Data from patients treated at eight paediatric diabetes units with experienced diabetes teams between June and December 2014 were analysed in an observational prospective study. Variables included: age, sex, diabetes duration, number of follow-up visits/year, anthropometrical data, insulin treatment modalities, mean annual HbA1c and the prevalence of acute and chronic complications. SPSS statistics 21.0 was used.
4:::Different oral medications used by diabetic patients have different persistence rates. Good persistence for any one medication is an indicator of good persistence to other medications. Investment in enhancing medication persistence in persons with diabetes may improve persistence to other medications, as well as improve glycemic control.
3:::Median follow-up was 3.8 months, and median overall survival was 3.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-4.7 months). Multivariate analysis demonstrated maximum tumor size ≥ 10 cm (hazard ratio [HR] 1.58; 95% CI, 1.02-2.46; P = .041), multifocal intrahepatic tumors (HR 1.55; 95% CI, 1.03-2.33; P = .037), and portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) (HR 1.81; 95% CI, 1.12-2.91; P = .015) as significant predictors of overall survival. Based on these factors, a scoring equation was developed to predict treatment outcome of transarterial chemoembolization, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 in predicting 6-month survival. Using a cutoff score of 5.5, patients with HCC and EHS were divided into 2 groups with significantly different overall survival (8.1 months for EHS1 and 2.4 months for EHS2; P < .001). The described method of subgrouping remained discriminatory regardless of baseline characteristics.
2:::The University of Vermont Medical Center almost exclusively used spinal anesthesia for infant pyloromyotomy surgery between 2008 and 2013, while Columbia University Medical Center relied on general anesthesia. The primary outcome assessed was the percentage change in intraoperative heart rate and blood pressure (systolic [SBP] and mean [MAP] blood pressure) from baseline. Analysis was performed using t-tests for continuous variables, followed by linear regression to account for differences in demographic and clinical covariates.
3:::A total of 2783 singleton pregnancies among 1712 female survivors of childhood cancer were identified in HES. Wilms tumor survivors treated with abdominal radiotherapy were at threefold risk of hypertension complicating pregnancy (relative risk = 3.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.29 to 4.71), while all survivors treated with abdominal radiotherapy were at risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (RR = 3.35, 95% CI = 1.41 to 7.93) and anemia complicating pregnancy (RR = 2.10, 95% CI = 1.27 to 3.46) compared with survivors treated without radiotherapy. Survivors treated without radiotherapy had similar risks of pregnancy and labor complications as the general population, except survivors were more likely to opt for an elective cesarean section (RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.16 to 1.70).
4:::The CT score nomogram discriminated well between indolent and aggressive renal masses. The model had a reasonable calibration in our cohort for discriminating indolent from aggressive lesions. Further research to validate and assess the nomogram is required.
3:::The single-cell qRT-PCR experiments indicated the reduced SK channel mRNA expression in PBOO UBSM cells. Patch-clamp studies revealed that NS309 had a diminished effect on resting membrane potential hyperpolarization via the activation of SK channels in PBOO UBSM cells. Moreover, attenuated whole-cell SK channel currents were demonstrated in PBOO UBSM cells.
1:::As clinical studies have correlated RANK expression levels with survival in breast cancer, and that RANK signaling is dependent on its cognate ligand RANKL, we hypothesized that dual protein expression further stratifies the poor outcome in TNBC.
2:::Between 2013 and 2015, PMRT was delivered to 116 patients (66 mastectomy alone, 50 IBR). PMRT was delivered with a median dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Left-sided patients were treated in breath-hold under image guidance. Differences in dosimetric parameters and time to the initiation of PMRT were assessed between patients with and without reconstruction.
4:::The addition of a surfactant to NaOCl and/or PUI activation increased palatal mucosa dissolution within artificial grooves in the root canal of incisor teeth. PUI agitation was often able to compensate for the absence of surfactants.
3:::Overall, 17 (28.3%) specimens presented microcracks before instrumentation. Apical microcracks were present in 1 (ProTaper Universal for Hand Use), 3 (Hyflex CM), and 2 (Reciproc) specimens when the instrumentation terminated at the AF. When instrumentation was terminated at AF - 1 mm, apical microcracks were detected in 3 (ProTaper Universal for Hand Use) and 4 (Hyflex CM and Reciproc) specimens. All these microcracks detected after root canal preparation were already present before instrumentation, and no new apical microcrack was visualized. For all groups, the number of slices presenting microcracks after root canal preparation was the same as before canal preparation.
2:::We interviewed 42 Deaf women selected by non-probability snowball sampling, using a structured questionnaire in South African Sign Language in Cape Town in July 2016.
3:::Intraoperative distances D1 and D2 were correlated with the width of the oval window and with the facial-promontory angle measured on imaging. CT scan measurements of the facial-promontory angle and width of the oval window were associated with the degree of discomfort of the surgeon. The cut-off threshold for intraoperative subjective discomfort was computed as 1.1 mm for the width of the oval window niche, with a sensibility of 71% and a specificity of 84%.
4:::The present study increases the external validity of dual-task gait assessment of MCI. Differences in dual-task gait speed appears to be largely attributable to executive attention processes. These findings have clinical implications as they demonstrate expected patterns of gait-brain behavior relationships in response to a cognitive dual task within a clinically representative population. Cognitive load dual-task gait assessment may provide a cost efficient and sensitive measure to detect older adults at high risk of a dementia disorder. (JINS, 2017, 23, 493-501).
2:::A systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A duplicate search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases was performed, beginning from the database inception dates through July 2016, for all articles evaluating the return to play after OAT for OCD lesions of the capitellum. A methodological quality assessment was completed for all included studies. Patient demographics, osteochondral lesion and graft characteristics, the number of patients, and timing of return to competitive activity were collected and evaluated. Association between graft size/number, the time to osseous healing, and return to sport was evaluated.
3:::Compared baseline characteristics with normal albumin group, subjects in low albumin group are older, having more diabetic patients, lower hemoglobin level, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, lower total cholesterol level, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and higher blood glucose. While there is no significant difference of total CV events between two groups, low serum albumin concentration is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (10.2% vs. 0.5%, p<0.001) and hard CV events (7.1% vs. 1.4%, p<0.001). The association remains significant after adjustments for confounders (all-cause mortality, HR: 6.81, 95% CI: 1.01-45.62; hard CV events, HR: 3.68, 95% CI: 1.03-13.19).
2:::This French multicenter retrospective survey called for observations on behalf of the Club Rhumatismes et Inflammations, with a standardized questionnaire established by the investigators.
3:::We included 14 patients (women: 10/14; median age at SpA diagnosis: 43.5 yrs, ranging from 19 to 63). Subtypes of SpA were ankylosing spondylitis (n = 11), psoriatic arthritis (n = 2), and synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome (n = 1). HLA-B27 was positive in 3 cases, negative in 9, and unknown in 2. SpA was diagnosed before TA in 13 cases. Imaging findings compatible with the diagnosis of TA were found with computed tomography (11/14) and/or Doppler ultrasound (10/14). Laboratory tests showed increased acute-phase reactants in all cases (C-reactive protein ≥ 25 mg/l in 71% of the cases). All patients except 1 received corticosteroids and 7 were treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF).
4:::A study such as the one conducted here, in which meteorological analysis of synoptic situations which favour Saharan dust intrusions, is combined with the effect on health at a city level, would seem to be crucial when it comes to analysing the differentiated mortality pattern in situations of Saharan dust intrusions.
3:::The incidence of MACE and mortality for the entire population was 0.4% (7 patients) and 1.7% (29 patients); 218 patients (13%) had a history of CAD: 106 previous AMI, 55 angina, 32 CABG, and 81 PCI. The propensity score yielded 2 well-balanced groups of 218 pairs with and without CAD. MACE (CAD 2 [0.9%] vs no-CAD 1 [0.5%]; P = 1), cardiovascular and pulmonary complications (CAD 61 [28%] vs no-CAD 51 [23%]; P = .3) and postoperative stay (CAD 7.3 days vs no-CAD 6.2 days; P = .3) were not different between the groups. The incidence of atrial fibrillation (CAD 31 [14%] vs no-CAD 18 [8.2%]; P = .07), 30-day mortality (CAD: 11 [5%] vs no-CAD 2 [0.9%]; P = .02) and death among complicated patients (CAD 18% vs no-CAD 3.9%; P = .009) were higher in the CAD group.
2:::The study included patients with planned surgery for inguinal hernia repair, anal fissure, hemorrhoid and pilonidal sinus excision. The study included a total of 210 patients of ASA I-II, aged 18-65 years. Patients were evaluated in respect of demographic characteristics, smoking and alcohol consumption, ASA grade and educational level. Correlations were evaluated between the number of attempts at spinal anesthesia and anesthesia history with vasovagal symptoms and educational level, gender, smoking and alcohol consumption and anesthesia history with anxiety scores. The instant (transient) state anxiety inventory part of the Transient State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (State Trait Anxiety Inventory - STAI) was used to determine the anxiety levels of the participants. Clinical findings of peripheral vasodilation, hypotension, bradycardia and asystole observed during the administration of spinal anesthesia were recorded.
3:::All curves consisted of a non-linear part at the beginning and a linear part from about 80N onwards. In full extension, median stiffness in the cadavers was 26.6N/mm for the medial compartment and 31.6N/mm for the lateral compartment. The values for in vivo were 25.7N/mm for the medial compartment and 25.3N/mm for the lateral compartment (p=0.684 for the medial compartment and p=0.247 for the lateral compartment). In 90° of flexion, median stiffness in the cadaver group was 24.7N/mm for the medial compartment and 22.2N/mm for the lateral compartment. In vivo, median stiffness was 30.3N/mm for the medial compartment and 29.2N/mm for the lateral compartment (p=0.009 for the medial compartment and p=0.143 for the lateral compartment).
4:::The DSM-5 narrower, non-overlapping definition of mixed episodes resulted in fewer patients who met mixed criteria compared to DSM-IV.
2:::Altogether 18 WNT1 mutation-positive (age range 11-76years, median 49years) and 14 mutation-negative subjects (10-77years, median 43years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine. The images were reviewed for spinal alignment, vertebral compression fractures, intervertebral disc changes and possible endplate deterioration. The findings were correlated with clinical data.
3:::The interaction of Piroxicam and its copper complex with histone/chromatin results in structural alterations. Such structural alterations can have different biological manifestations, but to test our hypothesis, we have focused only on the accompanied modulations at the epigenomic/genomic level. The complex, showed alteration of key epigenetic signatures implicated in transcription in the global context, although Piroxicam caused no significant changes. We have correlated such alterations caused by the complex with the changes in global gene expression and validated the candidate gene expression alterations.
2:::This is an ancillary analysis of a cohort study analyzing health-related outcomes in women who underwent primary surgical management of a suspected gynecologic malignancy between 10/2013 and 10/2014. Subjects completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Sexual Function and Satisfaction Questionnaire (PROMIS-SFQ) preoperatively and questions on sexual interest and desire at one, three, and six months postoperatively. Bivariate tests and multiple linear regression were used to analyze data.
3:::Of 231 women who completed a baseline PROMIS-SFQ, 187 (81%) completed one-month, 170 (74%) three-month, and 174 (75%) six-month follow-up interviews. Following surgery, 71% of enrolled subjects were diagnosed with a malignancy. Women age <55 had a greater decrease in sexual interest from baseline to one month than women age >55 (-5.5±1.0 vs -2.3±0.9, p=0.02). In a multivariable analysis, age <55 remained associated with a larger decrease in sexual interest at one month postoperatively (-4.6, 95% CI: -1.8, -7.4), as did having cancer vs benign disease for women of all ages (-5.6, 95% CI: -9.6, -1.5).
4:::This study provides new data regarding the timing and magnitude of changes in sexual interest following gynecologic oncology procedures.
1:::To investigate non-contrast MRI findings of clinical adhesive capsulitis.
2:::We comprehensively searched Medline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE from inception to November 2015. We included all studies reporting data on >50 strokes examining childhood/premorbid IQ, SES, and education. Two reviewers independently screened full texts and extracted and cross-checked data, including available risk factor adjustments. We meta-analyzed stroke risk using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and mean differences (MD). We tested effects of study and participant characteristics in sensitivity analyses and meta-regression, and assessed heterogeneity and publication bias.
3:::We identified 90 studies examining stroke risk and education (79), SES (10), or IQ (nine) including approximately 164,683 stroke and over 5 million stroke-free participants. Stroke risk increased with lower education (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.48), SES (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.12, 1.46), and IQ (HR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.00, 1.37) in studies reporting point estimates, with similar associations for MD. We found minimal publication bias. Between-study heterogeneity was partly explained by participant age and case ascertainment method.
4:::Almost half of our cohort was sarcopenic. Most of these patients are normal or overweight and would not be identified as malnourished by traditional measures. Sarcopenia was a predictor of surgery in patients with a body mass index ≥ 25. Identification of sarcopenia has implications for medical nutrition therapy as typically efforts are focused on underweight patients.
3:::Both ADT monotherapy and ADT plus tamsulosin significantly improved IPSS,QoL score, Q max and PVR at the end of the treatment period. ADT plus tamsulosin had a greater impact on total IPSS, IPSS obstructive subscore, QoL and PVR at week 8 and week 16 than ADT monotherapy. Tamsulosin group showed greater improvement in Q max than ADT group. Significant improvements of IPSS, IPSS obstructive subscore and QoL were achieved at early treatment stage (week 8) in group 2, whereas similar improvements were achieved at week 16 in group 1. There were no significant differences in IPSS, IPSS subscores, QoL and PVR between the two groups at week 24.
2:::In a prospective British occupational cohort, subject to 5 yearly clinical examinations, we examined ethnic differences in trajectories of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2 h post-load plasma glucose (2hPG), fasting serum insulin (FSI), 2 h post-load serum insulin (2hSI), HOMA of insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-S) and secretion (HOMA2-B), and the Gutt insulin sensitivity index (ISI0,120) among 120 South Asian and 867 white participants who developed diabetes during follow-up (1991-2013). We fitted cubic mixed-effects models to longitudinal data with adjustment for a wide range of covariates.
4:::HCV-RNA was successfully quantified with high reliability in liver bioptic samples and extrahepatic compartments, even when HCV-RNA was ""undetectable"" in serum. Abbott RealTime HCV-assay is a good diagnostic tool for HCV quantification in intra- and extra-hepatic compartments, whenever a bioptic sample is available.
3:::The leading mechanisms of injury were road traffic (26.1%), struck by objects (22.1%), cut/pierce (19.2%), falls (19.2%), and burns (5.4%). Injuries most commonly occurred in the home (36.7%) and on the road (33.2%). For those aged 19-44, the proportion of injuries due to assault was higher for females (35.9%) than males (29.7%). Males had increased odds for admission (aOR=1.48 95% CI=1.15-1.91) and for disability (aOR=1.45; 95% CI=1.06-1.99). Increased odds for admission were found for brain injuries, fractures, large system injuries, and musculoskeletal injuries when compared with soft tissue injuries. The highest odds for any level of discharge disability were found for brain injuries, fractures, injuries from falls, burns, and road traffic.
2:::We retrospectively reviewed a random sample of charts of children <15 years with acute TBI from 2006 to 2012. Cases were identified using International Classification of Disease 10 codes consistent with TBI. General linear models investigated changes in time to CT and other indicators before and after the shorter stays in ED target was introduced in 2009.
3:::A one-compartment linear model with first-order elimination was used to describe the data. Weight and postnatal age had a significant influence on vancomycin clearance. The typical population parameter estimates of clearance and distribution volume were 0.46 L/h and 4.45 L, respectively. Goodness-of-fit plots and bootstrap outcomes confirmed the relatively good stability and prediction capability of the model.
4:::TRP/Ccr was a hyperbolic function of EP/Ccr over a wide range of GFR. Like the Walton-Bijvoet nomogram, this function projected a near-constant TRP/Ccr - i.e., a TmP/GFR - at FEP > 20%. The nomogram depicts TmP/GFR accurately in CKD. .
