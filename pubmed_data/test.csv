1::Determine which posterior uveal melanoma (PUM) size classification with three categories has the best prognostic discrimination.
2::Single-institution study of 424 consecutive patients with PUM. The tumors largest basal diameter (LBD), smallest basal diameter (SBD), and thickness (TH) were estimated by fundus mapping and ultrasonography. Tumors were assigned to ""small,"" ""medium,"" or ""large"" size categories defined by 11 different classifications (Linear LBD, Rectangular LBD × TH, Cubic LBD × SBD × TH, Warren Original, Warren Modified, Augsburger, COMS Original, COMS Revised, TNM 2002, and modified TNM 2010 classification [a,b]). Prognostic significance of classifications was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier event curves with computation of log rank test for trend statistic.'
3::In six classification systems (Warren Original, Warren Modified, COMS Revised, TNM 2002, TNM 2010a, TNM 2010b) >50% of tumors fell within one subgroup. In the Warren Original classification <5% of tumors fell within one subgroup. Separation of Kaplan-Meier curves among three size categories was judged ""excellent"" in four classifications (Linear LBD, Cubic Volume, TNM 2010a, and TNM 2010b) and ""very poor"" in the Warren Original. Linear LBD classification was associated with highest log rank statistic value. TNM 2010a, TNM 2010b, TNM 2002, Augsburger, and Cubic Volume classifications were also determined to be quite good.
4::Linear LBD classification was the best three-size category discriminator among low-, intermediate-, and high-risk subgroups. Considering our findings, it seems possible that the arduous work required to apply complex classifications, especially for three-category systems, for PUM may not be justified in routine clinical practice.
3::Three mutations, including a new one, in MKRN3 were found in 2 familial cases (c.1229G>A; p.Cys410Ter and c.477_485del; p.Pro160Cysfs*14) (8.7%) and in 1 sporadic case (c.982C>T; p.Arg328Cys) (2.8%). We did not find rare variants in DLK1 and KCNK9 genes.
2::we studied 52 genetically-defined FD patients (32 with classical GLA mutations and 20 with late-onset variants or GLA polymorphisms), 15 patients with SFN associated with a specific cause and 22 healthy controls. Subjects underwent skin biopsy to evaluate Gb3 deposits and epi-dermal innervation.
4::1) Skin Gb3 deposits are specific to FD patients with classical GLA mutations; 2) Gb3 deposits were associated with lower skin innervation but they were not found inside axons, suggesting an indirect damage on peripheral small fibre innervation.
3::A total of 11 patients with acute Q fever hepatitis were selected and analyzed. Of the 11 patients, 3 (27%) had exposure to zoonotic risk factors and 7 (63%) met the serologic criteria. Granulomas with either circumferential or radiating fibrin deposition were observed in 10 cases on liver biopsy and in 1 case on bone marrow biopsy. 8 (73%) revealed positive Coxiella burnetii PCR from their formalin-fixed liver tissues. In contrast, none of 10 patients with alternative diagnosis who had hepatic granuloma revealed positive C. burnetii PCR from their formalin-fixed liver tissues.
2::Participants, recruited from seven centres in six leprosy endemic countries, were assessed using the ENLIST ENL Severity Scale by two researchers, one of whom categorised the severity of ENL. At a subsequent visit a further assessment using the scale was made and both participant and physician rated the change in ENL using the subjective categories of ""Much better"", ""somewhat better"", ""somewhat worse"" and ""much worse"" compared with ""No change"" or ""about the same"".
3::Out of 129 patients, 16S rRNA was detected in 65% of lesions at baseline. The M. ulcerans 16S rRNA remained positive in 78% of patients with unhealed lesions at 4 weeks, 52% at 8 weeks, 23% at 12 weeks and 10% at week 16. The median time to clearance of M. ulcerans 16S rRNA was 12 weeks. BU lesions with positive 16S rRNA after antibiotic treatment had significantly higher bacterial load at baseline, longer healing time and lower healing rate at week 4 compared with those in which 16S rRNA was not detected at baseline or had become undetectable by week 4.
4::This study indicates a significantly more intense DE-induced anticoagulation in diabetic rats that does not seem to be solely related to altered kidney function, and demonstrates that plasma cholesterol can significantly affect DE-anticoagulation in this setting. These results could explain the similar benefits of DE on stroke prevention in patients with and without DM, despite the significantly higher intrinsic thrombotic risk of the former, as well as the lack of benefit of reducing major bleeding in diabetics.
2::We conducted a randomized controlled trial in which CHB patients with spontaneous SAE were randomized to receive lamivudine (LVD) or entecavir (ETV) between July 2012 and April 2016 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01627223). The serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) viral loads on day 1 (baseline), 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 85, and 180 after initiating NA therapy were checked and analyzed.
3::A total of 89 bacterial isolates were studied which included Escherichia coli (n=43), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=18), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=10), Enterobacter cloacae (n=6), Acinetobacter baumannii (n=5), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=4), Proteus mirabilis (n=2) and Salmonella paratyphi (n=1). MIC testing showed that 58/89 (65 %) and 29/89 (32 %) isolates were resistant to meropenem and colistin, respectively, whereas 27/89 (30 %) isolates were resistant to both antibiotics. Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae isolates were blaNDM-1-positive (n=20). Some strains of Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae and K. oxytoca were blaOXA-181-positive (n=4). Class 1, 2 and 3 integrons were found in 24, 20 and 3 isolates, respectively. Nine NDM-1-positive Escherichia coli strains could transfer carbapenem resistance via plasmids to susceptible Escherichia coli AB1157. Meropenem and colistin showed synergy in 10/20 (50 %) isolates by 24 h time-kill studies.
1::To determine associations between physical activity (PA) and myopia in Danish school children and investigate the prevalence of myopia.
4::This model-based subgrouping of IBS partly supports the distinction of subgroups based on bowel habits, but additionally distinguishes subgroups with or without co-morbid extraintestinal somatic and psychological symptoms. The resulting groups show specific profiles of symptom combinations.
3::In simulation, spectral-spatial pulses yielded lower normalized root mean squared excitation error than spectral pulses. For both experiments, the spectral-spatial pulse images are also qualitatively better (more uniform, less signal loss) than the spectral pulse images.
2::The 2002 to 2013 National Inpatient Sample was queried for patients undergoing TSS for pituitary neoplasm. Patients with an additional diagnosis of OSA were identified, and compared to a non-OSA cohort.
3::Thirty-five cases were studied (92% males), with a mean (SD) age of 56.2 (9.3) years. Following treatment, majority of patients demonstrated stable disease (n = 15 [42%]), followed by partial response (29%), progressive disease (22%), and complete remission (6%). Significant improvement occurred in respiratory symptoms. Body fat declined while subscapular skinfold thickness and 6-min walk distance increased. Spirometric values and performance status remained unchanged. GPx levels declined significantly while no notable change was observed in MDA and TAS levels.
3::Baseline characteristics (n = 36) were: mean age 33 years, 35 (97%) without health insurance, 32 (89%) born in Mexico, and mean BMI 30 kg/m(2). Engagement was high among the 36 participants with 33 (92%) completing the intervention and follow-up measures. At follow-up, most participants thought the intervention was helpful (range: 85-100%) and acceptable (100% agreed I would recommend the program to others'). The mean dietary fat quality score improved by 0.5 units (95% CI: 0.0-1.1) and the mean fruit-vegetable servings/day improved by 0.7/day (95% CI: 0.1-1.3).'
4::Planner skills can be used to address barriers to planning for people with cognitive disability and complex support needs. Gaining skills took professional support and personal commitment.
2::We studied sensitivity of mechanical hyperalgesia induced by a single intrathecal (i.t.) injection of BDNF (3 ng/10 μL i.t.) administered at time zero, for: (1) chronic NMDA receptor inhibition with subcutaneously implanted 7-day delivery osmotic pumps loaded with ketamine; (2) TrkB receptor inhibition with intraperitoneal (i.p.) cyclotraxine-B; and (3) chronic glial inhibition with repeated propentofylline i.t. injections. Nociceptive threshold to paw pressure, tested on days -3, 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14, was used as the index of central sensitization. Locomotor patterns and food and water consumption were assessed with LABORAS.
3::Of the 60 143 paediatric ED presentations during the study period, 1551 allergy-related presentations were identified and reviewed. One hundred and eighty-seven met consensus criteria for anaphylaxis, and another 24 were diagnosed with anaphylaxis without meeting criteria. Of the 211 presentations, 105 cases were given an ED diagnosis of anaphylaxis and 106 cases were given an alternative diagnosis in ED. ED assessment had a sensitivity of 43.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 36.1-50.7%) and specificity of 97.9% (95% CI 96.9-98.7%) for anaphylaxis. Multiple logistic regression demonstrated that an ED anaphylaxis diagnosis was associated with previous anaphylaxis (odds ratio (OR) 3.20; 95% CI 1.52-6.75), arrival by ambulance (OR 2.80; 95% CI 1.36-5.74), a high-acuity triage category (OR 4.51; 95% CI 2.20-9.25) and presentation to a tertiary hospital (OR 2.86; 95% CI 1.44-5.67). ED diagnosis of anaphylaxis was less likely in those with resolution of symptoms and signs in at least one organ system prior to arrival (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.12-0.62).
2::All 580 consecutive patients aged ≥75 years (age 80 ± 4.9 years, 57.4% males) undergoing PCI between April 2006 and November 2011 were included. A total of 624 consecutive lesions were identified and analyzed. All V. Eld. patients (n = 253) were subsequently selected, and their outcomes compared to Eld. patients (n = 327). Mean follow-up was 30.8 ± 2.7 months with 98% clinical follow-up achieved.
3::Response rate was 100%. The majority of departments (84%) managed all EVT cases at their respective centres. Most departments have institutional guidelines on anaesthetic management (84%) including blood pressure management (63%) and were able to provide a 24-h immediate response to an EVT request (63%). Conscious sedation was favoured by 68% of the departments using a variety of sedation protocols. Propofol and remifentanil was preferred for GA (58%). Emergent conversion to GA due to uncontrolled patient movements or loss of airway was experienced by 82% and 35% of the departments, respectively. Majority of the departments (89%) responded that non-specialist anaesthetists occasionally handle EVT cases.
4::An address-based indicator can identify a large proportion of Medicaid enrollees who are experiencing homelessness. This approach may be of interest to researchers, states, and health systems attempting to identify homeless populations.
3:: The inner diameters of capillary vessels beneath the epithelium and in the middle of villi were 16.2 ± 3.0 µm and 14.5 ± 3.1 µm, respectively, in the pCLE images, but these were not consistent with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded histology. In tumors, larger capillary vessels were observed in aggressive malignant lymphoma and metastasis, and a ""soccer ball-like pattern"" constituting homogenous dark cells packed with polygonal, narrower capillary vessels was characteristic in pCLE images of a malignant lymphoma follicle. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and angiodysplasia contained anastomosis of capillary vessels of different calibers. In IgA vasculitis, segmental capillary strictures were observed. Intestinal lymphangiectasia with protein-losing enteropathy contained a reticular network of lymphatic vessels and dilated lymphatic ducts accompanied by numerous cell gaps. pCLE findings corresponded to pathologic diagnosis in 32 examinations (91 %).
2::This is a descriptive (cross-sectional) study; census method was used for sampling. Study population consists of 265 people, employed at units of family health and vaccination in Tabriz healthcare centers in 2015-2016. A questionnaire was used to collect the data. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS, version 23 through descriptive (mean and standard deviation) and analytical (Two Independent Samples T-test and analysis of variance) statistics.
4::The middle-aged had a relatively high percentage of interest (above 45%) in orthodontic treatment. However, demographic characteristics were not significantly associated with the positive interest. These results highlight the need for educating the middle-aged about the limitations and possibilities of orthodontic treatment to increase its acceptance.
3::Among 103 patients with type 2 diabetes, 75 (72.82%) were found to have Vitamin D deficiency. Amidst these patients, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (991.6 ± 161.82 vs. 899.29 ± 151.86, P < 0.001), right brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (1446.16 ± 204.33 vs. 1350.8 ± 178.39, P < 0.001), and left brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (1493.81 ± 219.65 vs. 1367.61 ± 220.64, P < 0.001) showed a significant reduction following Vitamin D supplementation. Further, these patients were found to have significant fall in serum malondialdehyde levels with rise in total antioxidant status ensuing Vitamin D supplementation.
3::We observed spermatogonial stem-like colonies in the G and 10% groups, but not the CTRL group. Immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and RT-PCR confirmed expressions of germ cell markers in these cells. In the spermatogonial stem-like cells, we observed a significant expression (P<0.05) of germ cell markers in the G and 10% groups versus the testis cells (T). Their proliferative and apoptotic activities were examined by Ki67 and PI/annexin V-FITC. Alkaline phosphatase assay showed that mouse spermato- gonial stem-like colonies were partially positive.
3::A total of 599 patients with IBD (387 with Crohns disease [CD] and 212 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) were enrolled. The majority of patients (81%) expressed feelings of fatigue, weakness, and being worn out in their daily lives during times of flare; this percentage was reduced to 61% during remission. Respondents were absent from work or school for an average period of 18 days because of illness, within the first 6 months; the majority of respondents (64%) felt stressed about their absence. Forty-six percent of the respondents reported having received unfair comments at work, or having suffered discrimination. Forty-seven percent of the respondents felt that IBD had negatively affected their income and earnings. Compared with patients with UC, those with CD reported a more frequent negative impact of IBD on work, or more economic burden. More than half of the respondents (61%) reported that IBD had prevented them from making or keeping friends.'
2::A team of seven informationists with broad systematic review experience examined existing systematic review standards, conducted a literature search, and used their own expertise to identify core competencies and skills that are necessary to undertake various roles in systematic review projects.
3::Increasing age improved recall rates (27.4% in 40s, 17.5% in 50's, 11.1% in 60's, and 8.6% in 70's), CDR (2.7, 3.2, 2.0, and 2.4), PPV (1.0, 1.8, 1.8, and 2.8%), sensitivity (81.3, 88.8, 90.3, and 94.7%), specificity (72.7, 82.7, 89.0, and 91.7%), and FPR (27.3, 17.3, 11.0, and 8.4%) (p < 0.05). Higher breast density impaired recall rates (4.0% in P1, 9.0% in P2, 28.9% in P3, and 27.8% in P4), PPV (3.3, 2.3, 1.2, and 1.3%), specificity (96.1, 91.2, 71.4, and 72.5%), and FPR (3.9, 8.9, 28.6, and 27.6%) (p < 0.001). It also increased CDR (1.3, 2.1, 3.3, and 3.6) and ICR (0.2, 0.3, 0.6, and 1.6) (p < 0.05). Successive visits to the same institution improved recall rates (20.9% for one visit, 10.7% for two visits, 7.7% for more than three visits), PPV (1.6, 2.8, and 2.7%), specificity (79.4, 89.6, and 92.5%), and FPR (20.6, 10.4, and 7.5%) (p < 0.001).'
4::The QRI identified key issues that enabled the integration of the trial into the clinical setting. This contributed to successful recruitment in the By-Band-Sleeve trial-currently the largest in bariatric practice-and offers opportunities to optimize recruitment in other trials in bariatrics.International Journal of Obesity accepted article preview online, 03 July 2017. doi:10.1038/ijo.2017.153.
3::The mean height of prolactinomas (23.2±11.3 mm) was similar to nonfunctioning adenomas (22.3±9.3 mm, p=0.8), and so were mean tumor volumes (prolactinoma=5.9±8 ml vs. nonfunctioning adenoma=4.8±5 ml, p=0.47). However, the mean suprasellar growth for prolactinomas was 2.9±5.3 mm and 7.3±4.7 mm for nonfunctioning adenomas (p<0.001), and the mean infrasellar growth was 10.2±8.0 and 5.0±6.6 mm, respectively (p=0.04). The inferior growth pattern of prolactinomas was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of having visual field abnormalities (11.4 vs. 57.1%, p<0.001).
2::PubMed and Embase databases were searched from inception to May 2016 for studies linking trial registries with bibliographic databases. The processes used to establish these links were categorised as automatic when the registration identifier was available in the bibliographic database or publication, or manual when linkage required inference or contacting of trial investigators. The number of links identified by each process was extracted where available. Linear regression was used to determine whether the proportions of links available via automatic processes had increased over time.
4::Outpatient visits during the 30 days after discharge were associated with a lower hospital readmission risk during the following 90 days. Assertive hospital discharge planning to secure outpatient visits after hospital discharge is needed for these patient populations.
3::There were 18 (14.2%) p16-positive, 45 (35.4%) p53-positive, 9 (7.1%) HPV DNA-positive, and 7 (5.5%) E6 and/or E7 mRNA-positive tumors, but the correlation of all pairs was poor. There was no demographic or histopathologic association with HPV status. Cause-specific survival was significantly better with p16-positive than with p16-negative tumors (p = .037).
2::Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from good crop silage were screened by growing them in MRS broth and a minimal medium with low carbohydrate content. Selected LAB (LAB 1821) were Gram-positive, rods, catalase negative, and were identified to be Lactobacillus plantarum based on their biochemical characteristics and a 16S rRNA analysis. Fresh rice straw was ensiled with two isolated LAB (1821 and 1841), two commercial inoculants (HM/F and P1132) and no additive as a control.
3::Most (88.4%) patients were on pharmacological treatment, with 53.8% of persons taking ≥3 medications. No significant changes in these percentages were observed over the study period. The use of tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines decreased, while the use of atypical antipsychotics increased. Axis I comorbidity was the main factor associated with pharmacological treatment and polypharmacy.
1::Due to the diversity within Europe, the implementation of pharmacogenomic testing in clinical practice faces specific challenges. In the context of the European pharmacogenomics implementation project ""Ubiquitous Pharmacogenomics"" (U-PGx; funded by the European Commission), we studied the current educational background.
4::Pain is very prevalent within PPN. Pain specialists should be aware of this. Detailed history-taking, full clinical examination, and requesting nerve conduction studies might lead to an earlier diagnosis of an underlying malignancy.
2::We isolated a high-affinity CD13-specific single-chain fragment variable (scFv13) from a phage display library of V-genes from mice immunized with soluble antigen. An immunotoxin comprising the scFv13 and a truncated version of the exotoxin A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ETA, scFv13-ETA') and a bispecific scFv targeting CD13 and CD16 simultaneously (bsscFv[13xds16]) was generated and investigated for their therapeutic potential.'
3::MMP-2 and -9 expression were suppressed significantly by treatment with SB-3CT. The data demonstrated, for the first time, that SB-3CT strongly reduced corneal lymphangiogenesis and macrophage infiltration during inflammation. Furthermore, expressions of VEGF-C and its receptor VEGFR-3 were significantly inhibited by SB-3CT during corneal lymphangiogenesis.
4::RTI accounted for the majority of trauma admissions to our PICU. RTI, female gender and age less than 4 years were all associated with an increased risk for mortality in our study.
3::Elevated AFP levels were found in 5 patients (1.97%, 95% CI 0.19-3.68) and in 4 controls (2.04%, 95% CI 0.06-4.02). The elevations were modest and kept elevated throughout the clinical course. No hepatic disorders were recorded. Histologically, pure seminoma was confirmed.
2::This observational study was conducted in 3 tertiary hospitals. The minimal distance between the PSC and the posterior cranial fossa (PSC thickness) was estimated by thin-section multidetector row computed axial tomography (CAT) scan of the temporal bones. Nonselected consecutive patients of all ages (607 temporal bones) were considered.
3::Immune-cell therapy increased median survival time (21.5 months) in patients with advanced GC. The patients who underwent surgery with or without chemotherapy as a prior treatment showed better prognosis than those who received other therapies (p<0.001). Patients who showed stable disease or a partial response to immune-cell therapy had a better prognosis than those with progressive disease (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that performance status, the type of immune-cell therapy, and prior treatment were independent prognostic factors for patients with GC. No serious adverse event was reported in immune-cell therapy.
3::During second-line treatment, a total of 59 patients received 520 chemotherapy applications. As the main higher-grade symptom of toxicity, diarrhea (NCI-CTC-toxicity grade 3) presented in 8 patients (13.6%, 95%CI=5.1-23.7), followed by leukocytopenia (CTC grade 3) in 3 patients (5.1%, 95%CI=0-11.9), followed by thrombocytopenia (CTC grade 3) in 1 patient (1.7%, 95%CI=0-5.1). Fifty-nine patients were evaluable for treatment response. The remission data can be summarized as follows: complete remission (CR); n=0; partial remission (PR); n=6 (10%; 95%CI=3.4-18.6); stable disease (SD); n=31 (53%; 95%CI=39.0-64.4); progressive disease (PD); n=19 (33%; 95%CI=20.3-44.1). The median progression-free survival (PFS) rate (n=59) was 4.2 months (range=3.8-5.8 months). The median survival time counted from the start of second-line treatment (n=59) 14.2 months (range 8.2-17.3 months) and the median survival time counted from the start of first-line therapy (n=59) 25 months (range 19-27 months).
3::Flow cytometry revealed significant binding of aptamer and conjugate in the MCF-7 and WERI-Rb1 cell lines. Briefly, 62% in MCF and 30% in WERI-Rb1 cells with conjugate treated cells (p<0.005). The cell-cycle analysis indicated G2 phase arrest in MCF-7 cells and S phase arrest in WERI-Rb1 cells (p<0.005). Microarray analysis showed differentially expressed genes involved in cell cycle, DNA damage, and apoptosis. The BrDU assay and the apoptosis assay showed that the expression of BrDU was reduced in conjugate-treated cells and the PARP levels were increased confirming the double stranded DNA breaks (p<0.005). In MCF-7 and WERI-Rb1 cells, most of the cells underwent necrosis (p<0.005).
3::Overall higher levels of ALK7 transcripts were seen in the breast cancer samples vs. normal tissue. However, within the cancer cohort, lower levels of ALK7 transcript were associated with poor prognosis. Patients with lower expression of ALK7 also had shorter survival. Overexpression of ALK7 reduced proliferation and adhesion of breast cancer cells in vitro. We found that overexpressed ALK7 had complex effects on the MCF-7 cell sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs.
2::A quantitative-qualitative study of 96 men and 54 women with SpA was conducted at the Alicante University General Hospital, in a Spanish Mediterranean city, from March 2013 to February 2014. Descriptive and qualitative content analyses compared working lives and family/partner relationships of male and female patients.
3::All patients presented with prominent cerebellar signs, which were often associated with memory loss and/or oculomotor, visual or peripheral/spinal cord signs. In contrast, dementia was invariably a late finding. All CSF samples were positive for the 14-3-3 protein assay and had total-tau protein levels above 1250 pg/mL. Brain DW-MRI showed hyperintensity of basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebral cortex, respectively in 91.5%, 57.4% and 19.1% of cases. EEG revealed periodic sharp-wave complexes in only 17.8% of cases.
4::sCJDVV2 should be considered in any patient presenting with a rapidly progressive ataxia, especially when associated with oculomotor, visual or peripheral/spinal cord signs, even in the absence of dementia or myoclonus. CSF assays and brain DW-MRI represent sensitive diagnostic tests, even at an early stage. These data strongly suggest that sCJDVV2 can be clinically diagnosed early and accurately based on clinical data, DW-MRI, CSF assays and codon 129 genotyping and provide the basis for improved and subtype-specific diagnostic criteria of sCJD.
1::To estimate the diagnostic value of multi-slice spiral CT angiography (CTA) in lower gastrointestinal bleeding by a meta-analysis.
3::25 patients (mean age 10.8±4.5 years, range 4 months to 16 years) were included. MRE was diagnostic in 76% (19 of 25). The most frequent diagnoses were intestinal polyp (28%) and Meckels diverticulum (16%). Sensitivity and specificity of MRE were 86% and 100% respectively. There were no reported complications during any of the examinations.'
4::This study indicates that Volpara™ Density Maps is reliable in estimating the local glandular tissue distribution and can be used for its assessment and follow-up. Volpara™ Density Maps is robust to small variations of the acquisition angle and to the beam energy, although divergences arise due to different breast compression conditions.
2::CTA datasets of 26 patients were analyzed retrospectively with the proposed methodology, which consists of a knowledge-based segmentation of the aortic root and detection of the orientation and size of the aortic annulus. The accuracy of the methodology was determined by comparing the automatically derived results with the reference standard obtained by semi-automatic delineation of the aortic root and manual definition of the annulus plane.
3::The frequencies of A muciniphila, C leptum, and F prausnitzii in healthy controls stool samples were significantly more than those of patients with CU (P < .001, P < .01, and P < .05, respectively), whereas the Enterobacteriaceae family was detected in all patients and healthy controls' stool samples. The relative amounts of A muciniphila in healthy control positive samples were significantly higher than those of samples from patients with CU (P < .001). Furthermore, there was a corresponding increase of relative amounts of C leptum and F prausnitzii in healthy control positive samples compared with those of patients with CU (P = .09 and P = .08, respectively). The mean of the relative amounts of Enterobacteriaceae family in the stool samples from patients with CU was more than that of healthy controls; however, the difference was nearly significant (P = .12).'
2::We treated primary cultures of murine brain microvessel endothelial cells (BMEC), astrocytes, and microglia with PBS or IL-1β, and then performed qPCR to measure inflammatory gene expression or immunocytochemistry to evaluate nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation. To evaluate whether astrocytes and/or BMEC propagate inflammatory signals to microglia, we exposed microglia to astrocyte-conditioned media and co-cultured endothelial cells and glia in transwells. Treatment groups were compared by Students t tests or by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni-corrected t tests.'
3::The difference in mortality rate between total CVD and cancer narrowed over the study period as age-standardized mortality from CVD decreased more steeply than cancer in both sexes. We observed higher overall rates for both diseases in men compared to women, with high mortality rates from ischemic heart disease and lung cancer in men. Joinpoint regression analysis indicated that trends of decreasing rates of CVD have increased over time while decreasing trends in cancer mortality rates have slowed down since the 1990s. The lowest improvements in mortality rates were for cancer in those over 75 years of age and lung cancer in women.
4::Among people seeking help to stop smoking from their general practice, one-off brief advice from a general practitioner appears to be as effective as several sessions of behavioural support from a practice nurse when smoking cessation medication is provided.
2::A total of 2223 consecutive patients undergoing PCI from the radial approach were analyzed. Radial access failure mode and requirement for crossover to femoral access during a 12-month run-in period were compared with the following 14-month period with routine BAT usage.
3::Ethanol reduced LV function (dP/dtmax and LVDP) and BP, and increased cardiac NADPH oxidase activity, ROS and MDA levels, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Either inhibitor partially, and their combination significantly, attenuated these responses despite the substantially higher blood ethanol level, and the increased cardiac oxidative stress and reduced BP caused by 3-AT alone or with 4-MP. The inhibitors reduced cardiac MDA level and reversed ethanol effect on cardiac and plasma MDA.
4::We present strong evidence for construct validity and interrater reliability of ARCS. Our study shows that learning curves for some console skills plateau faster than others. Therefore, ARCS may be more useful than GEARS to evaluate distinct console skills. Future studies will examine why some domains did not adequately differentiate between subjects and applications for intraoperative use.
3::A 10 μg/m(3) increase in PM10 concentration was associated with 1.95% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02%, 3.91%) increase in respiratory emergency room visits. No significant interaction with desert dust episodes was observed. Compared with non-dust days, there was a 47% (95% CI: 29%, 68%) increase in visits in dust days not adjusting for PM10. Desert dust days were associated with higher numbers of emergency room visits for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory infections with increases of 38%, 57% and 60%, respectively (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Analyses of respiratory hospital admissions provided similar results. PM10 effects decreased when adjusting for desert dust days and were further confounded by co-pollutants.
2::This is a retrospective clinical research study. Forty-five patients underwent operative hysteroscopy to remove the residual gestational tissue in the caesarean scar after failed D&C treatment. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of hysteroscopic surgeries of 45 CSP cases were investigated. All data analyses were conducted with SPSS 17.0.
3::Of the 703 890 CDC-funded HIV testing events conducted in nonhealthcare facilities in 2015, 6848 (0.9%) were provided to adolescent MSM aged 13-19 years. Among those tested, 1.8% were newly diagnosed with HIV, compared with 0.7% among total tests provided in nonhealthcare facilities regardless of age and sex. The odds of testing positive among black adolescent MSM were nearly four times that of white adolescent MSM in multivariable analysis (odds ratio = 3.97, P < 0.001). Among adolescent MSM newly diagnosed with HIV, 67% were linked to HIV medical care. Linkage was lower among black (59%) and Hispanic/Latino adolescent MSM (71%) compared with white adolescent MSM (88%).
2::Using a door-to-door approach that includes systematically revisiting households, all adolescents enumerated were offered participation in the intervention and verbal consent was obtained. Data were analysed from October 2015 to September 2016.
3::The deep infection rate for standard operating theatres was 0 of 684 (0%); for temporary theatres it was eight of 539 (1.5%) (p = 0.001).
4::In patients with newly diagnosed AF, cardiology care was associated with improved outcomes, potentially mediated by early prescription of oral anticoagulation therapy. Although hypothesis-generating, these data warrant serious consideration and study of health care system interventions at the time of new AF diagnosis.
3::Initial data found that students were satisfied or strongly satisfied with their collaborative nursing education (M ± SD = 183.9 ± 32.7). However, any type of conflict had a significant negative relationship with satisfaction in all domains. No other significant predictors of satisfaction were uncovered.
2::Thirty-six female Wistar rats weighing 150-200 g were randomly divided into six groups of six rats each. Thirty rats were induced for type 1 DM (DM1) with a single intraperitoneal administration of 65 mg/kg body weight of streptozotocin. Group 1 was normal control and was administered distilled water while Group 2 served as DM1 control group; Groups 3, 4, 5 and 6 were diabetic rats treated with 208 mg/kg OG (DM1 + OG), 52 mg/kg VA (DM1 + VA), 208 mg/kg OG + 52 mg/kg VA (DM1 + OG + VA) and 0.16 IU insulin (DM1 + insulin) respectively. Determination of methemoglobin and sulfhemoglobin was achieved by the absorption spectrum principle. Red blood cell (RBC) catalase was assayed by continuous spectrophotometric method.
3::Data analysis revealed that perceived competency in palliative and EOL care is significantly higher in the ICU nurses (p <.0001). Mean scores were significantly higher when nurses had more than 10 years of experience (p <.0001). Open-ended responses indicated concerns regarding improved communication behaviors, decision making, and facilitation of continuity of care.
4::A lower retinal thickness at the parafovea and a higher BMI can predict 4-year incident neuropathy in patients with diabetes, with acceptable diagnostic accuracies. This OCT-derived measure may serve as a potential ophthalmic marker in the screening of patients at risk of developing DPN.
3::Ephedrine administration was significantly associated with decreased risk of intraoperative flap complications (OR, 0.88), including vasospasm, thrombosis, and congestion requiring revision, compared with controls, after controlling for the severity and duration of hypotension. Phenylephrine had no significant association with complication rates. Vasopressor administration was not associated with an increased risk of reoperation in the setting of necrosis within 60 days.
2::The authors institutional database was queried for nonsyndromic craniosynostosis from 2000 to 2014. Patients with an identified syndrome were excluded. Specific data elements included age, gender, velopharyngeal adequacy by means of the Pittsburgh Weighted Speech Scale, evaluation for anatomical motor delay, language acquisition delay/disorder, articulation or speech sound production delays/disorders, and whether speech therapy was recommended. Diagnosis of a submucous cleft palate was noted.'
1::This case report presents an interdisciplinary approach in school-based therapy, combining physical therapy and applied behavior analysis to improve the motor skills and the participation in recreational activities of a child with autism spectrum disorder.
3::The crude method showed a significant higher reduction in HIV-1 RNA reduction in patients receiving raltegravir plus etravirine compared with patients receiving raltegravir (mean reduction of 2.1 versus 1.8 log10 copies/mL). However, survival methods adjusted for both censoring, due to the limit of quantification, and confounding factors lead to a nonsignificant difference between the 2 treatment groups (mean reduction of 2.8 versus 2.7 log10 copies/mL).
2::Using data from the Karonga Health and Demographic Surveillance Site in Malawi from 2005 to 2014, we used total and age-specific fertility rates and Cox regression to assess associations between HIV and ART use and fertility. We also assessed temporal trends in in utero and breastfeeding HIV and ART exposure among live births.
4::Our findings indicate that underreporting of concussion among those players interviewed appears to be prevalent and associated with misconceptions about injury risk, and a culture that both reinforces and encourages underreporting with tacit or overt complicity of parents and coaches. Our findings support the need to alter the culture of violence and tough play in hockey by education, rule changes, economic measures, and changes in governance of the sport. Interviewing more stakeholders and policy makers would shed light on such potential interventions.
3::Both patients remain in an overall good condition 27 and 5 months respectively following treatment for HEHE.
3::The results showed that there is no significant association of the RCC risk with the MMP-7 A-181G genotype, even after adjusted for the possible confounding factors. The MMP-7 C-153T polymorphism was not identified among the subjects investigated.
2::The mandibular second premolars of 7 beagle dogs were extracted, and on a randomly selected side, a full-thickness mucoperiosteal buccal flap extending from the distal aspect of the third premolar to the mesial aspect of the first premolar was elevated. The other side did not receive flap surgery. The mandibular third premolars were protracted with orthodontic appliances. Tooth movements were analyzed biweekly over an 8-week period with calipers and radiographs. The amount and density of bone were analyzed using microcomputed tomography; bone remodeling was evaluated with histologic sections.
3::Of 4269 records, 80 full texts were obtained, with 24 studies meeting the selection criteria. Of these, 11 were included in the quantitative synthesis. A weighted estimate of objectively assessed compliance levels in relation to stipulated wear time was calculated with the discrepancy highest in the headgear group (5.81 hours per day, 95% confidence interval, 4.98, 6.64) based on 6 studies. The mean discrepancy between self-reported and objectively assessed headgear wear was 5.02 hours per day (95% confidence interval, 3.64, 6.40). Compliance level was not directly related to appliance type (P = 0.211). Thematic synthesis was not undertaken because of the limited number of qualitative studies.
4::Compliance with removable orthodontic appliances and adjuncts is suboptimal, and patients routinely overestimate duration of wear. Techniques for improving compliance have promise but require further evaluation in high-level research.
3::Ten studies were included in this systematic review. The main outcomes that were measured were pain, disability, neurophysiology pain test, attitudes and beliefs, fear-avoidance beliefs, self-care, kinesiophobia, quality of life and algometry. The results suggest that pain neuroscience education is effective in the short term and medium/long term for pain relief, either alone or combined with multimodal treatment. It was also effective in normalizing cognitions about pain, fear-avoidance beliefs, and self-care.
2::Using a nationwide, US administrative claims database, a retrospective matched-cohort of newly diagnosed NVAF patients (age≥18 years) treated with dabigatran or warfarin (propensity score matched 1:1) in 01/01/2011-12/31/2013 was evaluated. All-cause, stroke-, and bleed-specific per patient per month (PPPM) healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), incidence rate of hospitalization for stroke or bleed, 30-day readmission, and persistence were reported.
4::Self-reported unsteadiness is independently associated with an increased risk of FOF, fear-related activity restriction, recurrent falls, and disability at follow-up. Self-reported balance/steadiness should be included in routine assessment of older adults especially those at risk of falls. As unsteadiness is modifiable, older adults should be targeted for balance-related training or medication review to minimize future risk of these outcomes.
3::Patients with PAD had significantly reduced peak torque and area under the curve compared with controls. Measures of control differed between PAD conditions only. Load rate and linear region duration were greater in the pain condition. Time to peak torque was shorter in the pain condition.
2::A retrospective review identified patients 18 years and older who presented to a single fellowship-trained hand surgeon with a symptomatic trigger digit during a 1-year period. Baseline demographic data were recorded. Patients with persistent trigger digit after a single injection were offered a second injection. Patients refusing a second injection were excluded from our analysis. Patients with persistent symptoms after 2 injections were offered surgery. For patients with diabetes mellitus, additional information regarding method of disease control and hemoglobin A1c level was recorded.
3::The overall success of corticosteroid injection was 84% with 16% of patients requiring surgical release. Of the 240 patients successfully treated with injection, 99 (41%) required a second injection. Injections resulted in persistent triggering in 15% of patients with diabetes and 17% of patients without diabetes. A multivariate regression analysis revealed that the 2 strongest risk factors for requiring surgical release were patient age and patients whose fourth digit of the right hand was injected. Diabetes was not a risk factor for persistent triggering after corticosteroid injection.
4::Clinically significant endoscopy findings were common in both controls and gastroparetics. As more than one-third of patients had findings on endoscopy, we conclude that upper endoscopy remains an important part of the evaluation process of patients with dyspeptic symptoms and suspected gastroparesis. As gross abnormalities were frequently not present with histologic changes, routine biopsy is required. There was no association between studied symptoms and the presence of gastroparesis. A comprehensive evaluation of children with dyspeptic symptoms requires endoscopy with biopsy and solid-phase gastric emptying scan to determine the underlying diagnosis.
2::A series of 13 patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation for suspected autonomic impairment, including a neurological examination, autonomic testing, and laboratory studies. A diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome was established as the cause of autonomic dysfunction in all. Clinical features, findings on autonomic testing, and laboratory results are described.
3::All patients in this series reported postural lightheadedness and syncope or near-syncope. Autonomic testing confirmed the presence of orthostatic hypotension on tilt-table testing in 5 patients and an excessive postural tachycardia and/or hypertensive response in 8 patients. Only 2 of the patients with orthostatic hypotension had a significant sensory neuropathy. Symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal and genitourinary impairment were seen in nearly all patients, with abnormal motility testing (most frequently esophageal dysmotility) in 5 of 6 patients who underwent formal testing. Patients in this series treated with immune-modulating therapy experienced significant improvement.
3::A total of 491 patients (mean age 47 years) participated; 82% were below retirement age, and of these 56% were employed. Employment was related to disease severity, and MS affected productivity at work for 90% of patients. Overall, 95% and 67% of patients experienced fatigue and cognition as a problem, respectively. The mean utility and annual costs were 0.735 and €22,600 at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-3, 0.500 and €38,100 at EDSS 4-6.5, and 0.337 and €48,100 at EDSS 7-9, respectively. The average cost of a relapse was estimated at €2300.
4::Our results indicated that fosA3 could spread through plasmids in S. flexneri isolates, along with the bla(CTX-M) and bla(TEM), which facilitate its quick dispersal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of CTX-M-123-type ESBLs in S. flexneri isolates from patients in China.
3::The study period was from 2001 to 2015. Patients (24,652) were included in the study. Of the patients, 93.7% (n = 23,091) were women and 6.3% (n = 1564) were men. Eighteen percent (4636) were dispensed only one prescription. Of the patients, 44.2% included in the study had medication possession ratio (MPR) ≥80% over follow-up period; 8922 (36.2%) who were prescribed from 2001 to 2015 persisted for 1 year with MPR ≥80% and 19.8% persisted for 3 years. Forty percent of expenditure on osteoporosis medication was made for treatment courses with insufficient adherence.
2::A total of 15 patients reported for tooth extraction were enrolled in this study. Implants were placed in average 5.2 ± 2 months after socket grafting. At this visit, Cone Beam CT (CBCT) images and core biopsies were taken. Implant stability (ISQ) was assessed at the insertion as well as at the day of final restoration.
3::During 36 flights, 1260 healthy subjects [626 women (F) and 634 men (M) (mean age = 43, SD = 16)] were assessed. Additionally, 72 subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (F = 32, M = 40, mean age = 48, SD = 17) and 74 with heart failure (F = 50, M = 24, mean age = 54, SD = 14) contributed to 11 flights. Additionally, 76 normal controls were observed while engaged in a usual days work (F = 38, M = 38, mean age = 39, SD = 15). There were no health-significant changes in D-Dimer, interleukin-6, or FEV1. Spo2 varied as expected, with lowest values at 8000 ft and in patients with cardiopulmonary disease. The only differences from the controls were the loss of the normal diurnal variations in interleukin-6 and D-Dimer.'
2::A study was performed in a hypobaric chamber to characterize deterioration of cognitive performance under moderate (MH) and severe (SH) hypoxia conditions, culminating in subjects inability to perform tasks. Subjects operated a synthetic workstation, performing multiple simultaneous tasks during hypobaric exposures equivalent to 5486 m (18,000 ft) MH and 7620 m (25,000 ft) SH ascents. Performance was compared across baseline, altitude exposure, and recovery periods within MH vs. SH altitude profiles. Ascents lasted until at least one of a list of termination criteria was met, at which point the chamber was returned to ground level pressure and the subject resumed workstation performance during recovery.'
4::Similar to findings from high-income settings, cardiology administrators and cardiologists in South America value CR as part of cardiac patient care, but funding and availability of programs restrict capacity to deliver these services.
3::Sixty-three lesions were identified in 58 patients; 40 of the 63 (63.5%) were benign. Patients with malignant lesions had elevated serum tumor marker levels more often than patients who had benign lesions (26.1% versus 5.7%, p = 0.043). The clinical palpability of lesions and history of testicular cancer were not statistically significantly different between patients with malignant and those with benign lesions. Poorly defined margins of a lesion and focal calcification within the lesion were more often found in malignant lesions. Maximal size of a lesion and peripheral vascularity were not associated with either the benign or the malignant nature of a lesion.
2::Between 1995 and 2014, 94 mobile spine GCT patients were treated at our hospital, comprising 43 male and 51 female patients with an average age of 33.4 years. Piecemeal intralesional spondylectomy and total en bloc spondylectomy (TES) were performed. Radiotherapy was suggested for recurrent or residual GCT cases. Since denosumab was not available before 2014 in our country, only interferon and/or zoledronic acid was suggested.
4::In combination with DST, application of the GenoType MTBDRplus and MTBDRsl assays may be a useful supplementary tool to allow a rapid and safe diagnosis of multidrug resistance and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.
3::Renal lymphangiectasia was diagnosed on CT IVP. In each case, where aspiration of collection fluid was offered, the laboratory diagnosis of renal lymphangiectasia was confirmed and patients were managed conservatively. However, large collection in one patient was relieved by percutaneous aspiration.
2::In 15 patients with severe horizontal alveolar ridge resorption, lateral augmentation procedures were performed using CCXBB as bone replacement grafts. Twenty-six weeks postoperatively, a re-entry procedure was performed to evaluate the bone width for adequate implant placement and two histological specimens were retrieved from each patient, one being processed for ground sectioning and the other for decalcified paraffin-included sections. In non-decalcified sections, the relative proportions occupied by bone, biomaterials, and connective tissue present in the biopsies were identified. In de-calcified sections, structures and cells positive for osteopontin (OPN), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity (TRAP), osteocalcin (OSC), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were assessed.
3::Soft tissue dehiscence occurred during the follow-up in 5 out of 15 patients (33.3%). The mean crest width at baseline was 2.78 mm (SD 0.57) and the mean crest width at re-entry was 6.90 mm (SD 1.22), with a mean ridge width increase of 4.12 mm (SD 1.32). Twenty-six bone biopsies were obtained from 13 patients. Histomorphometric analysis showed a mean of 26.90% (SD 12.21) of mineralized vital bone (MVB), 21.37% (SD 7.36) of residual CCXBB, 47.13% (SD 19.15) of non-mineralized tissue, and 0.92% of DBBM. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed a large number of OPN-positive cells 8.12% (SD 4.73), a lower proportion of TRAP positive multinuclear cells 5.09% (SD 4.91), OSC-positive cells 4.09% (SD 4.34), and a limited amount of ALP positive cells 1.63% (SD 2).
3::The sample included 1,202 eyes (958 eyes with normal health and 244 eyes with early AMD). In normal eyes, SDDs were not associated with any visual function evaluated. In eyes with early AMD, dark adaptation was markedly delayed in eyes with SDDs versus no SDD (a 4-minute delay on average), P = 0.0213. However, this association diminished after age adjustment, P = 0.2645. Other visual functions in early AMD eyes were not associated with SDDs.
4::This randomized clinical trial found that TXA administration safely reduced blood loss with a tendency for decreased transfusion rate and total blood product consumption for patients undergoing hip arthroplasty for acute FNF. More studies are needed to further ascertain the role of TXA in the management of patients with FNF.
2::Eight Yorkshire-cross swine were splenectomized, instrumented, and subjected to rapid 25% total blood volume hemorrhage. After 30 minutes of shock, animals received 60 minutes of Zone 1 REBOA with a low-profile REBOA catheter. During subsequent resuscitation with shed blood, the aortic occlusion balloon was gradually deflated in stepwise fashion at the rate of 0.5 mL every 30 seconds until completely deflated. Aortic flow rate and proximal mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured continuously over the period of balloon deflation.
3::Five hundred forty-three patients with NCTH underwent ENDO (n = 166, 31%), OPEN (n = 309, 57%), or RT (n = 68, 12%). Anatomic bleeding locations were 25% chest, 41% abdomen, and 31% pelvis. ENDO was used to treat relatively few types of vascular injuries, whereas OPEN and RT injuries were more diverse. ENDO patients had more blunt trauma (95% vs. 34% vs. 32%); severe injuries (median Injury Severity Score, 34 vs. 27 vs. 21), and increased time to intervention (median, 298 vs. 92 vs. 51 minutes) compared with OPEN and RT. Mortality was 15% versus 20% versus 79%. ENDO was associated with decreased mortality compared to OPEN (relative risk, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.73).
4::Anchor sleeves with 6.5-mm-diameter pedicle screws provided markedly higher resistance to screw pullout than 7.5-mm-diameter revision screws and fixation statistically equivalent to 8.5-mm-diameter screws, possibly because of medial-lateral expansion within the vertebral space and/or convex filling of the pedicle. AS results had the lowest SD, indicating minimal variability in bone-screw purchase.
3::With the less-invasive approach, anterior lumbar interbody fusion was accomplished in all sheep, and no surgical complications were observed. In the clinical study, operation time, blood loss, and duration of hospitalization were comparable between 2 groups. Using the less-invasive approach decreased the length of incision, 3-day postoperative visual analogue scale score, postoperative independent standing, and narcotic-dependent duration. No surgical complications were observed in either group.
2::Using mixed-effects latent growth curve modeling with time since diagnosis as a fixed effect, age-adjusted standardized measures of working memory, processing speed, executive function, and attention were obtained and repeated about one and two years later. A subsample was tested for academic achievement at the end of treatment. .
4::Subclinical carotid atherosclerosis was associated with worse cognition among those at higher risk for Alzheimer disease. Interventions targeting early stages of atherosclerosis may modify cognitive aging.
3::There were no statistically significant group differences in any of the measures of daily physical activity (P > 0.290) or between days of follow-up (P > 0.155). Overall, the median participant had 3.50 hours (interquartile range, 2.85-4.81 hours) of upright time, and participants showed wide variation in all outcomes of daily physical activity.
2::We enrolled English speaking patients, aged ≥ 65 years, who presented to the ED of an urban level one trauma center with a fall or fall related injury and discharged home. During subjects initial visits to the ED, we screened and enrolled patients, gathered patient demographics and provided them with a flyer for a Matter of Balance course. Sixty-days post enrollment, we conducted a phone follow-up interview to collect information on post-fall behaviors including information regarding the efforts to engage family and the primary care provider, enroll in a falls prevention program, assess patients' attitudes towards falling and experiences with any subsequent falls.'
4::Perioperative administration of 5% dextrose in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery can reduce PONV significantly and even if PONV occurs, the quantity of rescue antiemetics to combat PONV is also reduced significantly.
3::From 2005-2014, 18,935 (26.3%) eligible patients had CRT in place, implanted, or prescribed. The majority were male (60.0%) and white (61.9%). CRT utilization increased during the study period (P = .0002) especially in the early period. Women were less likely to receive CRT, and this difference increased over time (interaction P = .0037) despite greater mortality risk reduction (interaction P = .0043). Black patients were less likely than white patients to have CRT throughout the study period (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.79; 95% CI 0.74-0.85). Patients with CRT implanted during the index hospitalization had lower mortality (adjusted HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.59-0.71) and were less likely to be readmitted for HF than patients without CRT (adjusted HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.58-0.71).
2::Six recent ICU ventilators were evaluated. Technical performances were assessed under two FIO2 levels (100%, 50%), three respiratory mechanics combinations (Normal: compliance [C] = 70 mL cmH2O(-1)/resistance [R] = 5 cmH2O L(-1) s(-1); Restrictive: C = 30/R = 10; Obstructive: C = 120/R = 20), four exponential levels of leaks (from 0 to 12.5 L min(-1)) and three levels of inspiratory effort (P0.1 = 2, 4 and 8 cmH2O), using an automated test lung. Ergonomics were evaluated by 20 ICU physicians using a global and comprehensive model involving physiological response to stress measurements (heart rate, respiratory rate, tidal volume variability and eye tracking), psycho-cognitive scales (SUS and NASA-TLX) and objective tasks completion.
4::Despite similar technical performance, some ICU ventilators exhibit low ergonomics performance and a high risk of misusage.
3::This population mean aged 47.63 years included 52.2% females and 58.2% non-smokers. Following DNA separation and genotyping, 65.7% of patients were homozygous carriers of the IL-6 - 572G; 49.3% were carriers of the IL-10 -592A- allele (AA and CA genotypes); and 35.8% carried SCP genotypes for both polymorphisms. The clinical parameters after therapy were not associated with the genotype status. The multiple logistic regression analysis did not show any statistically significant association between the genotypes and the variables tested.
1::To investigate the predictive role of Intravoxel Incoherent Motion Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (IVIM-DWI) parameters on cervical nodal response to chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
3::The annual increase in both patellar and trochlear cartilage thickness was 0.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6, 1.0) and 0.6% (0.3, 0.9), for adolescent males and females respectively; the longitudinal gain in patellar and trochlear tAB was 1.3% (1.1, 1.5) and 0.5% (0.2, 0.8), and 1.6% (1.1, 2.2) and 0.8% (0.3, 0.7) for adolescent males and females, respectively (no significant between-sex differences). Mature athletes showed smaller gains in tAB, and loss of <1% of cartilage thickness annually. While no significant sex-differences existed in adolescent patellar T2 changes, mature males gained significantly greater T2 than mature females (p=0.002-0.013).
4::Patellar and trochlear cartilage thickness and tAB were observed to increase in young athletes in late adolescence, without significant differences between sexes. Mature athletes displayed patellar cartilage loss (and T2 increases in mature males), potentially reflecting degenerative changes.
2::The case group comprised 470 patients with PVVs, and the control group included 269 individuals without a history of chronic venous disease. All cases and controls were ethnic Russians. Genotypes were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction allelic discrimination. Association was studied by logistic regression analysis.
3::RFA was performed with the double puncture technique on, collectively, 10 great saphenous veins, 5 small saphenous veins, and 5 anterior accessory saphenous veins. Mean preoperative Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology score was 4.38 ± 1.6. Three limbs required prepuncture because of difficulty in advancing the catheter cephalad through tortuosity and focal obstruction after failure with techniques such as a guidewire, a guide catheter, and manual compression with ultrasound guidance. Ten limbs received planned double prepuncture for multiple adjacent incompetent veins, for which venipuncture and cannulation of the second target vein would be difficult after tumescent application to the first vein. Postoperative ultrasound demonstrated successful closure of all target veins in which the double prepuncture technique was used. One patient had a deep venous thrombosis (7.7%) that resolved without complications.
4::Iliac vein stents placed for nonthrombotic iliac vein compression had statistically higher patency than those placed for venous thrombosis, with few stent failures, all occurring within 6 months. Iliac vein stents placed for venous thrombosis continued with stent failure after 6 months and may benefit from extended surveillance.
2::This analysis used Pan American Health Organizations TRIVAC model (version 2.0) to examine nationwide introduction of two-dose rotavirus vaccination in 2017, compared to no vaccination. Three mortality scenarios (low, high, and midpoint) were assessed. Benefits and costs were examined from the societal perspective over ten successive birth cohorts with a 3% discount rate. Model inputs were locally acquired and complemented by internationally validated estimates.'
3::Membership in AM and IMAST increased from 820 in 2003 to 1,323 in 2016. Attendance at the AM has increased, whereas attendance at IMAST has declined, even after adjusting for membership size. Trends in participation were highly influenced by location. Participation by attendees from the host continent, and especially the host country, is generally high. The negative impact of distant meetings is profoundly seen with North Americans, whereas the positive impact of a nearby meeting was mostly clearly demonstrated by South Americans. Although SRS AM overlapped with holidays in China, Japan, or Korea nearly 50% of the time, this did not influence participation by delegates from these countries.
2::We used the difference in restricted mean survival time (RMST) between DPP-4 inhibitors and placebo to evaluate the risk of cardiovascular events, including hospitalization for heart failure associated with DPP-4 inhibitors. Three randomized clinical trials with cardiovascular events as a primary end point-EXAMINE (alogliptin), SAVOR-TIMI 53 (saxagliptin), and TECOS (sitagliptin)-were reevaluated by estimating the RMSTs for the DPP-4 inhibitors and placebo based on the reconstructed individual patient data for each time-to-event outcome from publicly available information.
3::Two of the observers were very experienced general autopsy pathologists, one was a first-year pathology resident on his first rotation on the autopsy service, and the fourth observer was a highly experienced cardiovascular pathologist. Interobserver reliability was assessed by determination of the intraclass correlation coefficient. The degrees of agreement for two H&E- and Movat-stained sections of the LADs from each of 10 decedents were 0.874 and 0.899, respectively, indicating strong interobserver agreement. On the average, the mean visual scores were ~8% less than the morphometric assessment (52.7 vs. 60.2), respectively.
4::Astrocytes attenuate propofol-induced neurotoxicity through BDNF-mediated cell survival pathway suggesting multiple neuroprotective strategies such as administration of BDNF, astrocyte-conditioned medium, decreasing mitochondrial fission, or inhibition of GSK3β.
2::Data are derived from three independent, German population-based, prospective studies: the control sample of BiDirect (N = 966), the second follow-up of SHIP (N = 2333), and a subsample of SHIP-Trend (N = 1269). RLS was assessed with questions based on the RLS minimal criteria. ABI was measured with an automated method in BiDirect and with Doppler ultrasound in both SHIP studies. An ABI score below 0.9 was indicative of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Co-morbidities, medications and behavioural factors were self-reported. Additional measurements included body mass index and haemoglobin from blood serum. For BiDirect, a follow-up with identical methodology was performed after a median of 2.5 years.
3::Latent class analysis indicated six distinct sleep quality classes in children, namely good sleep, moderate sleep quality, mild sleep disturbances, short sleep, long sleep, and disordered sleep. In general, the disordered sleep and minor sleep disturbance classes had poorer HRQOL, which worsened over time. The long sleep and moderate sleep quality classes also showed some decreases in HRQOL over time.
4::Limitations in the available literature prevent firm conclusions from being reached about the relative economic merits of the various approaches to the prevention of PIs. The authors review revealed a need for additional high-quality studies that adhere to commonly used standards of both currently utilized and emerging ways to prevent hospital-acquired PIs.'
3::MTHFR and MTR mRNA levels were higher while protein levels were lower, and MTR CpG sites were hypermethylated in the preterm group, as compared with the term group. Methylated CpG sites were negatively associated with maternal plasma vitamin B12 levels.
2::CT-scan slices of 228 maxillary sinuses (from 144 men and 144 women) were studied. The maximum height, maximum anterior-posterior diameter, maximum width, and maximum distance between the sinuses were measured in both sexes. Our participants were divided into three age groups of 20-34, 35-49, and over 50 to compare the recorded measurements in different age groups.
3::Most patients were prescribed at least one opioid medication (57%; n = 1,020). A significant interaction and main effects of pain intensity and pain catastrophizing on opioid prescription were noted (P < 0.04). Additive modeling revealed sex differences in the relationship between pain catastrophizing, pain intensity, and opioid prescription, such that opioid prescription became more common at lower levels of pain catastrophizing for women than for men.
4::The association of dementia or cognitive impairment was significantly higher in the patients who were on statin therapy compared to the patients who were not on a statin.
2::In total, 349 outpatients on treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (131 men and 218 women; mean age ± standard deviation: 65 ± 11 years) with no history of cardiovascular events, including ischemic stroke, were enrolled. The whole blood passage time (WBPT) as a marker of hemorheology and the PI of CCA were measured using commercial devices, and their relationships to various clinical parameters were examined.
3::A significant positive correlation was observed between WBPT and the PI of CCA (r = 0.49, P < 0.001). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that patients with high WBPT (≥70 s) had significantly higher risk (odds ratio: 5.2; 95% confidence interval: 2.4 - 9.2; P < 0.001) of being detected with a high PI of CCA (≥ 2) than those with low WBPT (≤ 52.0 s).
3::More than half of pediatric nurses had missed care on their previous shift. On average, pediatric nurses missed 1.5 necessary care activities. Missed care was more common in poor versus better work environments (1.9 vs 1.2; P < .01). For 9 of 12 nursing activities, the prevalence of missed care was significantly higher in the poor environments (P < .05). In regression models that controlled for nurse, nursing unit, and hospital characteristics, the odds that a nurse missed care were 40% lower in better environments and increased by 70% for each additional patient.
4::MHT may cause non-allergic rhinitis in postmenopausal women. Age and obesity may also affect the occurrence of non-allergic rhinitis in postmenopausal women.
3::Internal consistency reliability was acceptable for the total and domain scores at Baseline and Exit (Cronbachs α was 0.92 and 0.94 at Baseline and Exit, respectively, for the total score). Test-retest reliability was demonstrated (intraclass correlation coefficients >0.7) for total score and the Activity and Impacts domains. Convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated with measures associated or not associated with respiratory-related health status. Known groups validity based on baseline FEV1% predicted, Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-5 score, exacerbations and eosinophil counts was demonstrated for the SGRQ total and domain scores. Responses to therapy based on clinician-rated response, patient-rated response, ACQ-5 change score and exacerbations generally correlated with improvements in SGRQ scores.'
2::The expression levels of miR-200c-5p and MAD2L1 in HCC tissues, adjacent tissues as well as HCC cell lines were detected by RT-qPCR or Western blot. The interaction between miR-200c-5p and MAD2L1 was verified by dual luciferase reporter gene system. Transfection was performed to manipulate the expression of miR-200c-5p and MAD2L1 in HCCLM3 cells. Colony formation, MTT, wound healing and Transwell assays were applied to measure the cell proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC, besides, flow cytometry analysis was also conducted to evaluate HCC cell cycle and apoptosis.
4::Through the orthotopic implantation technique described, we demonstrate a highly reproducible model that recapitulates both local and systemic aspects of human PC.
3::Fifty-six patients were identified; 26 (46%) of the 56 patients experienced partial response, 24 (43%) of 56 experienced stable disease, and 6 (11%) of 56 experienced progression of disease. O-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase status was available for 36 tumors. For tumors with partial response, 10 (67%) of 15 were MGMT deficient, and 5 (33%) of 15 were MGMT intact. For tumors with stable disease, 7 (47%) of 15 were MGMT deficient, and 8 (53%) of 15 were MGMT intact. For tumors with progression of disease, 3 (50%) of 6 were MGMT deficient, and 3 (50%) of 6 were MGMT intact.
2::A systematic search of the literature was conducted for perioperative mortality risk prediction models for patients with AAA published since 2006. PRISMA guidelines were used; quality was appraised, and data were extracted and interpreted following the CHARMS guidelines.
4::Safety was excellent during all DQRF procedures and over the 12 months following the end of the treatment sessions. VLQ, PISQ-12 and SSQ scores (women with vaginal laxity), VAS self-evaluation of VVA/GSM symptoms and overall satisfaction with sexual life (women with VVA/GSM symptoms) improved rapidly, reaching almost normal levels by the last DQRF session and suggesting rapid, but also persistent, vaginal rejuvenation in both indications. A late tendency to some slight deterioration in women treated for vaginal laxity suggests such women might benefit from new DQRF treatments 6 to 9 months after the previous cycle.
3::Among the 1011 patients of the primary cohort, 631 (62.4%) were admitted to the ICU for severe sepsis (55%) or septic shock (45%). Among them, 210 (33.3%) patients received a median of 2 [interquartile 1-3] packed red cells during the first 48 h. Hemoglobin levels were lower in transfused patients at days 1 and 2 and became similar to those of non-transfused patients at day 3. Early RBC transfusion was more likely in patients with myeloid neoplasms and neutropenia. Transfused patients displayed more severe presentations as assessed by higher admission SOFA scores and blood lactate levels and the further requirements for organ failure supports. RBC transfusion within the first two days was associated with higher day 7 (20.5 vs. 13.3%, p = 0.02), in-ICU (39 vs. 25.2%, p < 0.001) and in-hospital (51 vs. 36.6%, p < 0.001) mortality rates. RBC transfusion remained independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality in multivariate logistic regression (OR 1.52 [1.03-2.26], p = 0.03) and propensity score-adjusted (OR 1.64 [1.05-2.57], p = 0.03) analysis.
2::A 6-year prospective study (May 2009-March 2015) in the medical ICU of an 850-bed university-affiliated hospital was conducted.
3::Overall, the prevalence of ideal health behaviours was low; non-smoking (60.9% ideal), body mass index (76.8%), physical activity (62.1%), and diet (1.7%). The prevalence of ideal health factors was; total cholesterol (65.8%), blood pressure (62.0%) and plasma glucose (88.8%).
4::The low prevalence of iCVH behaviours, especially diet and physical activity, identified in European adolescents is likely to influence later cardiovascular health which strongly motivates efforts to increase ideal health behaviours in this population.
2::MBP was chronically administered to mice in their drinking water for 3 wk, and body weight, water intake, and bone mineral density were measured. Additionally, plasma bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform 5b, and ghrelin concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To examine the direct effect of MBP on ghrelin secretion, gastric tissue culture and primary mucosal cells were stimulated by MBP.
3::We found significant differences in the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale between patients who had and had not received respite admission. Qualitative analysis of the data indicated that respite admission was a contributory factor in continuing and stabilizing home care. Limited provision of social services and hospital care quality were barriers to respite admission.
1::The aim of this study was to analyze the feasibility and diagnostic performance of F-FDG PET/MR compared with F-FDG PET/CT in a cohort of pediatric histiocytosis patients with regard to image quality, lesion detection, and FDG quantification.
4::MAP2K6-FP enhanced the sensitiveness of paclitaxel for ovarian cancer via inducing autophagy.
2::Using National HIV Behavioral Surveillance data from 2008, 2011, and 2014, we assessed trends in self-reported syphilis testing and diagnoses in the past 12 months among MSM. We calculated percentages of syphilis screening and diagnosis by selected characteristics for each year. Trends were assessed using Poisson regression models with generalized estimation equations. Analysis of syphilis diagnosis was limited to participants who reported syphilis screening.
3::The sample comprised 500, 514, and 525 participants in 2005, 2009, and 2012, respectively. Significant (P < 0.05) linear trends in risk behaviors included a decline in unsafe syringe sources (60.8%, 31.3%, 46.7%; RR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.92), an increase in all syringes from syringe exchanges or pharmacies (35.4%, 67.5%, 50.3%; RR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.22), and an increase in condomless vaginal or anal sex (53.6%, 71.2%, 70.3%; RR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.19). Receptive syringe sharing (21.4%, 27.0%, 25.1%), sharing drug preparation equipment (45.4%, 43.4%, 46.7%), and having ≥2 sex partners (51.2%, 44.0%, 50.7%) were stable. Although HIV seroprevalence declined (18.1%, 12.5%, 12.2%), HCV seroprevalence was high (68.2%, 75.8%, 67.1%). In multivariate analysis, adjusting for sample characteristics significantly associated with time, linear time trends remained significant, and the decline in HIV seroprevalence gained significance (adjusted RR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.91, P = 0.003).
2::Consecutive inclusions in the context of a multidisciplinary consultation centered on disability of the hand with collection of clinical data [cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF), history of trophic disorders of ischemic origin, peripheral pulse palpation, Allen maneuver the upper (UL) and lower limbs (LL)], and hemodynamic data (flow recorded by Doppler in radial, ulnar, anterior and posterior tibial arteries, and measurement of systolic indices ankles).
3::A total of 811 brain metastases received RT in 119 geriatric patients. The median overall survival from the diagnosis of brain metastases was 4.3 months for the patients undergoing WBRT and 14.4 months for the patients undergoing SRS. On multivariate analysis, WBRT was associated with worse overall survival in this cohort of geriatric patients (odds ratio [OR] 3.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-7.0, P<.0001) and age ≥80 years was not. WBRT was associated with significantly greater rates of any grade 1 to 4 toxicity (OR 7.5, 95% CI 1.6-33.3, P=.009) and grade 2 to 4 toxicity (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.0-8.1, P=.047) on multivariate analysis. Elderly and very elderly patients did not have significantly different statistically acute toxicity rates when stratified by age.
4::Comorbid symptoms in BD tend to cohere into Internalizing and Externalizing disorders, which could simplify research and treatment on comorbidity in BD.
3::Patients who took medication more than once a day were more likely to comply with times of taking medication (p = .009); people using polytherapy were more likely to forget to take their medication (p < .001). Married persons missed a dose of a drug considerably less often than other patients (p = .001). The youngest patients were the least likely to miss drug doses (p = .026). The oldest patients (p = .003) and divorced patients also were more likely to miss doses (p = .003).
2::We analyzed data for 240 respondents located in the United States who were recruited online. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of 3 conditions, where they viewed a PSA with hope appeals, fear appeals, or non-emotional appeals. Respondents then answered a series of questions about their attitudes about HIV/AIDS; testing behavior; engagement with HIV/AIDS-related people, organizations, and issues; and HIV/AIDS knowledge. We then performed MANOVA analyses and Pearson correlations.
3::The MDQ items were best captured by a two-factor structure consisting of dimensions labeled Positive Activation and Negative Activation. These two factors showed very different patterns of associations with personality, other psychopathology, and ratings of significant impairment, the last of which is a requirement for a positive MDQ screen using traditional scoring methods.
4::This research confirms there is very little integration of HIE into health systems readmissions initiatives. There is a great opportunity to achieve population health targets using the HIE infrastructure. Hospitals should consider partnering with primary care clinics to implement multifaceted transitions of care programs to significantly reduce 30-day readmission rates.
3::Bland-Altman analysis showed the average bias between VERIS HIV-1 Assay and COBAS HIV-1 Test, RealTime HIV-1 Assay, and VERSANT HIV-1 Assay to be 0.28, 0.39, and 0.61 log10 cp/mL, respectively. Bias at low end levels below 1000cp/mL showed predicted bias to be <0.3 log10 cp/mL for VERIS HIV-1 Assay versus COBAS HIV-1 Test and RealTime HIV-1 Assay, and <0.5 log10cp/mL versus VERSANT HIV-1 Assay. Analysis on 174 specimens tested with the 0.175mL volume VERIS HIV-1 Assay and COBAS HIV-1 Test showed average bias of 0.39 log10cp/mL. Patient monitoring results using VERIS HIV-1 Assay demonstrated similar viral load trends over time to all comparators.
2::Here, we tracked the behavioral performances of 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-month-old AD mice and investigated the expression level of Drebrin in their hippocampi. A Pearson correlation analysis between Drebrin levels and behavioral data was performed. Subsequently, 2-month-old AD mice were injected with rAAV-zsGreen-Dbn1 vector, composing the APP/PS1-Dbn1 group, and sex- and age-matched AD mice were injected with rAAV-tdTomato vector to serve as the control group. All mice were conducted behavioral tests and molecular detection 6 months later.
4::Immunophenotyping by multicolor flow cytometry is useful to evaluate immune status and contributes to the diagnosis and management of patients with PIDDs.
3::One hundred and twenty-six participants were available for longitudinal analysis (64 intervention and 62 control). Annual WMH volume increase in milliliter was similar for intervention (mean=0.73, SD=0.84) and control (mean=0.70, SD=0.59) participants (adjusted mean difference, -0.08 mL; 95% confidence interval, -0.30 to 0.15; P=0.50). Analyses suggested greater intervention effects with increasing baseline WMH volumes (P for interaction=0.03). New lacunar infarcts developed in 6 (9%) intervention and 2 (3%) control participants (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-12.1; P=0.36).
2::A hypothesis-testing, prospective longitudinal, case-control study assessed exposure to Hg from Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines (TM-HepB) among cases diagnosed with atypical autism (n=164) and controls (n=15,216). Automated medical records for subjects born from 1991 to 2000 and continuously enrolled in the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) database were examined.
3::The expression of miR-152 was down-regulated while the expression of DNMT1 was up-regulated in both glioma tissue and cell lines. MiR-152 was hypermethylated and its expression was negatively correlated with DNMT in glioma cell lines. DNMT1 knockdown promoted the expression of miR-152, however, DNMT1 overexpression suppressed the expression of miR-152. MiR-152 overexpression promoted glioma cell apoptosis while miR-152 knockdown promoted cell proliferation. MiR-152 targets Runx2 to regulate its expression, Runx2 overexpression abolished the effects of miR-152 overexpression.
2::This was a prospective observational cohort study of women at 37 0/7 to 41 6/7 weeks of gestation without pre-existing medical complications who presented to our hospital-based triage unit with symptoms of labor and underwent a standardized evaluation. Women diagnosed as having false labor with a live singleton fetus in cephalic presentation without a prior cesarean delivery and sent home were compared with a group of similar women diagnosed to be in spontaneous labor. Women with hypertension, diabetes, and known fetal malformations were excluded. Using a perinatal composite outcome of respiratory insufficiency, intraventricular hemorrhage, culture-proven sepsis, Apgar score 3 or less at 5 minutes, phototherapy, and perinatal death, we tested the noninferiority of being sent home compared with being admitted for labor. The relationship of cervical dilatation to the time interval from discharge home to delivery was also analyzed.
4::Oral antibiotic preparation alone significantly reduced surgical site infection, anastomotic leak, postoperative ileus, and major morbidity after elective colorectal surgery. A combined regimen of oral antibiotics and mechanical bowel preparation offered no superiority when compared with oral antibiotics alone for these outcomes. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A358.
3::A total of 151 eligible patients were identified, and 142 patients (94.0%) participated after a median of 19 months from surgery. Bowel dysfunction was observed in 71.1% (101/142) of patients, with 44.4% (63/142) reporting severe dysfunction. Symptoms of urgency and clustering were found to be major disturbances. Regression analysis identified preoperative long-course radiotherapy (p < 0.001) and a lower-third tumor (p = 0.002) independently associated with severe bowel dysfunction. Irradiated patients with a lower-third tumor (OR = 14.06; p < 0.001) or thickening of the rectal wall (OR = 11.09; p < 0.001) had a markedly increased risk of developing severe dysfunction.
4::The appearance of microbes on various body surface areas determines the overall health status of the individual in significant manner. The change in composition of microbioma in pregnant woman is well known. It was believed that the placenta and the body of the newborn is sterile environment. Modern diagnostic methods proved the presence of microorganisms inside the fetoplacentar unit without the signs of inflammation. Mutual interaction between the immune system of the mother, microbioma and immune system of the newborn can decrease the risk of serious obstetrical syndromes as well as define the lifelong health status of the newborn. The risk can be decreased by the administration of probiotics during the pregnancy.
3::Substance use marginally predicted increased odds of rearrest at one wave, and rearrest significantly (p < .05) predicted increased odds of substance use at another. As such, the results provide limited evidence for a degree of lagged mutual causation; associations vary over the reentry process and are complicated by other realities of life after prison. A key finding is that both behaviors are more consistently influenced by other factors, such as service needs and instrumental and emotional supports.
1::To evaluate the quality of reduction, clinical outcomes and complications of associated both column acetabular fractures with posterior wall involvement that are treated through single ilioinguinal approach and fixation of posterior wall by lag screws only.
2::A retrospective review of medical records and radiographs following ESF placement was performed.
3::We had 402 RA patients participate in the study (response rate, 52%). Of the patients randomized to the Pharm Booklet, 30.6% elected to initiate etanercept. Only 14.6% and 14.0% of patients who reviewed the LONG DA or SHORT DA choose to take etanercept (χ2 = 15.7; P < 0.001). Patients who reviewed the LONG DA or SHORT DA had a greater increase in knowledge about etanercept than those who reviewed the Pharm Booklet. There was no difference in decisional conflict among the groups. A logistic regression model explained 44.2% (R(2) = 0.442) of patient choice to intensify therapy by initiating etanercept. The strongest predictor of choice to intensify therapy were beliefs about etanercepts ability to improve symptoms (OR = 2.56, 96%CI [1.71, 3.80]), and its use by others like the respondent (OR = 2.24, 95%CI [1.49, 3.35]). Mediation analysis confirmed the presence of a partial mediating effect of decision support on patients' intent to take etanercept (OR = 0.59, 95%CI [0.39, 0.89]).'
2::We reviewed the charts and SABR plans from patients treated for T1-T2N0 peripheral non-small-cell lung cancer between 2009 and 2015. The CW structure was created through a 3-cm expansion of the lung. The median dose delivered to the planning target volume was 60 Gy. SABR was delivered in three fractions for patients with CW V30 < 30 cm(3). If the CW V30 exceeded 30 cm(3), five fractions were used, and the plan was optimized based on CW V37 (biologically equivalent to the V30 of three-fraction plans).
