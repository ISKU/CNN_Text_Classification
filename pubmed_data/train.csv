2:::A retrospective, observational, transversal and analytic case-control study was made. All premature birth incidences were determined as study objects and controls were integrated with term deliveries. A sample size of 344 patients with a control per case was calculated. A total of 688 patients were studied. Statistical analysis was descriptive, univariate and bivariate and we used the Pearson chi square test, with a p < 0.05, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
2:::109 deceased donor kidney transplants were included. 5-year probability of graft survival was calculated during transplantation, seven days after transplantation and 1-year after transplantation. Z-test and ROC curves were used for proportion differences and discrimination ability.
2:::With IRB approval, a single-institution retrospective review was performed of patients who underwent surgical excision of ADH diagnosed by core biopsy from June 2005 to June 2013. We reviewed electronic medical records, breast imaging, and biopsy slides. Multiple imputation was used for missing data. Association of various features with cancer upgrade was assessed using logistic regression.
2:::Patients presenting to 41 Australian hospitals with an ACS diagnosis between 2009 and 2016 were stratified according to discharge prescription with DAPT and single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) or no antiplatelet therapy. Multiple stepwise logistic regression, accounting for within hospital clustering, was used to determine the independent predictors of DAPT non-prescription, defined as discharge with SAPT alone or no antiplatelet agent.
2:::Descriptive, cross-sectional and correlational study with a group of 50 PPwH and their parents. The Pediatric Life Quality Questionnaire [PedsQLTM 4.0] was completed by PPwH and their parents and the Childrens Depression Inventory (CDI) was answered only by PPwH.'
2:::The effects of the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) modulated 1800MHz RFR exposure on the expression and activity of glutamate receptor channels with antioxidative activity in brain tissue was measured using oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and electron spin resonance (ESR) detection of the hydroxyl radical generated by the Fenton reaction. NMDA-NR1 was measured in the cerebral tissue of rats with inflammation (complete Freunds adjuvent) and those injected with tramadol after RFR exposure (RFR, RFR/TRAM) and in non-exposed (baseline, TRAM) rats.'
2:::Publically available data from New York State aggregated at hospital and operator level were downloaded by Department of Health website for in-hospital/30-day mortality after PCI, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and valve surgery. Correlations between RAMRs were evaluated by using Spearmans coefficient (rho). The proportion of mortality variation attributed to hospitals and operators was estimated.'
2:::Between January 2005 and September 2013, we recruited consecutive patients undergoing routine angiography 6-18months after implantation of a drug-eluting stent (DES). Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent predictors of ISR, and the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated.
2:::We conducted a retrospective review involving ninety-nine consecutive patients with associated both column fractures of acetabulum treated through single ilioinguinal approach. Patients were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of 35 patients presented with both column fractures with posterior wall involvement that fixation performed with lag screws. This group was compared to a second group of 64 patients with both column fractures without posterior wall involvement. The quality of reduction was assessed using criteria described by Matta. The size of posterior wall fragment was measured. Functional outcome was evaluated using Modified Postel Merle DAubigne score. Radiographs at the latest follow up were analyzed for arthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence classification), and femoral head avascular necrosis (Ficat/Arlet classification).'
2:::Cross-sectional data from three independent cohorts, consisting of healthy adult males (Male Cohort, n = 323) and healthy postmenopausal women (Female Cohort 1, n = 185; and Female Cohort 2, n = 1471), are reported. Associations between serum phosphate and weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass and bone mineral density (BMD) were assessed. In a fourth cohort of postmenopausal women (FGF23 Cohort, n = 20), associations between fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), weight and BMI were assessed.
2:::We rely on data from the Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative (SVORI) evaluation and employ cross-lagged panel models to examine short-term changes in substance use and crime over time among a large sample of high-risk, former prisoners (N = 1697).
2:::We retrieved data on patients with ischemic stroke from the DUST (Dutch Acute Stroke Study). Migraine history was assessed with a migraine screener and confirmed by telephone interview based on the ICHD criteria (International Classification of Headache Disorders). We assessed intra- and extracranial atherosclerotic changes and quantified intracranial internal carotid artery calcifications as measure of atherosclerotic burden on noncontrast computed tomography and computed tomographic angiography. We calculated risk ratios with adjustments for possible confounders with multivariable Poisson regression analyses.
2:::We obtained minimum stocking requirements for 50 states and the District of Columbia in 2017 from WIC Web pages or e-mail from the state WIC agency. We developed a coding protocol to compare minimum quantities and varieties required for 12 food and beverage categories. We calculated the median, range, and interquartile range for each measure.
2:::ICU patients were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter cohort study. Whole blood was collected on the day of admission (D1) and on day 3 (D3) and day 6 (D6) after admission. Patients were screened daily for IAI occurrence and data were censored after IAI diagnosis. mRNA expression levels of biomarkers were measured using RT-qPCR. Fine and Gray competing risk models were used to assess the association between gene expression and IAI occurrence.
2:::This was an 18-week, naturalistic, open, prospective, two-center study. After a baseline period of 10 weeks, 33 outpatients on stable treatment with branded LEV (Keppra(®)) either continued with this product or were switched overnight to a generic LEV preparation (1A Pharma) for an eight-week study period. Throughout the study, patients were monitored with bi-weekly LEV serum concentration measurements and seizure diaries.
2:::We evaluated patients with HSS with or without concomitant liver cirrhosis. All patients underwent laboratory testing, ultrasound, endoscopy, contrast echocardiography, and arterial blood gas analysis.
2:::Data from three waves of the longitudinal South African National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) were analysed to estimate the association between negative household events and adult depressive symptoms using ordinary least squares (OLS) and fixed-effects regression models.
2:::Intraoperative data were prospectively collected in 1080 patients undergoing pulmonary resection with OLV, intentional crystalloid restriction, and mechanical ventilation to maintain inspiratory peak airway pressure <30 cm H2O. Other ventilator settings and all aspects of anesthetic management were at the discretion of the anesthesia care team. We defined PLV and non-PLV as <8 or ≥8 mL/kg (predicted body weight) mean tidal volume. The primary outcome was the occurrence of pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Propensity score matching was used to generate PLV and non-PLV groups with comparable characteristics. Associations between outcomes and PLV status were analyzed by exact logistic regression, with matching as cluster in the anatomic and nonanatomic lung resection cohorts.
2:::Eleven cadaveric elbows were examined through standard anteromedial, anterolateral and posterior portals. The FOV was marked with dye using a spinal needle. The articular surfaces were then exposed and the percentage FOV seen was calculated. FOV percentage areas were compared using a Students t-test (JMP, version 10, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.'
2:::A systematic review of the literature reporting expectations of BR published between 1 January 1994 and 6 March 2017 identified 2107 initial search results. Twenty-one publications, reporting 20 studies (2288 participants), satisfied the selection criteria. Information on study aim and time frame, participation rate, design/methods, limitations/bias, results and conclusions, as well as participant clinical and demographic information, was reported. An overall quality score was generated for each study.
2:::Demineralized dentin specimens were tested into four groups: (1) dentin control, (2) dentin coated with PAMAM, (3) dentin with NACP nanocomposite, (4) dentin with PAMAM plus NACP composite. Specimens were treated with lactic acid at pH 4 without initial Ca and P ions for 21 days. Acid neutralization and Ca and P ion concentrations were measured. Dentin specimens were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and hardness testing vs. remineralization efficacy.
2:::A prospective, observational, single-centered study was conducted in a surgical ICU. For each patient, total cholesterol, HDL, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were assessed at admission. Short-term prognosis outcome was prospectively assessed.
2:::In this systematic review, eligible trials were identified via searches of databases (PubMed, Allied and Complementary Medicine, EMBASE, PEDro, Science Citation Index Expanded, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, SPORTDiscus) from citation tracking and hand-searching. Studies were included if they were randomised trials of a structured exercise intervention (versus usual care) for participants with coronary heart disease and reported at least one of cardiovascular mortality, total mortality, myocardial infarction or revascularisation outcomes. Each included trial was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Authors were also contacted for missing intervention details or data. Random effects meta-analysis was performed to calculate a summary risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the effect of exercise on outcomes. Random effects meta-regression and subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the association between pre-specified co-variates (exercise components or trial characteristics) and each clinical outcome.
2:::Herein, we examined if, relative to a grain-based mouse diet (chow), compositionally defined diet consumption would impact development of intestinal inflammation induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and moreover, whether DSS-induced colitis might also be attenuated by diets supplemented with inulin.
2:::In a randomized, 4-way crossover study, 14 healthy subjects received pulsatile dl-MPH (40 mg) or d-MPH (20 mg), with or without ethanol (0.6 g/kg), dosed 4 hours later. These 4 hours allowed the delayed-release second MPH pulse to reach a more distal region of the gut to preclude gastric biopharmaceutical influences. Plasma was analyzed using a highly sensitive chiral method. Subjective/physiological effects were recorded.
2:::In a randomised, double-blind study, 162 adult patients with persistent/recurrent or de novo Cushings disease received pasireotide. Patients with mean urinary free cortisol at/below the upper limit of normal or clinical benefit at month 12 could continue receiving pasireotide during an open-ended, open-label phase, the outcomes of which are described herein.'
2:::The effects of i.v. bolus injections (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg) of isometheptene racemate, (S)-isometheptene or (R)-isometheptene on heart rate and blood pressure were analyzed in control experiments. The enantiomer producing more pronounced tachycardic and/or vasopressor responses was further analyzed in rats receiving i.v. injections of prazosin (0.1 mg/kg), rauwolscine (0.3 mg/kg), propranolol (1 mg/kg) or intraperitoneal reserpine (5 mg/kg, -24 h).
2:::A regression-discontinuity design was applied to sexual-assault crime data (n = 12,980 incidents) from the national Uniform Crime Reporting survey 2009-2013, a population-level registry of all police-reported crimes in Canada. Uniform Crime Reporting data does not include an explicit alcohol involvement indicator.
2:::To pursue a previous in vitro evaluation, this in vivo 12 months prospective study followed up and compared the access-hole filling integrity of a modified 4-META (4-methacryloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride)/MMA-TBB (methyl methacrylate-tri-n-butyl borane) - based resin (M4M) and a photo-polymerizing nano-hybrid composite resin (CR). Twenty-eight access-holes were filled with both materials respectively, then impressions and intra-oral photographs were taken at T = 0, T = 1 M (month), 3, 6, and 12 M. The access-hole surface measurement and the margin analysis (depth and angle) were carried out. The VAS (visual analogue scale) value on marginal discoloration and integrity at the baseline T = 0 and T = 12 M was recorded.
2:::The PubMed/Medline database was searched from inception to January 16, 2016 for randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials investigating the antidepressant efficacy of psychostimulants in the treatment of adults with unipolar or bipolar depression.
2:::Fifty-nine normal controls and 75 patients with PIDDs, including X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), X-linked hyper IgM syndrome (X-HIGM), ataxia telangiectasia (AT), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), hyper IgE syndrome (HIES), and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis disease (CMCD), were enrolled in this study. Immunophenotyes were evaluated by multicolor flow cytometry using seven different panels that allowed the detection of major leukocyte populations in peripheral blood.
2:::Participants performed ECCarm (n = 9) or concentric arm cycling (CONarm; n = 8) 3×/week while training intensity increased (5-20 min, 60-70% upper-body peak heart rate). Maximum elbow extensor strength, upper-body concentric power, and peripheral and central arterial stiffness were assessed before and after training.
2:::We studied 93 patients (8.0%) with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer without distant metastases from among a total group of 1168 patients who were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer from March 2005 to November 2015 at the Kochi Health Sciences Center, Kochi, Japan. We therefore evaluated the clinical efficacy of CRT in patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer.
2:::One hundred sixty-three infertile women were enrolled and divided into a PCOS group (n = 65) and a non-PCOS group (n = 98). The PCOS group was further divided into an OCP pretreatment group (n = 35) and a non-OCP pretreatment group (n = 30), a TA <0.070 group (n = 34) and a TA ≥0.070 group (n = 31), and a TL <1 group (n = 41) and a TL ≥1 group (n = 24), respectively.
2:::In this single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, conducted at the Profil Institut für Stoffwechselforschung, Germany, 75 adult (aged 18-64 years) participants with type 2 diabetes (eligibility: HbA1c of 6.5-9.0% (47.5-74.9 mmol/mol); BMI 20.0-35.0 kg/m(2); and treatment with diet and exercise and/or metformin monotherapy with a dose unchanged in the 30 days prior to screening) were randomised (1:1) to once-weekly s.c. semaglutide 1.0 mg (0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mg escalated) or placebo for 12 weeks. Co-primary endpoints were changes from baseline to end of treatment in the first (AUC0-10 min) and second (AUC10-120 min) insulin secretion phases, as measured by the IVGTT. An arginine stimulation test (AST) and a 24 h meal stimulation test were also conducted. A graded glucose infusion test (GGIT) assessed insulin secretion rate (ISR) in treated participants and a group of untreated healthy participants. Safety endpoints were also assessed.
2:::Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, who had never taken etanercept (Enbrel), took part in a mail survey. They were presented with a hypothetical decision scenario where they were asked to consider adding etanercept to their current regimen. Each patient was randomized to review 1 of 3 forms of an etanercept-specific decision support: a long PtDA (LONG DA), a short PtDA (SHORT DA), or the manufacturers Enbrel decision guide (Pharm Booklet).'
2:::We pooled data from two French national population-based case-control studies with similar designs conducted in 2003-2004 and 2010-2011. The mothers of 510 CBT cases (directly recruited from the national childhood cancer register) and 3,102 controls aged under 15 years, frequency matched by age and gender, were interviewed through telephone, which included questions about prenatal parental smoking and maternal consumption of alcohol, coffee and tea. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex and study of origin.
2:::Intra-assay and inter-assay reproducibility were determined, and the mean coefficient of variation values obtained were 2.07 and 3.5, respectively. Probit analysis indicated that the 95% detection level was 25 IU/mL. The prevalence of OBI was investigated in 35 serum samples with an anti-HBc alone' profile from individuals who attended our clinic between 2011 and 2013.'
2:::Retrospective analysis of monochorionic biamniotic twin pregnancies without signs of chronic TTTS within a period 10/2010 to 10/2013. Further selection of cases with haemoglobin difference in neonates greater than 50 g/l was made, type of feto-fetal haemorrhage was determined and their prenatal and postnatal characteristics were described.
2:::Traffic noise was calculated for all residential addresses from 1987 to 2012 for 51,283 Danes in the Diet, Cancer and Health Cohort. We used Cox proportional hazard models to investigate the association between residential traffic noise 5 and 10 years before diagnosis, and overall colorectal cancer incidence, as well as subtypes (rectal, proximal, and distal colon). Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated as crude and adjusted for potential confounders.
2:::We monitored self-rated physical, mental, and social health during 100 days using daily visual analogue scale questions in 22 institutionalized older adults (mean age 84.0, SD: 5.9 years). Frailty was determined by the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) frailty index. The resilience indicators (variance, temporal autocorrelation, and cross-correlation) were calculated using multilevel models.
2:::The significance of this work stands on its experimental layout. The experiments were carried out under the same conditions for both languages. Several classification approaches were explored: maximum probability, CRF, Perceptron and SVM. The classifiers were enhanced by means of ensembles of semantic spaces and ensembles of Brown trees. In order to mitigate sparsity of data, without a significant increase in the dimension of the decision space, we propose the use of clustered approaches of the hierarchical Brown clustering represented by trees and vector quantization for each semantic space.
2:::A descriptive study has been performed in two hospitals (UHSA of Villejuif and UHSA of Lille-Seclin). From February to May 2015, 125 adult patients were included, at the end of their hospitalization (voluntary or involuntary psychiatric care) in UHSA. The patients satisfaction was assessed by a psychiatrist who did not participate in patient care with a 16-item scale exploring three areas (quality of care, quality of information provided and UHSA functioning and organization). The items were evaluated with a visual numeric scale (1 to 10).'
2:::Echocardiography was undertaken in a community-based study of 576 participants ≥65 years of age with one or more risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity). Strain analysis was conducted using a dedicated software package, using R-R gating. LV function was classified as normal in the presence of global longitudinal strain (GLS) (≤-18%) or global circumferential strain (GCS) (≤-22%). The associations between GLS or GCS and LA reservoir, conduit, and pump strain were assessed using univariate and multivariate linear regression.
2:::We retrospectively registered 52 patients operated for non-functioning pituitary adenomas, with four or more consecutive MR-investigations not interrupted by secondary treatment. Adenoma volumes were estimated by the Cavalieri principle with summation of manually drawn areas multiplied by slice interval. Growth curves were modelled and tumour volume doubling time was calculated for 39 tumours with regrowth after surgery.
2:::An open, randomized controlled, and parallel trial of postpartum women who were block-randomized to early (up to 48 hours postpartum before discharge) or conventional (at 6 weeks postpartum) insertion of an etonogestrel implant. The primary outcome was average infant weight at 12 months (360 days) and a difference of equal to or greater than 10% between groups was considered clinically significant. The secondary outcomes were infants height and head and arm circumferences. These variables were measured at baseline and at 14, 40, 90, 180, 270, and 360 days postpartum. The mixed-effects linear regression model was used to evaluate the outcomes with a power of 80% and a significance level of 1% for the primary outcome and 0.3% for secondary outcomes as a result of correction for multiple hypothesis testing.'
2:::We describe a prospective observational study of a project conducted between March 2012 and February 2017 to assist clinicians in meeting the Leapfrog Group (www.leapfroggroup.org) target rates for episiotomy. Phases of this project included preintervention (phase 1, March 2012 to April 2014), education and provision of collective department episiotomy rates (phase 2, May 2014 to December 2014), ongoing education with emphasis on a revised Leapfrog target rate (phase 3, January 2015 to February 2016), and provision of individual episiotomy rates to practitioners on a monthly basis (phase 4, March 2016 to February 2017). We analyzed the department episiotomy rates before, during, and after these efforts. Cases of shoulder dystocia were excluded from this analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed Student t test and χ test with P<.05 considered significant.
2:::This is a cross-sectional analysis of State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Databases from 16 states with complete information for year 2011. Adult women undergoing hysterectomy were included. Procedure volume, route, and associated patient and surgical characteristics were calculated.
2:::We searched in EBSCO, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and NCBI databases and other articles manually from lists of references of extracted articles.
2:::We conducted a prospective observational cohort study by recruiting all women undergoing cesarean delivery during an 8-week period, excluding those with major postoperative morbidities or chronic opioid use. Starting on postoperative day 14, women were queried weekly regarding number of opioid pills used, amount remaining, and their pain experience until they had stopped opioid medication. Demographic and delivery information and in-hospital opioid use were recorded. The state Substance Monitoring Program was accessed to ascertain prescription-filling details. Morphine milligram equivalents were calculated to perform opioid use comparisons. Women in the highest quartile of opioid use (top opioid quartile use) were compared with those in the lowest three quartiles (average opioid use).
2:::Patient characteristics, surgical and dosimetric features, and outcome were collected prospectively at the time of treatment and during the follow-up.
2:::Of 510 patients undergoing surgical resection for liver hemangioma in 118 Japanese centers between 1998 and 2012, abdominal symptoms, diagnostic accuracy, and surgical outcomes were analyzed to propose size-based surgical indications. Patients were classified into four groups based on tumor size: Group A ≤5 cm (n = 122, 24%), Group B 5-10 cm (n = 164, 32%), Group C 10-15 cm (n = 124, 24%), and Group D >15 cm (n = 100, 20%).
2:::The vaporization processes and thermodynamic properties of the Gd2 O3 -Y2 O3 -HfO2 system were studied using high-temperature Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry with a MS-1301 mass spectrometer. Vaporization was carried out using a tungsten twin effusion cell containing the samples under study and pure Gd2 O3 as a reference substance. Electron ionization at an energy of 25 eV was employed in the present study.
2:::The study recruited 2938 individuals with genetic diagnosis of FH belonging to 775 families. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v23.
2:::This is a secondary analysis of the Trial of Mid-Urethral Slings, which compared retropubic and transobturator sling outcomes and included 597 participants from 2006 to 2008. Postoperative assessments included body maps, visual analog scales, Surgical Pain Scales, and medication inventories for 30 days, at 6 weeks, and 6, 12, and 24 months. Postoperative pain prevalence and severity were compared. Mixed models compared pain resolution and severity over time. Regression models compared pain prevalence and severity between types of transobturator slings. Eighty percent power was provided for the primary outcome pain prevalence and 95% power was provided for the primary outcome pain severity.
2:::This study enrolled 20 patients with glioma to analyze the expression pattern of miR-152. Real-time PCR and western blot were used to detect the mRNA or protein expression level, respectively. The relationship between miR-152 and runx2 was detected by Luciferase reporter assay. The methylation level of miR-152 was determined by methylation-specific PCR. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by MTT and Annexin-FITC/PI assay.
2:::The diabetic nephropathy and acute liver injury rats were induced by intraperitoneal injection with streptozotocin (STZ) and carbon tetrachloride (CCL4), respectively. The rats were treated with different doses of rhubarb anthraquinones extract (37.5, 75 and 150mg/kg) as administration groups. For pharmacokinetics, the drug concentrations of rhubarb anthraquinones consisting of rhein, emodin, aloe-emodin, chrysophanol, physcion and sennoside A were determined. For pharmacodynamics, the anti-diabetic nephropathy and hepatoprotective effects were assessed under different dosage regimens.
2:::All major databases were searched for eligible studies. We included 12 case-control/observational studies reporting selenium concentrations in AD and controls. Pooled-overall effect size as standardized mean difference (SMD) and pooled r-values were generated using Review Manager 5.3 and MedCalc 15.8 software.
2:::Tranexamic acid modulation of NMDA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid, and kainate receptors was studied using whole cell voltage-clamp recordings of current from cultured mouse hippocampal neurons.
2:::PREDATORR was an epidemiological cross-sectional study. Between 2012 and 2014, participants were randomly selected from the lists of general practitioners and enrolled if they were aged 20 to 79 years, born and living in the past 10 years in Romania. Sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics were collected through interviewer-administered questionnaires.
2:::The National Institute on Aging convened a workshop in August 2015 on needs for research to improve measures to predict and assess resilience in human aging. Effects of aging-related factors in impairing homeostatic responses were developed from examples illustrating multiple determinants of clinical resilience outcomes. Research directions were identified by workshop participants.
2:::This noninferiority randomized controlled trial was conducted at five centers. After receiving a diagnosis of GDM, women tested their blood glucose every day for 7 days. After that period, compliant women without hyperglycemia requiring treatment were randomized to either blood glucose testing four times a day or every other day. Noninferiority would be declared if the mean birth weight in the every-other-day group was no higher than 165 g (5% difference assuming an average birth weight of 3,296 g) compared with the four times a day group. A total sample size of 286 women allowed noninferiority to be tested (one-sided .05 level of significance).
2:::Vegetable nitrate intake, lifestyle factors, and cardiovascular disease risk factors were determined at baseline (1998). CCA-IMT and plaque severity were measured using B-mode carotid ultrasound (2001). Complete ischemic cerebrovascular disease hospitalizations or deaths (events) over 14.5 years (15 032 person-years of follow-up) were obtained from the West Australian Data Linkage System.
2:::Between October 2009 and October 2011, 35 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer clinical stage T3-4, N0-1, M0 were enrolled into this study. One dose of chemotherapy with oxaliplatin (35 mg/m(2)) on Day 1 and Day 2, leucovorin (200 mg/m(2)) on Day 1, and 5-fluorouracil [5-FU; 2400 mg/m(2) intravenously (i.v.) administered continuously for 48 hours] on Day 1 was administered 2 weeks before preoperative CCRT. During preoperative CCRT, radiation dose of 4500 cGy in 25 fractions was administered to the clinical target volume and 5000 cGy to 5040 cGy in 25 fractions was administered to the gross tumor volume; chemotherapy is administered concomitantly with oxaliplatin (45 mg/m(2)) on Day 1 of radiation therapy (R/T) every 14 days; 5-FU (400 mg/m(2) i.v. bolus for 1 hour) for 5 days on Weeks 1 and 5 of R/T. Operation was performed 4-6 weeks after preoperative CCRT. Acute toxicity profile, overall survival rate, disease-free survival rate, distant metastasis failure-free survival rate, and local recurrence rate were evaluated.
2:::Our study recruited 100 healthy medical college students for the measurement of acupoint temperature. The temperatures of 135 acupoints of 14 main meridians were measured using infrared thermometers in order to provide a comprehensive body temperature reading of each study participant.
2:::Review of the literature.
2:::Using SAS 9.3 Statistical Analysis Software, a shade selection program was developed that incorporated Kubelka-Munk layering data of Herculite Ultra and Estelite Omega composite resins from a characterized database of absorption and scattering information. Test scenarios represented an inquiry based off of a backing selection shade (Shade B) and a target selection shade (ShadeT). For the simulation, the thickness of the layer on the backing was 1.9mm and the CIE illuminant was D65. The selection program was designed to select the shade that would give the lowest CIEDE2000 color difference when selected for the specific target and backing. When using the 3-D Vita shade guide, analysis between direct reflectance data and RGB data regressed to reflectance data was included in order to verify accuracy of the regression.
2:::Data from resuscitations performed by St John Ambulance Western Australia (SJA-WA) paramedics between July 2014 and June 2016 was captured using the Q-CPR feedback device. Logistic regression analysis was used to study the relationship between CCF and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Various lengths of Q-CPR data were used ranging from the first 3min to all available episode data. Cases were subsequently divided into groups based upon downtime; ≤15min, >15min and unknown. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed in each group.
2:::Tissue T (tT) and tissue DHT (tDHT) concentration were determined in 93 patients scheduled for initial prostate biopsy. The criteria for biopsy were abnormal DRE and/or PSA > 4 ng/mL. Total prostate volume (TPV) was determined by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). During TRUS- guided prostate biopsy, 10-12 samples were collected from the peripheral zone (PZ) and two additional samples were collected from the transition zone (TZ). The samples from the TZ were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen at -70°C, and transported for tissue androgen determination, using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
2:::In participants aged 65 to 99 years with incident ischemic strokes from the Cardiovascular Health Study, we evaluated the association of several risk factors (frailty, frailty components, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and cystatin C) assessed before stroke with stroke outcomes of survival, cognitive decline (≥5 points on Modified Mini-Mental State Examination), and activities of daily living decline (increase in limitations).
2:::The cytotoxicity and IC50 of five small molecule compounds (oleandrin, neriifolin, strophanthidin, gitoxigenin, and convallatoxin) in human colon cancer cell line SW480 cells and normal human colon cell line NCM460 cells were determined by cell counting and MTT assays, respectively.

2:::Ten subjects were chosen to participate in this study (average age 40.6 ± 19.6; age range 22-68). LogMAR acuity, contrast sensitivity, corneal fluorescein staining, and subjective complaints were measured before and after 60 μl of Betadine 5% or saline were applied to one eye (eligibility visit, baseline, 5, 30, and 60 minutes and 4 and 24 hours post-application). Contrast sensitivity at 14 cpd was determined with a spatial two-alternative, forced choice procedure (Beethoven software). The National Eye Institute (NEI) grid pattern was used to grade corneal staining with sodium fluorescein. To avoid the detrimental effects of sodium fluorescein administration on functional vision, the corneal staining baseline was measured at the eligibility visit. Subjective complaints were monitored using the Schein dry eye questionnaire.
2:::THC- and CBD concentrations in blood samples from subjects apprehended in Norway from April 2013-April 2015 were included (n=6134).

2:::This paper utilized data from two waves of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, a cohort study that follows a representative population of children in Australia. This paper examined data from Waves 4 and 5 of the LSAC (covering the period 2010-2012) and included 3974 children aged 10-11 years at Wave 4 (51.4% male). Multiple dimensions of sleep quality were assessed using a combination of child- and parent-reported measures. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed through the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory.
2:::We did a cluster-randomised trial in Rusizi district, western Rwanda. We defined villages as clusters. We assessed villages for eligibility then randomly selected 150 for the study using a simple random sampling routine in Stata. We stratified villages by wealth index and by the proportion of children younger than 2 years with caregiver-reported diarrhoea within the past 7 days. We randomly allocated these villages to three study groups: no intervention (control; n=50), eight community health club sessions (Lite intervention; n=50), or 20 community health club sessions (Classic intervention; n=50). Households in these villages were enrolled in 2013 for a baseline survey, then re-enrolled in 2015 for an endline survey. The primary outcome was caregiver-reported diarrhoea within the previous 7 days in children younger than 5 years. Analysis was by intention to treat and per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01836731.
2:::Magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT) techniques encode current flow in phase images. In four human subjects, we used MREIT to measure magnetic flux density distributions caused by tACS currents, and then calculated current density distributions from these data. Computational models of magnetic flux and current distribution, constructed using contemporaneously collected T1-weighted structural MRI images, were co-registered to compare predicted and experimental results.
2:::Participants were assigned to rhythm-and-music therapy, horse-riding therapy, or control using concealed randomization, stratified with respect to sex and stroke laterality. Therapy was given twice a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was change in participants perception of stroke recovery as assessed by the Stroke Impact Scale with an intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary objective outcome measures were changes in balance, gait, grip strength, and cognition. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, postintervention, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up.'

2:::The study population consisted of participants randomized to receive ICM in a multi-center trial. The Reveal LINQ™ ICM was implanted using provided insertion tools, either in an electrophysiology laboratory or outpatient procedure room. If device sensing was insufficient in the first subcutaneous position, one or more repositions were performed. Patients were urged to make contact if they suspected any AE. Furthermore, follow-up for safety endpoints consisted of evaluation of medical records and planned study visits.
2:::We randomized 932 veterans at high risk for developing a KC to either topical 5-FU or vehicle control cream applied to the face and ears for up to 1 month. We collected their Skindex-29 and SCI scores at baseline and follow-up visits.
2:::A total of 2797 patients without significant coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent the acetylcholine (ACH) provocation test between November 2004 and October 2010 were enrolled. Significant CAS was defined as having ≥70% of temporary narrowing by ACH test and ICS as having <70% of fixed stenosis on angiography. Patients were divided into two groups: ICS group (n=764) and non-ICS group (n=845). To adjust potential confounders, a propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed using the logistic regression model. Primary endpoint was the composite of total death, myocardial infraction (MI), de novo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). Secondary endpoint was the incidence of recurrent angina requiring repeat coronary angiography (CAG) at 3years.
2:::Hippocampal astrocytes and neurons isolated from neonatal Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to propofol at a clinically relevant dose of 30 μM or dimethyl sulfoxide as control for 6 hours. Propofol-induced cell death was determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining in astrocyte-alone cultures, neuron-alone cultures, or cocultures containing either low or high density of astrocytes (1:9 or 1:1 ratio of astrocytes to neurons ratio [ANR], respectively). The astrocyte-conditioned medium was collected 12 hours after propofol exposure and measured by protein array assay. BDNF concentration in astrocyte-conditioned medium was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Neuron-alone cultures were treated with BDNF, tyrosine receptor kinase B inhibitor cyclotraxin-B, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) inhibitor CHIR99021, or mitochondrial fission inhibitor Mdivi-1 before propofol exposure. Western blot was performed for quantification of the level of protein kinase B and GSK3β. Mitochondrial shape was visualized through translocase of the outer membrane 20 staining.
2:::We retrospectively reviewed 51 patients diagnosed with pulmonary MALT lymphoma between January 2003 and December 2015. To compare treatment modalities and outcomes, we stratified the patients into low-stage (IE/IIE) and high-stage (IIIE/IVE) groups using modified Ann Arbor staging. Progression-free survival was estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves, and differences were compared using the log-rank test. A hazard ratio of progression by stage strata, adjusted for other clinical variables, was determined using a Cox adjusted proportional hazards model.
2:::Using the Aperio ScanScope XT at a magnification of 20× we created digital whole-slide images of 20 representative microscopic cross sections of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, stained with either hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Movats pentachrome stain. These cross sections illustrated a variety of luminal profiles and degrees of stenosis. Three representative types of images were selected and a visual guide was constructed with Adobe Photoshop CS5. Using the ""Scale"" and ""Measurement"" tools, we created a series of representations of stenosis with luminal cross sections depicting 20%, 40%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% occlusion of the LAD branch. Four pathologists independently reviewed and scored the degree of atherosclerotic luminal narrowing based on our visual guides. In addition, digital technology was employed to determine the degree of narrowing by measuring the cross-sectional area of the 20 microscopic sections of the vessels, first assuming no narrowing and then comparing this to the percent of narrowing determined by precise measurement.'
2:::After surgery induced sciatic nerve injury, the model rats were divided into three groups and treated with curcumin, curcumin+PD98059 and curcumin+IGF-1 respectively for 4days. The phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt, and the expression of LC3-II, Beclin 1 and p62 were measured using western blotting. After treatment for 60days, myelination of the injured sciatic nerve was evaluated by MBP immunohistochemical staining and the expression of PMP22, Fibrin and S100 were determined using qRT-PCR and western blotting. In vitro, RSC96 cells were starved for 12h to induce autophagy, and received DMSO, curcumin, PD98059+curcumin, IGF-1+curcumin and BFA1 respectively.

2:::Neonatal Sprague Dawley rat pups were treated with plumbagin (50, 100 or 150 mg/kg body weight, orally) from postnatal day 2. The pups on postnatal day 7 were subjected to isoflurane (0.75%) exposure for 6 h. Neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal tissues was detected by TUNEL assay and FluroJade B staining following isoflurane exposure. Protein expressions were analysed by immunoblotting. RT-PCR was performed to assess mRNA levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB.
2:::In a 4-week, placebo-controlled crossover design (Study 201; N = 33) and a 12-week parallel-group design (Study 202; N = 93), JZP-110 was evaluated in narcolepsy patients using changes from baseline in the 40-min MWT as the primary endpoint. Effect sizes based on the change from baseline in mean MWT sleep latency were calculated using 20-min censored MWT data and compared to 40-min MWT data.
2:::Pregnant women (N =230), reporting low (n =87), moderate (n =97), or high (n =46) levels of depressive, general anxiety and/or pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms (assessed repeatedly with EPDS, SCL-90/anxiety subscale, PRAQ-R2, respectively) were tested in mid-pregnancy for their cognitive functions. A computerized neuropsychological test battery was used.
2:::A videogame was developed, combining pictures and short videos, by which students are interactively instructed on acting at the surgical block. Moreover, the game includes detailed descriptive information. After playing, students are given feedback on their performance. A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 132 nursing and medical students with no previous experience in surgery. Sixty two (47.0%) were allocated to a control group (CG) and 70 (53.0%) to an experimental group (EG). Subjects in EG played the game the day prior to their first experience in the theatre; CG had no access to the application. On the day after their experience at surgery, all students filled in a questionnaire in a 7-point Likert format collecting subjective data about their experience in the surgical block. Four constructs related to students feelings, emotions and attitudes were measured through self-reported subjective scales, i.e. C1: fear to make mistakes, C2: perceived knowledge on how to behave, C3: perceived errors committed, and C4: attitude/behaviour towards patients and staff. The main research question was formulated as follows: do students show differences in constructs C1-C4 by exposure to the game?'
2:::A sample of 1886 children with a close to equal distribution of age (9 or 12) and gender, enriched for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric problems were selected from the nationwide Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden.

Birth outcomes were ascertained from the birth certificate records of 428,804 births in Ohio from the same time period. Multivariable generalized estimating equation logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between arsenic and each birth outcome separately. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the roles of private well use and prenatal care utilization in these associations.
2:::The reference electrodiagnosis was obtained in 53 demyelinating and 45 axonal GBS patients on the basis of two serial studies and results of anti-ganglioside antibodies assay. We retrospectively employed sparse linear discriminant analysis (LDA), two existing electrodiagnostic criteria sets (Hadden et al., 1998; Rajabally et al., 2015) and one we propose that additionally evaluates duration of motor responses, sural sparing pattern and defines reversible conduction failure (RCF) in motor and sensory nerves at second study.
2:::Twenty nine daily smokers of >10 cigarettes per day, nine with major depression and 20 without, completed two laboratory sessions one week apart, smoking as normal prior to session 1 (sated session), and 6h abstinent prior to session 2 (abstinent session). In both sessions, tobacco-seeking was measured at baseline by preference to view smoking versus food images. Negative mood was then induced by negative ruminative statements and sad music, before tobacco-seeking was measured again at test.
2:::In this study of 251 adult patients who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass procedures at a single center from 2003 to 2006, cases (patients with a postoperative stroke at least 24 hours after surgery) were matched 1:2 to controls without stroke. Minimum and average partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) values, from arterial blood gas values during and up to 24 hours after surgery, were evaluated as continuous and categorical predictors. Conditional logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders (demographics, comorbidities, and intraoperative variables) were used to evaluate associations between PaO2 variables and stroke status.
2:::GWES for MDD with available raw data were searched in NCBI GEO, Array Express and Stanley databases. Raw GWES data were preprocessed and normalized and meta-analytical procedures were carried out with the Network Analyst program. 743 samples from 24 primary studies were included in our meta-analyses for blood (Blo), amygdala (Amy), cerebellum (Cer), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions. A functional enrichment analysis was carried out.
2:::20 TRD patients who underwent a course of rTMS to the left DLPFC were categorized into R and NR groups based on a >50% reduction in HRSD scores.

We examined correlations between the percentages of men who were MSM who also have sex with women and female heterosexual cases. We also examined census data to characterize each city in terms of poverty level and race/ethnicity makeup.
2:::A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in the High Risk Newborn Follow-up Clinic of our institute, on a sample of 166 children, <3 months old. The medications prescribed (syrup preparations of vitamin D, multivitamins, calcium, iron and levetiracetam, tablet L-thyroxine and ursodeoxycholic acid and human milk fortifier powder) were noted from the discharge summary. The caregiver who usually administered the medicines to the child at home was asked the names of the medications, frequency of their administration and to show in a measuring cup/syringe/dropper the dose of the medication. The names, doses and frequency of the drugs as reported were matched against those actually prescribed in the discharge summary. Various risk factors probably associated with medication errors, were noted.
2:::MSM were recruited through venue-based sampling in 2008, 2011, and 2014 in 20 US cities. We examined changes in internet use (IU) to meet men and in meeting the last partner online among MSM from 2008 to 2014 using Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios (APRs). We also examined factors associated with increased frequency of IU using data from 2014. IU was categorized as never, infrequent use (<once a week), and frequent use (≥once a week).

2:::All adult patients with a diagnosis of oesophageal cancer managed at our institute from 2005 to 2015 were included in this retrospective study. Patients demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded through our hospital information system. The cohort of esophagectomies was allocated into two groups, conventional open esophagectomy (OE) or total laparoscopic MIE; hybrid esophagectomies were taken as a separate group. The short-term outcome measures are an operative time in minutes, length of hospital and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay in days, post-operative complications and 30 days in-hospital mortality. Complications are graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification system. Long-term outcomes are long-term procedure related complications over a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Trends were analysed by visually inspecting the graphic plots for mean number of events in each group each year.'

2:::We conducted a stratified case-control study by frequency matching 4 controls to each case within year using clinical data from men who have sex with men (MSM) attending the Seattle STD Clinic 2001 to 2014. Cases were MSM with a new HIV diagnosis and negative HIV test at 12 months or less. Controls were HIV-negative MSM. All included men had rectal STI testing, tested negative for syphilis, and had complete sexual behavior data. We categorized men by RAI: (1) none; (2) condoms for all RAI; (3) condomless RAI only with HIV-negative partners; and (4) condomless RAI with HIV-positive or unknown-status partners. We created 3 logistic regression models: (1) 3 univariate models of concurrent rectal gonorrhea, rectal chlamydia, and rectal STI in 12 months or less with new HIV diagnosis; (2) those 3 infections, plus age, race, year, number of sexual partners in 2 months or less, and methamphetamine use; and (3) model 2 with RAI categories. We calculated the population attributable risk of rectal STI on HIV diagnoses.

2:::Twenty-seven patients (30 implants) were divided into three groups. All implants were 4 mm wide in diameter and 8 mm long. Group A received 10 tapered implants (OSPTX) (Astra Tech OsseoSpeed TX™) using the soft bone surgical protocol (TXSoft). Group B received 10 tapered implants (OSPTX) (AstraTech OsseoSpeedTX™) using the standard surgical protocol (TXStd). Group C received 10 parallel wall implants (OSP) (AstraTech OsseoSpeed™) using the standard surgical protocol (OStd). All implants were placed in the posterior maxilla in areas with a minimum of 8-mm crestal bone height. Resonance frequency measurements (implant stability quotient (ISQ)) and torque values were recorded to determine initial implant stability. All implants were uncovered 6 weeks after placement and restored with a functionally loaded resin provisional screw-retained crown. Resonance frequency measurements were recorded at the time of implant placement, at 6 weeks and 6 and 12 months. Twelve months after implant placement, the stability of the implants was recorded and the final restorations were placed using custom CAD/CAM fabricated abutments and cement-retained PFM DSIGN porcelain crowns. After implant restoration, bone levels were measured at 6 and 12 months with standardized radiographs.

Patients must have been receiving either low- to medium-dosage inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or low-dosage ICS plus long-acting β2 agonist fixed-combination therapy at screening, had a morning prebronchodilator FEV1 of more than 50% to 90% predicted at screening, and had one or more of the following symptoms within the 7 days before randomisation: a daytime or night-time asthma symptom score of at least 1 for at least 2 days, rescue short-acting β2 agonist use for at least 2 days, or night-time awakenings due to asthma for at least one night. We converted patients ICS treatments to 180 μg or 200 μg budesonide dry powder inhaler twice daily for the entire duration of the study using the approved dosages in the patients' respective countries and randomly allocated them (1:1; stratified by blood eosinophil count [<300 cells per μL vs ≥300 cells per μL] and region [USA vs the rest of the world]) with an interactive web-based voice response system to receive subcutaneous placebo or benralizumab 30 mg injections every 4 weeks for 12 weeks. All patients and investigators involved in patient treatment or clinical assessment and those assessing outcomes were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was change from baseline prebronchodilator FEV1 at week 12. Efficacy analyses used an intention to treat approach. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02322775.'
2:::We measured levels of 93 miRNAs most commonly detected in serum. This retrospective cohort study included 150 autoantibody-positive and 150 autoantibody-negative family-matched siblings enrolled in the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention Study. This was a young cohort (mean age = 11 years), and most autoantibody-positive relatives were at high risk because they had multiple autoantibodies, with 39/150 (26%, progressors) developing type 1 diabetes within an average 8.7 months of follow-up. We analysed miRNA levels in relation to autoantibody status, future development of diabetes and OGTT C-peptide and glucose indices of disease progression.
2:::Sixty-seven patients with schizophrenia and thirty healthy control participants (HC) underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to estimate levels of Glx in the white matter of the left prefrontal lobe. The spectrum was estimated from an 8mm(3) voxel placed in the left lateral prefrontal region, belonging to both the cingulum and forceps minor. Patients with lifetime AVH (AVH group; n=45) and patients without lifetime AVH were compared (NoAVH group; n=22) to control participants.
2:::NSCLC cell lines were treated with deguelin. Wound-healing and invasion assays were applied to study the inhibitory effect of deguelin on NSCLC cells. EMT markers, E-cadherin and Vimentin, were also detected by Western blot. NEK2 protein and messenger RNA expression levels were evaluated when NSCLC cells were treated with different concentrations of deguelin. The effect of NEK2 on NSCLC cell metastasis was evaluated through NEK2 knockdown. To investigate whether deguelin induced EMT by regulating NEK2, we overexpressed NEK2 in both NCI-H520 and SK-MES-1 cell lines, and then used real time-PCR to study the E-cadherin and Vimentin messenger RNA expression in both NSCLC cells.
2:::All patients who had loop ileostomy and ileostomy closure between 2012 and 2015 were identified from an IRB-approved, prospectively maintained institutional database.The patients who underwent ileostomy closure (<3 months) were compared against matched patients undergoing ileostomy closure (≥3 months). The outcomes for the two groups were compared.
2:::45 people with schizophrenia and 27 healthy controls completed the Moral-Conventional Distinction Task: a classic task that assesses judgment of violations of moral or social convention on permissibility, severity, and authority-contingence. Justifications of judgments were also probed. Basic cognition was indexed by measures of IQ, verbal memory, and information processing speed. Self-report inventories were used to assess different facets of empathy' (e.g., perspective-taking, or theory of mind, and empathic concern), and aggressive tendencies.'

2:::Sixteen patients were randomly assigned to this cross-over study. Each patient wore a continuous glucose monitor for 5days and consumed identical test meals for 3days. Patients consumed the test meals of dinner at 2100h (D21) or divided dinner (vegetable and rice at 1800h and the vegetable and the main dish at 2100h) on the second or fourth day, and dinner at 1800h (D18) on the third day. The daily glucose parameters were compared within-patient for 3days.
2:::Patients enrolled in the Longitudinal Study of the Ocular Complications of AIDS (LSOCA) underwent 5- and 10-year follow-up retinal photographs. Intermediate-stage AMD (AREDS stage 3) was determined from these photographs by graders at a centralized Reading Center, using the Age-Related Eye Disease Study-2 grading system. The incidence of AMD in LSOCA was compared with that in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-uninfected cohort, which used a similar photographic methodology.
2:::We examined partner-level data between MSM participants (n=23) and their sexual partners (n=52).

2:::The spinotrapezius muscle of Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a single 2-week pretreatment of 0.2 mL saline either with (n = 5) or without (n = 5) 2u BTX. After surgical elevation, an arcade arteriole was observed using a video caliper device. Vessel diameter was measured at 30-second intervals after sequential superfusion of nitroglycerin (100 and 200 μg/mL), multiple concentrations of lidocaine, and a combination of adenosine (10 μM) and nitroprusside (10 μM) to induce maximum dilation.
2:::Macular retinal thickness was evaluated using SDOCT at 1 week before surgery and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively, in 70 POAG and 68 control eyes. Forty-three healthy subjects without impaired vision or cystoid PME were recruited separately as pilot samples to define significant PME. Significant PME was defined as an increase in the average thickness exceeding the mean + 3 standard deviations of the increase shown in the pilot samples.
2:::A case-control study with a convenience sample was designed. Probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing, and plaque were recorded at 6 sites per tooth. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the pain after probing.

Prevalence and clinical correlates of ASD in 93 recovered (euthymic ≥8 weeks) and 153 depressed BD patients were assessed. Kaplan-Meier analyses (Log-Rank tests) assessed relationships between baseline ASD and longitudinal depressive severity, with Cox Proportional Hazard analyses assessing potential mediators.
2:::A multidisciplinary group of clinicians used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual criterion as the foundation for the Vanderbilt Assessment for Delirium in Infants and Children (VADIC). Pediatric-specific modifiers were integrated into the delirium criterion, including key developmental and assessment variations for children. The VADIC was used in clinical practice to prospectively assess critically ill infants and children. The VADIC was assessed for content validity by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Delirium Special Interest Group.

Shock patients who presented with at least one clinical sign of inadequate tissue perfusion, defined as systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or a decrease >40 mmHg in previously hypertensive patients or the need for vasopressive drugs; urine output <0.5 ml/kg/h for 2 h; tachycardia; lactate >4 mmol/l, for less than 24 h in the absence of a contraindication for fluids were eligible to participate in the study. PtcO2 was continuously recorded before and during a passive leg raising (PLR) test, and then before and after a 250 ml rapid saline infusion in 10 min. Fluid responsiveness is defined as a change in the stroke volume ≥10% after 250 ml of volume infusion.
2:::Distribution of ezrin in membrane and cytosol fractions was examined by analysis of detergent-soluble/-insoluble fractions and cytosol/membrane fractionation. Both immunofluorescence and live imaging were used to explore the role of ezrin S66 phosphorylation in the behavior of ezrin and actin in cell filopodia. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion of ESCC cells were investigated by proliferation and migration assays, respectively. Tumorigenesis, local invasion and metastasis were assessed in a nude mouse model of regional lymph node metastasis.
2:::FDG PET/CT was used to measure response of individual lesions to a measured absorbed dose, derived from post-treatment (90)Y PET imaging. Predicted dose was also derived from planning [(99m)Tc]-MAA SPECT data. Peak standardised uptake value and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were explored as response measures, and compared to dose metrics including average dose (D avg), biologically effective dose, minimum dose to 70% of lesion volume and volume receiving at least 50 Gy. Prognostic factors examined included baseline TLG, RAS mutation status, FDG heterogeneity and dose heterogeneity. In an exploratory analysis, response and clinico-pathological variables were evaluated and compared to overall survival.

A repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to examine group differences in emotion recognition.
2:::A total of 138 patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis (SCS) who underwent CEA after acute ischemic stroke from March 2008 to March 2015 were included in this study. Transient ischemic attacks were excluded. These patients were divided into 2 groups according to the topographic pattern of the stroke on magnetic resonance imaging: group 1, territorial strokes (TS) caused by emboli of carotid origin, and group 2, WS caused by a hemodynamic mechanism related to an SCS. Primary end points were 30-day mortality and postoperative neurological morbidity. The insertion of a Pruitt carotid shunt was performed systematically.
2:::Using Delphi technique methodology, panelists from 3 institutions were tasked with developing a list of critical time points, which were subsequently assigned to pause point (PP) categories. Panelists then rated these PPs on a 100-point visual analog scale. Descriptive statistics were expressed as percentages, medians, and interquartile ranges (IQRs). We defined low response variability between panelists as an IQR ≤ 20, moderate response variability as an IQR > 20 and ≤ 40, and high response variability as an IQR > 40.
2:::A mix of qualitative data and quantitative data was gathered to inform the current state of anesthesia at the University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia. Semistructured interviews were conducted with key staff identified by purposive sampling, including staff who had worked at the hospital throughout 2006 to 2015. Further data detailing conditions in the environment were collected by reviewing relevant departmental and hospital records spanning the study period. All data were analyzed thematically, using the framework described in the 2006 study, which described patient care, education, and research related to anesthetic practice at the hospital.
2:::This was a retrospective case-control study. It compared metformin and other hypoglycaemic medication use in diabetic patients with uncomplicated diverticulosis to those with acute diverticulitis. Patients were identified using hospital International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD-10) data, and radiology, pathology and scanned medical record databases were used to confirm diagnoses and collect all information. Chi square tests were used to determine significance of difference in categorical variables, and Mann-Whitney tests were used for continuous data.
2:::A 24-h Holter ECG assessment was performed using either RA based on a computer-aided evaluation and subsequent review by a cardiologist or a commercially available automated SA. In the case of discordant results concerning the occurrence of pAF between the two methods, the data underwent an independent external rating.
2:::This cross-sectional study included 1985 premenopausal women who completed the second visit of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort Study, with a mean age of 42±7years.

2:::After Institutional Review Board and parental approval, 77 children between the ages of 2 and 12 years were studied in a prospective, double-blind manner and randomized into three groups. Group 1 received intranasal saline, while groups 2 and 3 received 0.1 mL/kg of 0.25% or 0.5% phenylephrine, respectively. All received the same anesthetic of halothane, N2 O, O2 , and vecuronium. After inhalation induction, endtidal halothane and PaCO2 were maintained at 1.5% and 35 mm Hg, respectively. Heart rate and rhythm, systolic, diastolic, and mean, noninvasive arterial blood pressures were recorded and venous blood was obtained for measurement of plasma phenylephrine concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography at baseline and at 2, 5, 10, and 20 minutes following intranasal spray application of the study drug. Nasotracheal intubation was performed immediately following the 5-minute measurements, and the presence of bleeding was assessed. Hemodynamic data were compared by analysis of variance for repeated measures. Bleeding and arrhythmia incidence among groups were analyzed using chi-squared tests. Phenylephrine levels were correlated with hemodynamic values via regression analysis.

2:::The research objectives are pursued in the context of critically-ill patients, treated at a busy ED in the period 2010-2012. The primary source of internal and external data is an HIE linked to 14 hospitals, over 1300 clinics, and other clinical facilities. We define four use profiles based on the attributes of duration and volume: quick and basic, quick and deep, slow and basic, and slow and deep. The volume and duration of use are computed using HIE log files as the number of screens and the time per screen, respectively. Each session is then classified into a specific profile based on distances from predefined profile centroids. Experts are physicians that are board-certified in emergency medicine. We test the distribution of use profiles and their associations with multiple variables that describe the patient, physician, situation, information available in the HIE system, and use dynamics within the encounter.
2:::We reviewed all initiated tissue expander/implant reconstructions by the senior authors from January 2004 to December 2015. BRA Score risk estimates were computed for each patient and compared against observed rates of complications. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, concordance statistic, and Brier score were used to assess the calibration, discrimination, and accuracy of the models, respectively.
2:::We retrospectively analyzed clinical and pathological factors in patients who received MPA. Expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor (PgR), androgen receptor, and Ki67 index was assessed with residual tissue samples of endometrial cancer. Expression levels were evaluated semi-quantitatively using the Allred score. Correlations between expression levels and patients characteristics, response to MPA, and survival were assessed.'

2:::To address this, we examined intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) modulated by the perception of dynamic fearful faces among the amygdala and limbic, frontal, temporal and brainstem regions. Regions of interest were identified in an activation analysis by presenting a block-design with dynamic fearful faces and dynamic landscapes to 15 healthy individuals. This led to 10 predominately right-hemispheric regions. Functional connectivity between these regions during the perception of fearful faces was examined in drug-refractory patients with left- (n=16) or right-sided (n=17) MTLE, epilepsy patients with extratemporal seizure onset (n=15) and a second group of 15 healthy controls.
2:::SA237 effects on dams, embryo-fetal development, parturition and postnatal development were investigated in an enhanced pre- and postnatal development study, in which SA237 was subcutaneously administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels of 2 or 50 mg/kg once weekly from gestation day 20 until parturition. Infant development, including immune function and learning ability tests, was comprehensively assessed at multiple examinations until approximately 10 months after birth.
2:::In 336 INMA children, relative placental mtDNA content was measured. Land-use regression models were used to estimate prenatal NO2 exposure. Infant growth (height and weight) was assessed at birth, at 6 months of age, and at 1 year of age. We used multiple linear regression models and performed mediation analyses. The proportion of mediation was calculated as the ratio of indirect effect to total effect.
2:::Thermic cauterization of episcleral veins was utilized to elevate the intraocular pressure in Sprague Dawley rats. Morphological changes were surveyed on a cellular level with a staining of Brn3a-positive cells. The retinal nerve fiber layer was investigated using optical coherence tomography (OCT, Heidelberg Engineering) and the optic nerve was analyzed by an axonal grading system.

Herein, the literature related to chemical constituents and pharmacological activities were searched in November 2016.
2:::Requirements engineering activities for software systems follow traditional software requirements elicitation methods, general software requirements specification (SRS) templates, and standards. We performed a multistep procedure to develop a specific evidence-based CIPROS checklist: (1) A systematic literature review to build a comprehensive collection of technical concepts, (2) a qualitative content analysis to define a catalogue of relevant criteria, and (3) a checklist to construct a minimal appraisal standard.
2:::1064 subjects with T1D/T2D and documented degludec use from the Diabetes-Patient-Follow-Up (DPV) registry were included. The follow-up cohort (n=421) comprised patients with available data before and 3-15months after switching to degludec. A t-test for paired values was implemented to compare rates of severe hypoglycaemia, and mean values for HbA1C, BMI, basal insulin dose/kg bodyweight/day, and the number of basal insulin injections/day before and after switching to degludec Results were stratified by type of diabetes. In T1D, subgroup analyses were conducted (age, sex, basal insulin used before switching). P<0.05 was considered significant.
2:::Seventy-three consecutive patients with TIA underwent DWI on admission (initial DWI) and at 24 hours after admission (second DWI). Patients were divided into 2 groups based on initial DWI findings in relation to the second examination: false negative (group 1) and other (group 2). The probability of initial false-negative findings was determined for each hour from TIA onset to initial DWI. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the independent risk factors associated with false-negative findings on initial DWI.
2:::Patients were referred by physicians, and standardized forms were used to gather demographic, clinical, and laboratory data.
2:::Between 2012 and 2014, we prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with ischemic stroke and calculated infarct volume. Outcome scores at 3 months included modified Rankin Scale and Neuro-Quality of Life T scores. We evaluated whether volume organized by quartiles predicted modified Rankin Scale and HRQOL scores at 3 months using logistic and linear regression as appropriate, adjusting for relevant covariates. We calculated variance accounted for (R(2)) overall and by volume for each domain of HRQOL.
2:::Ninety-eight bladder cancer patients underwent MRI at two institutions. Standardized tumor ADC (sT-ADC) was calculated by dividing absolute tumor ADC (aT-ADC) by that of gluteus maximus. We compared ADCs between MRI protocols according to grade and T-stage.
2:::We conducted a single-center retrospective review of consecutive patients transferred to our facility for consideration of endovascular therapy. Patients were identified as admitted directly to the neuroangiography suite (DAN), transferred to the ED before intra-arterial therapy (ED-IA), and transferred to the ED but did not receive IA therapy (ED-IV).
2:::Data was collected from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database. We analyzed the prescription rates of psychotropic medications including antidepressants, anxiolytics, and sedatives/hypnotics, and investigated whether the time-series pattern of monthly prescriptions per 100,000 people was different in Ansan Danwon compared to that in Cheonan city after the Sewol Ferry disaster through difference-in-differences regression analysis.
2:::Data were abstracted from client records for participants (N=445) who met DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence and sought treatment at one of Behavioral Health Leadership Institutes two community-based recovery programs in Baltimore City from 2010 to 2015. Logistic regression estimated the odds ratios of treatment success (defined as retention in treatment for ≥90days) by sociodemographic predictors including age, race, gender, housing, legal issues and incarceration.'
2:::All consecutive patients treated with ECMO for refractory ARDS, regardless of cause, in the Caen University Hospital in northwestern France over the last decade were included in a retrospective cohort study. The receiver operating characteristic curves of each score were plotted, and the area under the curve was computed to assess their performance in predicting mortality (c-index).
2:::Chemo-naïve patients with histologically proven unresectable GBC were enrolled in this study. The patients received gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2)) and cisplatin (25 mg/m(2)) on days 1 and 8, every 21 days. A response assessment was done by CT scan every 4 weeks. The primary end points were to determine the response rates [RR; complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] and the disease control rate [DCR; CR + PR + stable disease (SD)]. The secondary end points were to evaluate toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).
2:::Patients who underwent mastectomy more than 5years ago complicated by upper extremity lymphedema for more than 1year were included. The enrolled patients were divided into an FIR treatment group and a control group (conservative treatment using bandage compression). Outcome measures included tumor markers (CA153, CA125), ultrasonography of relevant structures and monitoring for adverse reactions 1year after treatment. For the in vitro part of the study, the effects of FIR on human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB231) compared to the effects of FIR on human dermal fibroblasts as a control were considered. The viability, proliferation, cell cycle and apoptotic statistics of the adenocarcinoma and human dermal fibroblast cell lines were analyzed and compared.
2:::We did two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 studies at 12 community sites in Australia, New Zealand, and the USA, in HLA-DQ2·5-positive patients aged 18-70 years who had coeliac disease and were on a gluten-free diet. In the screening period for ascending dose cohorts, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by central randomisation with a simple block method to a double-blind crossover, placebo-controlled oral gluten challenge. Participants with a negative interferon γ release assay to Nexvax2 peptides after the screening oral gluten challenge were discontinued before dosing. For the biopsy cohorts, the screening period included an endoscopy, and participants with duodenal histology who had a Marsh score of greater than 1 were discontinued before dosing. Participants were subsequently randomly assigned to either Nexvax2 or placebo in ascending dose cohorts (2:1) and in biopsy cohorts (1:1) by central randomisation with a simple block method. In the three-dose study, participants received either Nexvax2 60 μg, 90 μg, or 150 μg weekly, or placebo over 15 days; in a fourth biopsy cohort, patients received either Nexvax2 at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or placebo. In the 16-dose study, participants received Nexvax2 150 μg or 300 μg or placebo twice weekly over 53 days; in a third biopsy cohort, patients also received either Nexvax2 at the MTD or placebo. In the 4-week post-treatment period, ascending dose cohorts underwent a further double-blind crossover, placebo-controlled oral gluten challenge, which had a fixed sequence, and biopsy cohorts had a gastroscopy with duodenal biopsies and quantitative histology within 2 weeks without oral gluten challenge. Participants, investigators, and study staff were masked to the treatment assignment, except for the study pharmacist. The primary endpoint was the number and percentage of adverse events in the treatment period in an intention-to-treat analysis. Both trials were completed and closed before data analysis. Trials were registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, numbers ACTRN12612000355875 and ACTRN12613001331729.

2:::A retrospective database analysis was conducted using a historical cohort design and including data collected between 2007 and 2013. Claims data were used to identify Medicare Advantage patients aged ≥65 years newly initiated on antimuscarinic OAB treatment. Patients were classified with potentially inappropriate use of antimuscarinic OAB drugs based on either the 2012 Beers Criteria or the 2015 Beers Criteria. Prevalence of PIM at the time of antimuscarinic initiation was determined. Bivariate comparisons of healthcare costs and medical condition burden were conducted to compare the marginal groups of patients (who qualified based on the 2012 Beers Criteria only or the 2015 Beers Criteria only). Differences in healthcare costs for patients with and without potentially inappropriate use of urinary antimuscarinics based on the 2012 and 2015 Beers Criteria were also examined.

2:::Fifty-three patients with BAV (mean age, 54 ± 14 years; 74% men) who underwent both TTE and CTA imaging for ascending aortic assessment were retrospectively identified. All studies were measured de novo by experts. TTE measurements were obtained at the sinuses and the Asc-Ao, at both systole and end-diastole, using both leading edge-to-leading edge (L-L) and inner edge-to-inner edge (I-I) methods in the parasternal long-axis (LAX) view. The sinuses were also measured in the parasternal short-axis (SAX) view using the same methods plus mid-diastole. CTA measurements were obtained in diastole using outer wall-to-outer wall (O-O) and inner wall-to-inner wall (I-I) methods. Correlation and agreement between the two imaging modalities were assessed using Lin correlation and Bland-Altman analysis, respectively.
2:::Among 224 pregnant women, we quantified concentrations of six nonspecific dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites of organophosphate insecticides in two urine samples collected at ~16 and ~26 weeks gestation. When children were eight years old, we administered the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a continuous measure of various dimensions of interpersonal behavior, communication, and repetitive/stereotypic behaviors. We estimated the association between a 10-fold increase in the sum of six DAP concentrations (ΣDAP) and SRS scores. We examined whether child PON1192 and PON1-108 genotypes modified this association.

2:::Retrospective, single-institution study of all patients 18 years or younger undergoing an initial evaluation for chest pain by a pediatric cardiologist (2014-15). We categorized the appropriateness of indications for echocardiograms on the basis of the AUC. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine factors associated with performance of an echocardiogram with the ""rarely appropriate"" indication. Excess costs associated with nondiagnostic echocardiograms meeting the ""rarely appropriate"" criteria were estimated using the Healthcare Bluebook to estimate a fair market price.
2:::Tissue microarrays from patients with gastric cancer were created from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded resection specimens. Tryptase density was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and the association between tryptase expression and prognosis was evaluated. Semiquantitative scoring was devised to determine an optimal cut-off value that correlated with survival. A prognostic nomogram was then developed incorporating tryptase expression scores along with other variables known to be related to survival.

2:::The pelvic organs from ten fresh male cadavers were removed and serial sectioned en bloc for histological investigation. The macroslices was divided into four sectors. Each sector was centrally covered with a raster dividing each sector in three subsectors numbered clockwise. The prostatic capsule was identified, and distances of 2.5 and 5 mm from the prostate were demarked with lines. We quantified the number of nerve fibers present in each subsector of each slide and recorded their position relative to the prostatic capsule.
2:::Radium-224, the generator radionuclide of (212)Pb, was extracted from its parent nuclide, (228)Th. Lead-212-labeling of the TCMC-chelator conjugated monoclonal antibody trastuzumab was carried out in a solution containing (224)Ra in equilibrium with progeny. Subsequently, the efficiency of separating the (212)Pb-radioimmunoconjugate from (224)Ra and other unconjugated daughter nuclides in the solution using either centrifugal separation or a PD-10 desalting size exclusion column was evaluated and compared.
2:::Thirty one stable patients with AKI, treated with CRRT, were included in the study. Blood, plasma and effluent samples were taken at the start of the study and 36 ± 12 h later. A group of 48 healthy volunteers were included as controls and exposed to one fasting blood sample.

2:::Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Cerebral ischemia outcome, TUNEL staining, Fluoro-Jade B staining were carried out 24 hours poststroke. The autophagic/lysosomal-related proteins were measured.
2:::Fifty-five F-florbetapir PET scans were evaluated by 3 experienced raters. Scans were first visually interpreted as having ""elevated"" or ""nonelevated"" plaque burden (""Visual Read""). Images were then processed using a standardized quantitative analysis software (MIMneuro) to generate whole brain and region of interest SUV ratios. This ""Quantitative Read"" was considered elevated if at least 2 of 6 regions of interest had an SUV ratio of more than 1.1. The final interpretation combined both visual and quantitative data together (""VisQ Read""). Cohen kappa values were assessed as a measure of interpretation agreement.

Public health control measures were applied simultaneously, including the isolation of patients and possible cases, personal protection and hygiene, and social distancing measures. Symptom surveillance of all participants was initiated, and the actual attack rate was calculated. For comparison, the theoretical attack rate for this outbreak was projected using the Newton-Raphson numerical method.
2:::Consecutive patients transferred from 3 high-volume PSCs to a single comprehensive stroke center between January 2015 and August 2016 were included in a retrospective study. Factors associated with key time metrics were analyzed with emphasis on PSC intrahospital workflow.
2:::Three thousand one hundred fifty-eight community-dwelling Chinese older adults in the Greater Chicago Area were surveyed. Independent variables included both self-reported and performance-based PF measurements. Dependent variable was EM, assessed by a 10-item instrument that has been widely used in social studies.
2:::Cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were used in this study. Mfn2 expression in cardiomyocytes was determined after the cardiomyocytes were challenged with DOX. Cardiomyocyte mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed with mitochondrial fragmentation and MitoSOX fluorescence probe, respectively. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was determined with caspase3 activity and TUNEL staining.
2:::The study is based on a longitudinal cohort design. We followed 2,713 U.S. Chinese older adults who agreed to participate in the study within 2011 to 2015. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data regarding the 2-year incidence of EA and its subtypes. We employed multiple logistic regression analyses to examine the associations between the sociodemographic characteristics and incident EA.
2:::We did this randomised controlled trial at four National Health Service primary child and mental health services in Oxfordshire, UK. Children aged 5-12 years referred for anxiety difficulties were randomly allocated (1:1), via a secure online minimisation tool, to receive brief guided parent-delivered CBT or solution-focused brief therapy, with minimisation for age, sex, anxiety severity, and level of parental anxiety. The allocation sequence was not accessible to the researcher enrolling participants or to study assessors. Research staff who obtained outcome measurements were masked to group allocation and clinical staff who delivered the intervention did not measure outcomes. The primary outcome was recovery, on the basis of Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement (CGI-I). Parents recorded patient-level resource use. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for use in cost-utility analysis were derived from the Child Health Utility 9D. Assessments were done at baseline (before randomisation), after treatment (primary endpoint), and 6 months after treatment completion. We did analysis by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the ISCRTN registry, number ISRCTN07627865.
2:::Data were collected through the Population Study of Chinese Elderly (PINE), a longitudinal cohort study of Chinese older adults in the greater Chicago area. A total of 2,713 Chinese older adults completed both waves of data collection. TIP was measured through the Trust in Physician scale from Anderson and Dedrick (Anderson LA, Dedrick RF. Development of the Trust in Physician scale: a measure to assess interpersonal trust in patient-physician relationships. Psychol Rep. 1990;67(3 Pt 2):1091-1100. doi:10.2466/pr0.1990.67.3f.1091) (range: 11-55). Depressive symptoms were measured through Patient Health Questionnaire-9.
2:::Sixteen patients with NPDR without macular edema underwent SDOCT and OCTA. To compare MAs seen on OCTA with those on SDOCT, we superimposed the OCTA superficial capillary plexus (SCP) vascular landmarks onto those of the near infrared. Two observers masked to patient groupings evaluated reflectivity of MAs on SDOCT scans, graded as hyporeflective, moderate, or hyperreflective, and their visualization at the level of SCP and deep capillary plexus (DCP) on OCTA.
2:::Data were derived from the Population Study of Chinese Elderly (PINE) at two time points: 2011-2013 and 2013-2015. Physical function was measured by observed physical performance testing, including chair stand, tandem stand, and timed walk. Mixed-effect models were used to analyze the demographic risk factors associated with physical function decline.
2:::Between September 2011 and February 2014, 126 pediatric cancer patients were admitted to our center for chemotherapy and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and were included in this study. Retrospective and prospective data collection were performed before and after antibiotic cycling, respectively. Between September 2011 and November 2012 (before antibiotic cycling was implemented), intravenous cefpirome was used as the empirical therapy for FN. Between December 2012 and February 2014 (after antibiotic cycling was implemented), the monthly antibiotic cycling involved intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam (PIPC/TAZ), intravenous meropenem or ciprofloxacin (CPFX), and intravenous cefepime in that order. For children aged ≥13 years, the monthly cycling involved intravenous PIPC/TAZ, and CPFX was administered.
2:::Data were drawn from the Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago. Social supports were measured by asking the frequency of receipt of support from spouse, non-spouse family members, and friends. Use of cancer screenings were evaluated by asking the history of utilization of colon, breast, cervical, and prostate cancer screenings.
2:::The gene expression profile of GSE29859, including 4 cortical bone marrow samples with excessive doses of Vitamin A and 4 control cortical bone marrow samples, was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DGEs) between cortical bone marrow samples and control samples were screened out and pathway enrichment analysis was undertaken. Based on the MSigDB database, the potential regulatory transcription factors (TFs) were identified.
2:::A series of reduced acquisition time SPECT scans were reconstructed retrospectively and reviewed to establish optimal reconstruction parameters. Twenty patients referred for evaluation of bone metastases underwent planar imaging, followed by half-body SPECT, reconstructed using the optimized parameters. SPECT and planar images were reported by an experienced radiologist, who reviewed image quality and recorded the number of lesions observed, their location, clinical significance and reporter confidence.
2:::SLIMMER was a randomised controlled intervention, carried out in a real-world setting, targeting 40- to 70-year-old adults at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (n=316). The intervention group participated in a 10-month combined dietary and physical activity programme. Measurements were carried out at baseline, 12months, and 18months. Effectiveness was determined for fasting insulin, HbA1c, weight, BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-height-ratio. Differences between the low SES (no, primary, or lower secondary school) and higher SES group were tested using logistic regression and ANCOVA.
2:::From 1998-2011, 60 patients were treated - N1: 18%, N2: 75% and N3: 7%. 82% underwent neck dissection. 55% received IMRT and 62% underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
2:::We conducted a systematic literature search on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library using the primary keywords ""vonoprazan,"" ""takecab"", ""TAK-438,"" ""potassium,"" ""competitive,"" ""potassium-competitive,"" ""Helicobacter,"" and ""pylori."" Studies were included if they evaluated the eradication rate between the vonoprazan-based and proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapies.
2:::Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, 5969 borderline patients aged 18 years and older and 23,876 age-and sex-matched controls were enrolled between 2002 and 2009, and followed up to the end of 2011 to identify the development of stroke.
2:::The seizure prediction system was developed based on the extraction of correlation dimension, correlation entropy, noise level, Lempel-Ziv complexity, largest Lyapunov exponent, and nonlinear interdependence from segments of intracranial EEG.
2:::We searched MEDLINE®, EMBASE™, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies of higher vs lower blood pressure targets for vasopressor therapy in critically ill hypotensive adult patients. Two reviewers independently assessed trial eligibility based on titles and abstracts, and they then selected full-text reports. Outcomes, subgroups, and analyses were prespecified. We used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to rate the overall confidence in the estimates of intervention effects.
2:::[(11)C]1, its fluoralkyl analogue [(18)F]PK209 ([(18)F]2) and the newly synthesized fluorovinyloxy analogue [(11)C]7b were evaluated ex vivo in male Wistar rats for metabolic stability. In addition, [(11)C]7b was subjected to a biodistribution study and its affinity (Ki) and lipophilicity (logD7.4) values were determined.
2:::Pigs were anesthetized, and heterogeneous acute lung injury (ALI) was created by Tween instillation via a bronchoscope to both diaphragmatic lung lobes. Tissue in all other lobes was normal. Airway pressure release ventilation was used to precisely regulate time and pressure at both inspiration and expiration. Animals were separated into two groups: (1) over-distension + high dynamic strain (OD + HDS, n = 6) and (2) over-distension + low dynamic strain (OD + LDS, n = 6). OD was caused by setting the inspiratory pressure at 40 cmH2O and dynamic strain was modified by changing the expiratory duration, which varied the tidal volume. Animals were ventilated for 6 h recording hemodynamics, lung function, and inflammatory mediators followed by an extensive necropsy.
2:::In 2013, we purchased on the Internet 18 models from 11 brands of e-liquids. We purchased a second sample of the same models 4months later. We analyzed their content in nicotine, anabasine, propylene glycol, glycerol, ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, and tested their pH.
2:::We used data from recent systematic reviews of interventions for somatoform disorders to address three questions: We described outcome domains and measures by compiling forest plots of standardised mean difference. We examined the association of changes in outcome between short and long-term and between different outcome domains by non-parametric correlation.
2:::An adapted version of the explanatory sequential mixed methods design was applied. We used data from an on-going pilot study on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction. Negative effects were measured by Inventory for the assessment of Negative Effects of Psychotherapy (INEP). In addition, telephone interviews were conducted with randomly chosen patients and patients who reported negative effects. The latter were asked to elaborate on their INEP response. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively while interview transcripts were explored by thematic analysis.
2:::Subject-specific neuromuscular characteristics of the biceps and triceps brachii were evaluated using robot-measured kinetics, kinematics and EMG activity as inputs to a musculoskeletal model.
2:::Cross-sectional data were collected from patients visiting a specialized outpatient clinic. Frequencies of mental disorders were investigated using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID-I) and compared to the general population. Furthermore, self-rating questionnaires were used to assess somatic symptom severity (PHQ-15), depression severity (PHQ-9) and anxiety severity (GAD-7).
2:::Four databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science and Cochrane Library) were searched for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effectiveness of alternative modes of MI (other than face-to-face individual counseling) in preventing and treating substance abuse. Eligible studies were rated on methodological quality and their findings were qualitatively synthesized.
2:::Nine female OCP users and 9 female non-users participated in the investigation. Combining dynamometry, electromyography and ultrasonography, patella tendon properties and vastus lateralis architectural properties were measured pre and during the first of 6 sets of 12 maximal voluntary eccentric knee extensions. Serum oestrogen levels were measured on the 7th day of the pill cycle and the 14th day of menstrual cycle in OCP users and non-users, respectively. Maximal voluntary isometric knee extension torque loss, creatine kinase and muscle soreness were measured 48 h pre-damage, post-damage, and 48, 96 and 168 h post-damage.
2:::Fibromyalgia patients (N=153; 135 women) followed a multidisciplinary group program spanning 12weeks, aimed at ""regaining control over daily functioning"". Anxiety, depression, pain coping and kinesiophobia were used as predictor variables. Outcome variables were pain severity, pain-related disability, physical functioning and functional interference. All variables were assessed at 3 moments: on the first and last day of treatment, and 12weeks after the last day of treatment. Overall treatment effects were analyzed using mixed model analyses. Latent class growth analysis identifying different treatment trajectory classes was used to investigate individual differences in treatment effects. Finally, cross-lagged structural equation models were used to investigate the dynamic interplay between predictors and outcomes over time.
2:::Young and healthy participants were recruited on campus, and 27 AA and 27 NHW adults completed this study. Central pain inhibitory processing was assessed using conditioned pain modulation (CPM), where changes in electrical pain ratings were quantified during and after exposure to pressure pain compared to baseline. PA levels were assessed using self-report questionnaires and accelerometer.
2:::Graded-exercise tests performed by 12 men (age: 21 ± 2 years; BMI: 24 ± 3 kg/m(2)) initially established that peak oxygen uptake ([Formula: see text]; 76 ± 8.4%), expired ventilation ([Formula: see text]; 71 ± 6.8%), carbon dioxide production ([Formula: see text]; 71 ± 6.8%), heart rate (HRpeak; 91 ± 5.3%), and power output (PPO; 56 ± 3.6%) were lower during single-leg compared to double-leg cycling (main effect of mode; p < 0.05). On separate days, participants performed four experimental trials, which involved 30-min bouts of either continuous (50% PPO) or interval exercise [4 × (5-min 65% PPO + 2.5 min 20% PPO)] in a single- or double-leg manner.
2:::Data was examined from a prospective study of OEF/OIF soldiers assessed before and one year after deployment (n=336). Physical symptom burden was measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15). Analyses were conducted with polynomial regression and response surface analysis (RSA).
2:::We prospectively enrolled a cohort of 45 critically ill patients with type 2 diabetes managed according to a liberal glucose protocol (target blood glucose 10-14 mmol/l). We recorded the administration of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents and measured plasma c-peptide as surrogate marker of endogenous insulin secretion on the first two consecutive days in ICU.
2:::Data on hip fractures was obtained from the medical claims database of Estonian Health Insurance Fund (EHIF). Consumption and price data was obtained from the Estonian State Agency of Medicines (SAM).Consumption is presented using WHO defined daily doses methodology, and the prices reflect the average wholesale price of medicines.
2:::750 men and women ages 18-39 with multidrug use and heterosexual behavior were randomized in equal proportions to the three conditions. Instrumentation included well-tested measures of drug use, risky sex, mental distress and substance dependence.
2:::This was a prospective observational study performed in a prehospital setting. Data from the Emergency Medical Service in Hamburg (Germany) and data from the local weather station were evaluated over a 5-year period. Lowess-regression analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between ambient temperature and frequency of severe hypoglycemia. Additionally, three temperature-ranges were defined in order to compare them with each other with regard to frequency of severe hypoglycemia (<10°C vs. 10-20°C vs. >20°C).
2:::Retrospective review of 37 CF patients treated for M. abscessus respiratory infection at a single center from 2006 to 2014. Outcomes included change in FEV1 at 30, 60, 90, 180, and 365days after treatment and clearance of M. abscessus from sputum cultures.
2:::Secondary VA clinical and administrative data from the electronic medical record (EMR) were used to identify all positive alcohol screens (AUDIT-C score≥5) documented among PLWH (10/01/09-5/30/13) followed by another alcohol screen documented 9-15months later. Unadjusted and adjusted Poisson regression models assessed the association between brief intervention (advice to reduce drinking or abstain documented in EMR) and resolution of unhealthy alcohol use (follow-up AUDIT-C<5 with ≥2 point reduction).
2:::Female mice were ovx or sham operated. After three weeks, either dorsal air pouches were established by injections of sterile air with subsequent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, or LPS was injected intra-peritoneally (i.p). Mice received daily injections with E2 or vehicle for three days before challenge. 6 hours after challenge in the air pouch, blood cells were counted, leukocytes from the pouch were analyzed by flow cytometry, and cytometric bead array or ELISA were used to quantify cytokines collected from the air pouch. Blood cells were counted 1h after i.p challenge.
2:::The sample comprised data from 602 Canadian and Danish school-aged children (Mage=10.54, SD=0.99; 52.5% girls). Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to test 3-, modified 3-, and 4-factor models in both samples. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test factor structure invariance across boys and girls in a combined sample. Differential Item Functioning (DIF) was assessed using test characteristic curves.
2:::School-level, aggregated panel design using data from the National Drug Surveys among Secondary Students from 2005 to 2015 for students in grades 9-12. We used a fixed-effects difference-in-difference model to estimate the effect of school occupations on prevalence of self-reported indicators of drug use.
2:::RAS blocker prescriptions, issued between 01/01/2009-30/06/2015, were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to estimate the quarterly prevalence (number of patients with at least one co-prescription) and incidence (number of patients first receiving a RAS blocker co-prescription) of co-prescribing. Two different RAS blockers prescribed on the same day constituted a co-prescription.
2:::Lp(a) was measured in 14,154 ARIC participants without prevalent HF at ARIC visit 1 (1987-1989). The association of Lp(a) quintiles with incident HF hospitalization was assessed using Cox proportional-hazards models. Arterial stiffness parameters were stratified based on Lp(a) quintiles, and p-trend was calculated across ordered groups.
2:::We reviewed the cases of patients younger than 50 years of age with elevated PSA concentration (>4.0 ng/mL), who received 12 cores TRUSP biopsies at TPEVGH from January 2008-December 2013. The age, family history, digital rectal examination (DRE) results, PSA concentration, free/total PSA ratio, total prostate volume, PSA density, lower urinary tract symptoms and complications after the procedure were reviewed. The pathologic findings of TRUSP biopsy and clinical follow-up were reviewed and analyzed according to the Epstein criteria.
2:::The final models were derived with bootstrapped replications of backward stepwise logistic regressions on each outcome. Odds ratios and index weights were generated for each Elixhauser comorbidity to create a single index score per record for mortality and readmissions. Model validation was conducted with c-statistics.
2:::Consecutive ambulatory subjects were prospectively recruited and completed the validated Medication Adherence Reporting Scale (MARS), with the primary outcome being adherence differences between group age-matched TR and YA groups. Pediatric subjects were taken as the control group. Perceptions of medication-related necessity and concerns were assessed with the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ). Nonadherers (defined as MARS ≤16) received the Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Pharmacist Adherence Counselling (IPAC) intervention and adherence change was reassessed after 6 months as a secondary outcome.
2:::The proposed test bed system is based on the following guidelines: (1) use of open source databases to enable experimental replication; (2) use of real ECG signals and physiological noise; (3) inclusion of randomized TWA episodes. Both sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) are separately analyzed. Also a nonparametric hypothesis test, based on Bootstrap resampling, is used to determine whether the presence of the EMD block actually improves the performance.
2:::A retrospective study was performed on 25 consecutive CI recipients with a median CI use experience of 10 years who came for their annual CI follow-up fitting session. All subjects were assessed by means of speech audiometry with open set monosyllables at 40, 55, 70, and 85 dB SPL in quiet with their home MAP. Other psychoacoustic tests were executed depending on the audiologists clinical judgment. The home MAP and the corresponding test results were entered into FOX. If FOX suggested to make MAP changes, they were implemented and another speech audiometry was performed with the new MAP.'
2:::The developed CAD system includes different user-friendly tools for segmenting and determining whole brain and brain structure volumes in an easy and accurate way. Specifically, three types of measurements can be performed: (1) total volume of white, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid; (2) brain structure volumes (volume of putamen, thalamus, hippocampus and caudate nucleus); and (3) brain lesion volumes.
2:::Twenty patients (20 ears) who underwent surgery for middle ear disease (n = 20) and 10 healthy controls (10 ears) were enrolled in the hospital. Computed tomography (CT) and pure tone audiometry were performed before and after surgery. A finite element model was developed using CT scans, and correlation analysis was conducted between stapes displacement and surgical methods. An audiometric test was also performed for 14 patients before and after surgery.
2:::An end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with various dialysis conditions was modeled through a classic variable-volume two-compartment kinetic model to simulate an anuric patient, and GA was implemented to search for an optimal HD schedule for each individual considering and ignoring burden consumption of each dialysis session. The adequacy of the optimized HD schedules through GA was assessed with time average concentration (TAC) and time average deviation (TAD).
2:::In this paper, two energy functional items based on specific visual characteristics of ME-NBI images have been integrated in the framework of Chan-Vese model to construct the Hue-texture-embedded model. On the one hand, a global hue energy functional was proposed representing a global color information extracted in H channel (HSI color space). On the other hand, a texture energy was put forward presenting local microvascular textures extracted by the PIF of adaptive threshold in S channel.
2:::Eight- to 10-week-old BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally sensitized and intragastrically challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). Different groups of mice were administered either an anti-CCR3 antibody or a control IgG by intraperitoneal injection 1 hour before each OVA challenge. Eosinophilic inflammation in the intestinal mucosa, mucosal injury, and severity of diarrhea were compared between different groups at 1 hour after final OVA challenge.
2:::Data were collected from the Cancer Registry of Crete in Greece (counties of Rethymno and Lasithi) for the period 1998-2004. Data collection was performed on paper forms and manually transcribed to a single data file, thus introducing errors and noise (e.g. missing and erroneous values, duplicate entries etc.). Data were pre-processed and prepared for analysis using data mining tools and algorithms. Feature selection was applied to evaluate the contribution of each collected feature in predicting patients survival. Several classifiers were trained and evaluated for their ability to predict survival of patients. Finally, statistical analysis of cancer morbidity and mortality rates in the two regions was performed in order to validate the initial findings.'
2:::58 patients underwent BFTOA, of these 48 were available for follow up. The allograft was prepared with the help of specifically designed jigs and the surgery was performed using either a lateral or a direct anterior approach. Patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically preoperatively, and at a mean 121±18months of follow-up.
2:::Clinical specimens (n = 525) obtained from patients presenting at a tertiary care hospital of South India with clinical symptoms suggestive of community-acquired pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infections, superficial or internal abscesses, chronic skin ulcers and bone or joint infections were tested for the presence of Burkholderia pseudomallei using conventional culture (CC), enrichment culture (EC) and PCR. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of CC and PCR were initially deduced using EC as the gold standard method. Further, diagnostic accuracies of all the three methods were analysed using Bayesian latent class modelling (BLCM).
2:::A total of 250 patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia admitted to a single tertiary hospital were enrolled in this study. Detection of MRMP was based on specific point mutations in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. The medical records of enrolled patients were reviewed retrospectively, and the clinical courses and laboratory data were compared.
2:::The cohort consisted of 309,825 women with a birth of at least 1 live newborn between January 01, 2005 and September 30, 2014, resulting in 469,150 birth events and 477,089 live newborns. A modified PPCM definition was used, allowing from 32 weeks gestation and up to 6 months postpartum. Women were categorized according to DM status.'
2:::Monomers 1-9 were tested as potential HEMA substitutes. Methacrylates 4, 5 and 6 and (N-methyl)acrylamides 7-9 were synthesized and characterized by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. The reactivity of each monomer was studied using photo-DSC. Mixtures of monomers 1-9 with the urethane dimethacrylate UDMA (1/1: wt/wt) were formulated and cured. The water sorption and solubility of these materials were determined according to ISO 4049. Luting composites based on monomers 1-9 or on HEMA were formulated. The flexural strength and modulus of elasticity were measured using a three-point bending setup, according to ISO 4049. Self-etch adhesives containing monomers 1-9 or HEMA were prepared and used to mediate a bond between the dental composite Tetric EvoCeram(®) and both dentin and enamel. The shear bond strength (SBS) was measured using a Zwick universal testing machine.
2:::To identify children with FA, a primary survey was conducted via a questionnaire with all children aged 0-18 years in Niijima village (remote islands of Japan). In the secondary survey, a detailed medical interview was conducted by doctors with children who currently did not eat some foods. The third survey involved serum food-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) tests and an OFC for children with suspected FA.
2:::Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to SAH by endovascular perforation. Distribution of SAH was defined by T2*-weighted images within 1h after SAH. Prevalence and location of acute infarction were assessed by diffusion-weighted MR images on day 1 after the induction.
2:::A cohort of 1066 Scottish men and women aged 60-74 years with type 2 diabetes from the Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study were followed up for a median of 6.7 years. New-onset reduced renal function was defined as two eGFRs <60 ml(-1) min(-1) (1.73 m)(-2) at least 3 months apart with a > 25% decline from baseline eGFR. Ankle brachial pressure index (ABI), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) were measured at baseline. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid intima media thickness were measured 1 year into follow-up. Data were analysed using Cox proportional hazards models.
2:::We systematically searched Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant studies published before August 25, 2016. Data was extracted by two independent reviewers. The main outcomes included glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin dose, weight, hypoglycemia, ketosis and ketoacidosis. All pooled data were assessed using random-effects model.
2:::We combined the fourth and fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data collected from 2007 to 2012 and analyzed 2,015 children at 1 to 3 years old. Regression analysis was used to determine the association of the following variables: AD, feeding types, duration of breast-feeding, and others.
2:::TK from the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrTK) was recombinantly produced and purified to homogeneity. Biochemical properties of the CrTK enzyme were delineated by activity assays and its structural features determined by CD analysis and X-ray crystallography.
2:::We analysed data of all HIV-infected patients older than 16 years who attended Newlands Clinic between March 1, 2004 and April 29, 2015. The clinic considers patients whose random blood sugar is higher than 11.1 mmol/l and which is confirmed by a fasting blood sugar higher than 7.0 mmol/l to have T2DM. T2DM is also diagnosed in symptomatic patients who have a RBS >11.0 mmol/l. Risk factors for developing T2DM were identified using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for confounding. Missing baseline BMI data were multiply imputed. Results are presented as adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
2:::Sixteen patients of varying refractive errors and normal corneal curvatures (measured with Pentacam(™) Oculus) were fitted with trial Mini-Scleral Design (MSD) scleral lenses (15.8 mm diameter) in one eye. The sagittal depths of the scleral lenses were selected by adding 350 μm to the corneal sagittal heights measured at a chord length of 15 mm with the Visante(™) optical coherence tomographer (OCT) anterior segment scans and picking the closest available trial lens in the set. Initial measurements were taken 30 min after lens insertion and included an auto-refraction, subjective refraction, and best sphere refraction over the contact lens. Visual acuities and Visante(™) OCT anterior segment scans were also taken. These measurements were repeated after 6-8 h of lens wear.
2:::Pregnant rats were administered streptozotocin to induce diabetes. The RBP4 and retinol levels were evaluated in GDM and normal pregnant rats. After then, normal pregnant rats were divided into two groups to receive either apo-RBP4 or vehicle injection. The metabolic parameters and insulin signaling in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver were determined in apo-RBP4 and control groups. Primary human adipocytes were cultured in vitro with different proportions of apo-RBP4 and holo-RBP4 for 24 h. The interaction between RBP4 and STRA6 was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation, and the expression of JAK-STAT pathway and insulin signaling were detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence.
2:::A meta-analysis was performed of nine eligible studies regarding the effect of moxifloxacin plus the recommended regimen compared to the recommended regimen alone for the treatment of TB.
2:::This study of 4,464 children was embedded in a population-based prospective cohort study. Information on breastfeeding was obtained by multiple questionnaires from birth until 1 year of age. At 10 years of age, lung function was measured by spirometry, and information on asthma was obtained by questionnaire. Adjusted linear and logistic regression models were used to examine the associations.
2:::Institutional approval was granted for The Vascular and Endovascular Research Network (VERN) to retrospectively collect data pertaining to cardiovascular risk reduction from four tertiary vascular units in England. Patients with small AAA (January 2013-December 2015) were included. Demographic details, postcode, current medications, and smoking status were recorded using a bespoke electronic database and analysed. In a secondary analysis VERN contacted all AAA screening units in England and Wales to assess their current protocols relating to CV protection.
2:::13 consecutive infants and children with diagnosis of isolated pulmonary sequestration (PS) had percutaneous closure of the aberrant artery supplying pulmonary sequestration between 2010 and 2015. By protocol, echocardiographic and chest-MRI assessment was performed before and respectively at 6-12months and 1year with the aim to study the effects of embolization on heart volume overload and regression of pulmonary sequestration.
2:::We tested the hypothesis that BMD of the total hip and femoral neck measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is inversely associated with prevalence of three echocardiographic measures of cardiac calcification in a cross-sectional analysis of 1497 older adults from the Cardiovascular Health Study. The adjusted association of BMD with aortic valve calcification (AVC), aortic annular calcification (AAC), and mitral annular calcification (MAC) was assessed with relative risk (RR) regression.
2:::Randomized controlled trials comparing alternative dressing materials, for post-operative management of wounds following TKA and THA were included in the review. Databases searched included the MEDLINE and the EMBASE from inception to February 2017. Two authors performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Where levels of clinical and statistical heterogeneity permitted, data were pooled for meta-analysis.
2:::This was an observational cross-sectional study on 8-15 years old migraine patients. Allodynia was assessed by a questionnaire. Pericranial tenderness and comorbidity for JFM as well as their possible association with poor quality of life and migraine related disability, and with other clinical symptoms as anxiety, depression, sleep disorders and pain catastrophizing, were also evaluated.
2:::MUNIX calculations were performed on the bicep brachii muscles of eight healthy subjects. Negative effect of suboptimal electrode positions on MUNIX accuracy was eliminated by employing the high-density surface electromyography technique. MUNIX procedures that utilized a variety of surface interferential pattern (SIP) epoch recruitment strategies (including the original MUNIX procedure, two proposed improvement strategies and their combinations) were described. For each MUNIX procedure, ten thousands of different SIP pools were constructed by randomly recruiting necessary SIP epochs from a large SIP epoch pool (3 datasets, 9 independent electromyography recordings at different contraction levels per dataset and 10 SIP epochs per recording) and implemented for MUNIX calculation. The repeatability of each MUNIX procedure was assessed by summarizing the resulting MUNIX distribution and compared to investigate the effect of SIP epoch selection strategy on repeatability performance.

Rats were killed after 14 days of obstruction. Histological changes and oxidative stress parameters were assessed. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry analysis were used to measure epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, including epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Collagen-I, and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). Proliferation and apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTEs) were also measured.
2:::We performed a prospective cohort study of individuals who underwent a screening colonoscopy within the National Colorectal Cancer Screening Program in Poland, from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008. We collected data from 146,860 colonoscopies performed by 294 endoscopists, with each endoscopist having participated at least twice in annual editions of primary colonoscopy screening. We used annual feedback and quality benchmark indicators to improve colonoscopy performance. We used ADR quintiles in the whole data set to categorize the annual ADRs for each endoscopist. An increased ADR was defined as an increase by at least 1 quintile category, or the maintenance of the highest category in subsequent screening years. Multivariate frailty models were used to evaluate the effects of increased ADR on the risk of interval colorectal cancer and death.
2:::The BOOG 2013-08 is a Dutch prospective non-inferiority randomized multicentre trial. Women with pathologically confirmed clinically node negative T1-2 invasive breast cancer undergoing breast conserving therapy will be randomized for sentinel lymph node biopsy versus no sentinel lymph node biopsy. Endpoints include regional recurrence after 5 (primary endpoint) and 10 years of follow-up, distant-disease free and overall survival, quality of life, morbidity and cost-effectiveness. Previous data indicate a 5-year regional recurrence free survival rate of 99% for the control arm and 96% for the study arm. In combination with a non-inferiority limit of 5% and probability of 0.8, this result in a sample size of 1.644 patients including a lost to follow-up rate of 10%. Primary and secondary endpoints will be reported after 5 and 10 years of follow-up.

Misoprostol (200 μg) was administered at 30 minutes, 90 minutes, and 4 hours after the first dose of nasal ketorolac. Measured end points included change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), peak nasal inspiratory flow rate (PNIF), number of treatments received for induced reactions, and adverse gastrointestinal effects.
2:::A retrospective review was performed for patients 55 years or older with a c-spine fracture during a 4-year study period. All patients had a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 and were considered asymptomatic if they did not complain of neck pain on initial presentation, denied tenderness to palpation of the c-spine on examination, and were without neurologic deficit. Differences between groups were assessed with Kruskal-Wallis and χ tests.
2:::Thirty-one patients with EOC underwent PET/CT for an early restaging after cytoreductive surgery, having been diagnosed with carcinomatosis (before chemotherapy). The SUVmax, MTV (cm(3); 42% threshold) and TLG (g) were registered on residual peritoneal lesions. The patients were followed up 20±12months thereafter. The PET/CT results were compared to overall survival (OS).
2:::We designed an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma-supported multicenter, prospective observational cohort study involving four Level I trauma centers throughout the United States. Screening occurred from March 2015 to April 2016. We performed universal screening of adult trauma patients using the validated HITS (Hurt, Insult, Threaten, Scream) and SAVE (sexual violence) screening surveys. Trauma recidivism, substance use, and mental illness were also measured and were classified as ""trauma-associated comorbidities."" Chi-squared test compared categorical variables with significance at p <0.05. Parametric data is presented as mean ± standard deviation.
2:::In this prospective, IRB-approved study, 40 PAD patients (30 male, mean age 72 years) underwent CTA on a dual-source CT scanner at 80kV tube voltage. The reference amplitude for tube current modulation was personalized based on the body mass index (BMI) with 120 mAs for [BMI≤25] or 150 mAs for [25<BMI≤30]. Iterative image reconstruction was applied. The presence of significant stenoses (>70%) was assessed by two readers independently and compared to subsequent DSA. Radiation exposure was assessed with the computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol) and the dosis-length product (DLP). Objective image quality was assessed via contrast- and signal-to-noise ratio (CNR and SNR) measurements. Radiation exposure and image quality were compared between the BMI groups and between the BMI-adjusted ultra-low-dose protocol and the low-dose institutional standard protocol (ISP).
2:::A retrospective analysis of the Department of Defense Trauma Registry was performed for all Role 2 (R2) and Role 3 (R3) military treatment facilities from January 2001 to May 2016. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes were grouped into 18 categories based on functional surgical skill sets. The 189,167 surgical procedures identified were stratified by role of care, month, and year. Percentiles were calculated for the number of procedures for each skill set. A literature search was performed for publications documenting combat surgical workload during the same period.
2:::We performed analyses nested in the Crohns and Colitis Foundation of America Partners cohort. We used bivariate analyses to compare demographics and medication use among patients with ulcerative colitis or indeterminate colitis and pouch-related symptoms and those with IPAA without symptoms. We also compared Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System domains (measured in T-scores) and short IBD questionnaire quality of life scales between symptomatic pouch patients (over the past 6 mo) and those without symptoms.'
2:::A retrospective trend analysis of the World Health Organization mortality database for mortality from all cancers, all CVDs, and their three most common types, by sex and age. Age-standardized mortality rates were adjusted to the 2013 European Standard Population and analyzed using joinpoint regression analysis for annual percent changes.
2:::TAVRs performed in 48 centers across France between January 2013 and December 2015 were prospectively included in the FRANCE TAVI (French Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) registry. Findings were further compared with those reported from the FRANCE 2 (French Aortic National CoreValve and Edwards 2) registry, which captured all TAVRs performed from January 2010 to January 2012 across 34 centers.
2:::The study population comprised 250 Israeli BC survivors, diagnosed with BC between 1999 and 2003, without evidence of disease after 8-12 years, and 250 women with no cancer history, individually matched to survivors by age and area of residence. Data collection and analysis were conducted during August 2012-June 2015 and included socio-demographic variables, lifestyle habits, health promotion by the family physician, and participation in screening procedures and prevention measures.
2:::Twelve 1-year cohorts who participated in a comprehensive employer-sponsored lifestyle intervention program targeting diet, exercise, behavior modification, and stress management between 2006 and 2010 at a rural university in Appalachian Ohio were studied. Body composition, fasting glucose and lipid levels, and maximal oxygen consumption were measured at baseline, after 100 days, and at 1 year. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were conducted to compare measures at baseline with measures at 100 days and at 1 year.
2:::Publications describing endovascular repair of the aortic arch (2000-2016) were systematically searched and reviewed.
2:::This work analyses the capacity of primary care systems to be responsive. Data collected from 32 PC systems were used to investigate whether a relationship exists between the responsiveness of PC systems and the PC doctor remuneration systems and domestic health expenditure.
2:::Gene expression data (GSE23160) in the cortex and the striatum of an intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion-I/R mouse model (N = 12) and sham controls (N = 4) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Limma package was used to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the I/R (2, 8, and 24 hours) and control groups. Correlation analysis was then performed to identify the highly correlated differentially expressed genes (HCDEGs). STRING and Cytoscape software were used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of HCDEGs. Furthermore, Venny 2.0 was used to identify common overlapped DEGs whose transcription factors (TFs) were predicted using iRegulon in Cytoscape.
2:::In this study, the following tests and surveys were applied: (i) QOL questionnaire [Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ)]; (ii) SS questionnaire (SSQ) [female sexual quotient (FSQ) and male sexual quotient (MSQ)]; (iii) 6-minute walk test (6MWT). Spearmans correlation was used for comparison between the data; the Mann-Whitney test was applied to analyze the difference between genders. A total of 52 adult patients with CF were included in this study.'
2:::In 2012 Christiana Care received a grant to design a generalizable, scalable, and replicable IT-driven care model that would integrate disparate clinical and registry data generated from routine care to support longitudinal care management for patients with ischemic heart disease. The single-disease care management program was expanded beginning in mid-2015 to serve risk-based models for many diseases and chronic conditions.
2:::The Birmingham Eye Trauma Terminology (BETT) system was used to classify injuries as globe ruptures, penetrating eye injuries (PEIs), intraocular foreign bodies (IOFBs) or perforating injuries. Demographic data, past ocular history, mechanism of trauma, ocular injuries, and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) before and after treatment were recorded.
2:::Included were randomised controlled trials and cohort studies comparing both techniques. Patient characteristics, exclusion criteria, and conversion rates were evaluated. Complications, DOS, and HLOS were compared.
2:::This was a retrospective claims data study of adult patients with HIV who initiated ART between 2007 and 2013 and had been treated with their initial regimens for at least 6 continuous months. Those with evidence of pregnancy or HIV-2 were excluded. Patients who underwent an ART change were assigned to a switcher cohort; a nonswitcher cohort was then generated by matching up to 20 nonswitchers for each switcher, with replacement. The index date was the date of the first ART change for switchers and was the claim date closest to the corresponding switchers switch date for nonswitchers. Patient characteristics at baseline and post-index annualized health care utilization and costs were analyzed descriptively and with multivariable models. Analyses were performed in the full population and among patients designated as virologically stable (had undetectable viral ribonucleic acid [RNA] for 90 days pre-index) and virologically and clinically stable (had undetectable viral RNA and no apparent clinical reason for switching ART).'
2:::We systematically searched online databases up to March 2017 for randomized trials comparing CABG to PCI with drug-eluting stents. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
2:::This was a retrospective database analysis of patients aged between 18 and 65 years with Medicare and Medicaid, who used an urban safety net academic health center between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2011. We compared patients with and without behavioral health illness. The main outcome measures were hospital admission and ED use. Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for descriptive statistics on categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Greedy propensity score matching was used to control for confounding factors. Rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined after matching and after adjusting for those variables that remained significantly different after matching.
2:::This was a longitudinal, retrospective study using health care claims of commercially insured and Medicaid-insured individuals in the Truven Health MarketScan Databases from 2008 to 2015. Individuals aged < 2, 2-5, 6-11, and 12-20 years with a DS diagnosis (cases; commercial: n = 15,948; Medicaid: n = 11,958) were matched to individuals without DS (controls; commercial: n = 47,844; Medicaid: n = 35,874) using a 1:3 ratio. The annual number of diagnoses was compared between cases and controls within age groups using t-tests, and the prevalence of the most common diagnoses was compared using chi-square tests.
2:::Ninety-four claudicating PAD patients performed maximal isometric plantar flexion contractions lasting 10 seconds in two conditions: pain free (patient is well rested and has no claudication symptoms) and pain induced (patient has walked and has claudication symptoms). Sixteen matched healthy controls performed the pain-free condition only. Torque curves were analyzed for dependent variables of muscle strength and motor control. Independent t-tests were used to compare variables between groups, and dependent t-tests determined differences between conditions.
2:::From July 2014 to June 2015, 21 patients with isolated aortic valve disease at high risk for open surgery received transapical transcatheter aortic valve implantation using the J-Valve system. The primary end point was a combined efficacy end point after 1 year, which included all-cause mortality after more than 30 days and failure of current therapy for aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation requiring hospitalization for symptoms of valve-related cardiac decompensation or prosthetic heart valve dysfunction. Secondary end points were cardiovascular mortality, major stroke, and life-threatening, disabling, or major bleeding after 6 and 12 months.
2:::Daily EDVDBs were collected from a hospital appointed for dog bites in Beijing during 2012-2014. A quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was employed to estimate the impact of temperature on daily EDVDBs. Stratified analysis was performed to examine the temperature-EDVDB association by sex and age-groups. Sensitivity analysis was performed to check the robustness of the results by adjusting other meteorological variables and air pollutants.
2:::An international, multicenter cohort of R0 resected HCC patients were categorized by MC status at presentation. CRS was calculated by assigning 1 point each for initial disease beyond MC, multinodularity, and microvascular invasion. Recurrence incidences were estimated using competing risks methodology, and conditional recurrence probabilities were estimated using the Bayes theorem.
2:::Cancer patients referred to a specialized psycho-oncology clinic (n=208) participated in this study. Distress, depression, insomnia, and QOL were measured with the following questionnaires: Distress Thermometer, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General. Structural equation modeling and path analysis were performed to analyze the mediating effects of depression and insomnia on the relationship between distress and QOL.
2:::Prospective study of severely injured children at a level 1 pediatric trauma center. Rapid thromboelastography was obtained on admission and daily for up to 7 days. Standard definitions of hyperfibrinolysis (HF; LY30 ≥3), fibrinolysis shutdown (SD; LY30 ≤0.8), and normal (LY30 = 0.9-2.9) were applied. Antifibrinolytic use was documented. Outcomes were death, disability, and thromboembolic complications. Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisher exact tests were performed. Exploratory subgroups included massively transfused and severe TBI patients.
2:::A cross-sectional sample of participants with PTSD (n =21), and trauma-exposed controls (n =33) underwent a standardized differential fear conditioning and extinction paradigm, with skin conductance response (SCR) amplitude serving as the index of conditioned responses. The Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI) was used to index catastrophic negative appraisals.
2:::The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients was used to examine national outcomes for adults undergoing deceased donor kidney transplantation from January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2013 (15-year study period). Observed-to-expected rates of graft loss and patient death were compared for low, medium, and high-volume centers. The geographic proximity of low-volume centers to higher volume centers was determined to assess the impact of regionalization on patient travel burden.
2:::Using Canadian observed first floor radon data collected by Health Canada during the period October 2010 to March 2011, seven common PAR radon models used for North American miners and dwelling scenarios were applied. The death rates used for this study were from the period 2006-2009. Smoking data (Ever Smoking ES and Never Smoking NS) collected in 2009 was also used in this study. The original discrete radon data for Canada overall and for each of its provinces are estimated using log-normal and Gaussian kernel density estimator distributions. PAR was then calculated for Canada and its provinces using the empirical, log-normal, and Gaussian kernel estimates distributions. Finally, cancer death cases attributable to radon are reported for the constant relative risk model for the three distributions and the reduction in the cases when the action level 200Bq/m(3) is applied.
2:::Electronic databases and reference lists of relevant studies were searched with no language restriction (PROSPERO: CRD42016036059). Randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, case series, qualitative and mixed-methods studies objectively assessing compliance levels were identified. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaborations risk of bias tool, risk of bias in non-randomized studies of interventions (ROBINS-I), or mixed-methods appraisal tool based on their design.'
2:::The cohort comprised 472 children treated for their first culture-positive pyelonephritis and investigated with ultrasound and renal scintigraphy. We excluded patients with known urological anomalies and patients born before routine antenatal ultrasound. We followed the cohort for a median of 5.7 years (3.1-10.1 years) by reviewing their medical reports.
2:::This cross-sectional study included patients diagnosed with ASD aged between 5 and 18 years. Randomly selected healthy children with the same demographic characteristics comprised the control group. Dental charts were reviewed to obtain the childrens sociodemographic characteristics and type of occlusion. Information on each child's molar occlusion classification (Angle classification), midline deviation, crossbite, open bite, overbite, overjet, and crowding were recorded. The statistical analysis used descriptive analysis, the Pearson chi-square test, and multivariate logistic regression.'
2:::The global levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase were measured in spinal cords in mice treated with complete Freunds adjuvant. Immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and behavioral tests were used to explore the downstream ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase-dependent signaling pathway.'
2:::An online survey of U.S. women was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of endometriosis, as well as symptoms, demographics, and clinical characteristics of the respondents. Women aged 18-49 years (inclusive) with endometriosis completed the Health-related Productivity Questionnaire to assess presenteeism and absenteeism for employed and household work. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample, survey responses, and the effect of endometriosis symptom severity on household chore and employment productivity. Regression analyses were performed to examine the effect of individual endometriosis symptoms on employment and household productivity lost because of presenteeism and absenteeism.
2:::Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced electrically in anaesthetised healthy adult pigs and left untreated for seven minutes followed by randomisation to manual ventilation with 50% or 100% oxygen and mechanical chest compressions (LUCAS(®)). Defibrillation was performed at thirteen minutes and repeated if necessary every two minutes with 1mg intravenous adrenaline. Cerebral oxygenation was measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (rSO2, INVOS™5100C Cerebral Oximeter) and with a probe (NEUROVENT-PTO, RAUMEDIC) in the frontal brain cortex (PbO2). Heart biopsies were obtained 20min after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) with an analysis of mitochondrial respiration (OROBOROS Instruments Corp., Innsbruck, Austria), and compared to four control animals without VF and CPR. Brain rSO2 and PbO2 were log transformed and analysed with a mixed linear model and mitochondrial respiration with an analysis of variance.
2:::In a nested case-control study, 300 persons without diabetes had baseline examinations between 1969 and 1974; 149 developed diabetes (cases) and 151 remained non-diabetic (controls) during 8.0 and 23.1 years of follow-up, respectively. POPs were measured at baseline. ORs for diabetes were computed by logistic regression analysis. The cases were followed from diabetes onset to ESRD, death or 2013. HRs for ESRD and mortality were computed by cause-specific hazard models. Patterns of association were explored using principal components analysis.
2:::Planned analysis of data collected during an international 7-day cohort study of adults undergoing elective in-patient surgery. We used risk-adjusted mixed-effects logistic regression models to evaluate the association between admission to critical care immediately after surgery and in-hospital mortality. We evaluated hospital-level associations between mortality and critical care admission immediately after surgery, critical care admission to treat life-threatening complications, and hospital provision of critical care beds. We evaluated the effect of national income using interaction tests.
2:::Diffusion tensor imaging was performed with a 3-T scanner in 93 patients with NMOSD, 53 patients with MS and 43 HCs. Voxel-wise statistical analyses of the DTI data were performed using tract-based spatial statistics.
2:::Ninety patients with misophonia received eight bi-weekly group CBT sessions. Treatment response was defined as a Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Scale (CGI-I) score at endpoint of 1 or 2 (very much or much improved) and a 30% or greater reduction on the Amsterdam Misophonia Scale (A-MISO-S), a measure of the severity of misophonia symptoms.
2:::We identified 8 patients who did not show clinical symptoms of TGA, despite the presence of hippocampal lesions on DWI (No-TGA group, n=8). For the comparison group, 16 age-matched and sex-matched patients were selected from among patients who had been diagnosed with TGA (TGA group, n=16).
2:::The exposure-response relationship between temperature and hemorrhagic stroke was firstly examined, and then the association between daily mean temperature and hemorrhagic stroke was investigated using a generalized additive model. Stratified analyses were conducted to examine the potential effect modification of hypertension.
2:::College students (N=239) at a large South Central university completed self-report measures of demographics, alcohol use and consequences, use of PBS, and trait mindfulness.
2:::The objective was addressed through the development of a critically appraised topic that included a clinical scenario, structured question, literature search strategy, critical appraisal, assessment of results, evidence summary, commentary, and bottom-line conclusions. Participants included consultant and resident neurologists, a medical librarian, and content experts in the fields of vascular neurology and ophthalmology.
2:::Electronic and manual searches were used to identify potential studies for inclusion. Studies were selected based on reported response rates to second-line therapies in children who failed response to prednisone and azathioprine. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by 2 reviewers. Meta-analysis using weighted estimate of response rates at 6 months was performed for each treatment option. Heterogeneity was assessed.
2:::After population-based baseline screening, 145 precursor and 335 chronic inflammation cases were endoscopically surveyed for six years.
2:::We retrospectively reviewed charts of 196 patients of age 4 to 18 years evaluated for gastroparesis between 2009 and 2013. All patients completed a standard solid-phase gastric emptying scan and upper endoscopy within a 12-month period. We analyzed gross and histologic endoscopy findings. Symptom-based data were collected on dyspeptic symptoms and classic ""red-flag"" symptoms.
2:::Thirty children with FASD or prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) (ages 4 to 8) and their primary caregivers were enrolled. Families were randomized to either the Families on Track Integrated Preventive Intervention or an active control of neuropsychological assessment and personalized community referrals. The 30-week intervention integrates scientifically validated bimonthly, in-home parent behavioral consultation, and weekly child skills groups. Outcomes measured at baseline and follow-up postintervention included intervention satisfaction, child emotional and behavioral functioning, child self-esteem, caregiver knowledge of FASD and advocacy, caregiver attitudes, use of targeted parenting practices, perceived family needs met, social support, and self-care. Data analysis emphasized calculation of effect sizes and was supplemented with analysis of variance techniques.
2:::In a birth cohort study, the lactulose:mannitol (L:M) test was administered to 1980 children at 4 time points in the first 24 months of life in 8 countries. Data from the Brazil site with an incidence of diarrhea similar to that seen in the United States and no growth faltering was used as an internal study reference to derive age- and sex-specific z scores for mannitol and lactulose recoveries and the L:M ratio.
2:::A total of 61 prospectively collected cases, including 40 children with EoE and 21 children with GERD, and a control group of 14 sex- and age-matched healthy children were enrolled. Patients with EoE were treated with skin testing-driven elimination diet and/or corticosteroids. The immunohistochemical expression of FLG and POSTN was evaluated in esophageal biopsies obtained from patients and controls, and the results were correlated with EoE-related clinicopathological parameters.
2:::The models were compared for the United Kingdom Glaucoma Treatment Study (UKGTS) data for the right eyes of 489 patients recently diagnosed with glaucoma. The SITA 24-2 program was utilised for perimetry and Stratus OCT fast scanning protocol for thickness of circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL). The first analysis defined progression in terms of decline in RNFL thickness. The highest and lowest quintiles (22 subjects per group) were identified for change in thickness of inferior temporal (IT), superior temporal (ST), and global RNFL (μm year(-1) ); a two-way anova was used to look for differences between the models in ability to discriminate the two quintiles. The second analysis defined a progression group' as those who were flagged by the UKGTS criteria as having progressive loss in perimetric sensitivity, and a 'no progression' group as those with rate of change in Mean Deviation (MD) closest to 0 dB year(-1) (87 subjects per group). The third analysis characterised variability of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) models for the two groups in the second analysis, using the standard deviation of residuals from linear regression of ganglion cell number over time to compute Coefficient of Variation (CoV).'
2:::We reviewed pathology reports from 9171 children (ages 0-18) with at least 1 duodenal biopsy, and 8280 children with at least 1 esophageal biopsy, with specimens submitted to a national pathology laboratory. Frequency of adherence to diagnostic guidelines and recommendations for CD and EoE were determined, and the effect of this upon detection of CD and EoE.
2:::We conducted a retrospective chart review of the University of Chicago Celiac Center clinic charts from January 2002 to October 2014. Demographics, serologic testing, intestinal biopsies, and extraintestinal symptoms at presentation, 12, 24, and >24 months were recorded. Extraintestinal symptoms included abnormal liver enzymes, arthralgia/arthritis, dermatitis herpetiformis, alopecia, fatigue, headache, anemia, stomatitis, myalgias, psychiatric disorders, rashes, seizures, neuropathy, short stature, delayed puberty, osteoporosis, and infertility.
2:::A 24-question online survey was distributed to rock climbers about upper extremity injuries sustained during rock climbing. Statistical analysis was used to study association between participants demographics and injuries.'
2:::Rat xenograft models of C6 glioma (n = 7, body weight 241 ± 28.0 g) were used for the study. PET was performed 60 min after intravenous injection of (18)F-FBPA (30.5 ± 0.7 MBq). After the PET scanning, BPA-fructose (167.3 ± 18.65 mg/kg) was administered by slow intravenous injection to the same subjects. The rats were killed 60 min after the BPA injection and tissue samples were collected from the major organs and tumors. The absolute boron concentrations (unit: ppm) in the samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The boron concentrations in the tissues/tumors were also estimated from the (18)F-FBPA PET images using the following formula: estimated absolute boron concentration (ppm) = 0.0478 × [BPA dose (mg/kg)] × SUV. The measured absolute boron concentrations (mBC) by ICP-OES and the estimated boron concentrations (eBC) from the PET images were compared.
2:::Between 2009 and 2014, 18 patients were diagnosed with THIS. The age, sex, hand involved, activity responsible for symptoms, and defining characteristics were recorded. The physical findings, along with ancillary studies, were reviewed. Delay in diagnosis and misdiagnoses were assessed. Treatment, either conservative or surgical, is presented. Follow-up outcomes are presented.
2:::Patients with metastatic breast cancer were to receive either 100 or 150 or 200 mg oral ART daily as add-on to their guideline-based oncological therapy for a study period of four weeks with frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring until 4-8 weeks thereafter. According to the statistical design, recruitment was scheduled in groups of three patients in order not to miss a more than 33% frequency of dose-limiting adverse events (DL-AE) prior to dose escalation.
2:::Consecutive cases of single TFR surgery with MAC were compared with WALANT. All surgeries were performed in the same manner, at the same facility, and by the same surgeon. Total operating room (OR) time, surgical time, recovery time, and anesthesia costs were analyzed.
2:::Eleven patients were treated with wrist reconstructive hemiarthroplasty. Indications included 1 patient with scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse, 9 patients with scapholunate advanced collapse, and 1 patient with capitolunate arthritis. Average age was 63 years; average follow-up was 4 years. Objective parameters included Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH), grip strength, and range of motion. Implant failure defined by necessity of revision procedure.
2:::The studies cited in this systematic review were identified using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
2:::A total of 2047 patients were identified for syndactyly surgery at 38 pediatric hospitals from 2009 to 2012 using the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database. We examined costs as well as complication rates across hospitals stratified by patient and hospital variables.
2:::Using data from surveillance of nasopharyngeal carriage and enhanced surveillance for IPD, a serotype specific ""invasive capacity (IC)"" was computed by dividing the incidence of IPD due to serotype x by the carriage prevalence of that same serotype in children <7years of age in Massachusetts. We have evaluated the serotype specific invasive capacity in two periods; pre-PCV13 (2001/02, 2003/04, 2006/07, 2008/09) and post-PCV13 (2010/11 and 2013/14), and by age groups; <24monthsvs. ≥24months.
2:::A sterile ophthalmic solution of 0.3 mg/mL tacrolimus was prepared in triplicate under aseptic conditions by diluting tacrolimus in eye drops. Three aliquots of this solution were transferred into polypropylene bottles and stored at 25, 2-8, or -15 to -25 °C. Samples were collected immediately after preparation and at selected time points and assayed in triplicate using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Samples were also visually examined for macroscopic changes. The 0.3-mg/mL tacrolimus solution was also exposed to acidic treatment and heat to force its degradation and to evaluate the selectivity of the analytic method. The tacrolimus ophthalmic solution was considered stable if at least 90% of the mean initial concentration remained when analyzed by HPLC.
2:::The sample consisted of 35 adults with normal occlusions and 35 adults with Class III dentofacial deformities with no previous orthodontic treatment. Buccolingual inclinations and alveolar bone thickness were measured at 3 heights from the cementoenamel junction from 3-dimensional images generated by cone-beam computed tomography.
2:::From a total of 760 consecutive DMEK surgeries, 41 eyes required rebubbling. Of those, 33 eyes of 31 patients were successful and were included in our retrospective outcome analysis study. Main outcome measures were compared with those of matched controls with uneventful primary DMEK (attached DMEK grafts without rebubbling). Rebubbling was performed on average 25 (±20) days (range 7-91 days) after DMEK. All eyes were evaluated for best-corrected visual acuity, endothelial cell density (ECD), pachymetry, and complications up to 6 months after rebubbling.
2:::Cone-beam computed tomography scans of 38 patients with suspected upper airway obstruction were analyzed. Two calibrated evaluators applied a previously validated method to quantify nasopharyngeal minimal cross-sectional airway and volume using Dolphin Imaging. Assessments were compared against grades of obstruction provided by otolaryngologists diagnoses.'
2:::The Wiesbaden Prematurity Study investigated 503 participants of former gestational age ≤32 weeks and gestational age ≥37 weeks now being aged 4 to 10 years. This study included 485 participants in the prospective controlled cross-sectional, hospital-based study with successful Pentacam Scheimpflug imaging. Anterior segment parameters, axial length measurements, and associated factors were analyzed.
2:::Intrinsic muscle involvement in the middle digits was recorded in the operative reports of patients undergoing Dupuytrens surgery between October of 2013 and February of 2016. The anatomical variations of diseased fascia were delineated and classified.'
2:::A prospective analysis was conducted using consecutive patients with unilateral craniofacial contour deformities who underwent autologous free fat grafting between 2012 and 2015. Standardized ultrasonographic craniofacial soft-tissue thickness measurements were adopted to determine the fat graft retention. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of 12-month postoperative fat graft retention.
2:::Cervical LN and lung melanoma metastasis models were established in C57BL/6 mice. Primary tumors were created by injection of melanoma cells into the pinna, and the resulting cervical LN metastases were evaluated. Lung metastases were created by intravenous injection of melanoma cells. The mice underwent (18)F-FDG and (18)F-5-FPN positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. A biodistribution study was conducted after imaging. Histopathologic evaluation of the tumors was also performed.
2:::The authors reviewed 475 consecutive DIEP flap cases in 333 patients at a single large academic medical center over a 3-year period, addressing potential confounders using univariate analyses.
2:::We prospectively identified locations of AF rotors and focal sources, and correlated these to GP sites in 97 consecutive patients (age 59.9±11.4, 73% persistent AF). AF was recorded with 64-pole catheters with activation/phase mapping, and related to anatomic GP sites on electroanatomic maps.
2:::The authors reviewed the scientific literature from 2000 to 2015 regarding treatment of metacarpal fractures. Cadaver models were used for instructional videography demonstrating common surgical techniques. Multiple-choice questions were created to review pertinent topics. A discussion and references are provided.
2:::Near infrared imaging was carried out after balloon-injury and injection of fluorescent ANV or ANV-6L15 to examine their bio-distributions. For peri-procedure treatment, TAP-ANV or ANV-6L15 was administered as i.v. boluses 3 times: 30-minutes before balloon-injury, immediate after procedure, and 120-minutes post-balloon-injury. For extended treatment, additional i.v. bolus injection was given on day-2, day-3 and every other day thereafter. Carotid arteries were collected on day-7 and day-14 for analysis. Blood was collected for measurement of clotting parameters.
2:::Eight fresh-frozen porcine knees were used, and a 6°-of-freedom (DOF) robotic system was utilized. A 5 Nm of V-V torque was applied to the intact knee, the ACL-deficient knee, and the ACL-deficient knee with 30 N of constant posterior tibial load, at 30° and 60° of flexion. Then, the 3D path in the intact knee was reproduced on the ACL-deficient knee. The total V-V angle under 5 Nm of V-V torque was assessed and compared among the three statuses. The in situ forces of the ACL under 5 Nm of varus and valgus torques, respectively, were also calculated.
2:::145 eyes of 145 participants with diabetes but no DPN at baseline were examined for incident DPN. HbA1c levels, nephropathy, neuropathy (DPN), cardiovascular measures, and various retinal thickness measures were examined at baseline and after 4 years. Incidence of DPN was defined as newly developed DPN at follow-up. Baseline factors were assessed by univariate and a step-wise multiple logistic regression, and the predictors were examined for diagnostic capabilities.
2:::The Presaje survey was conducted in 2011 on a randomized sample of 1453 young adults aged 18-25 years who attended five ""missions locales"" in mainland France. Data were analyzed and compared with those of participants of the same age interviewed in a French national health survey (Baromètre Santé 2010, n=2899) and in a regional cohort (SIRS, n=204) conducted in the Greater Paris area, both in 2010.
2:::VA was determined uniocularly for adults under conditions of spherical (0.0-3.0 DS; n = 23) and astigmatic (0.0-3.0 DC at 90° and 180°; n = 20) defocus using the Cardiff Acuity Test (vanishing optotypes), crowded linear Lea Symbols (picture-optotype recognition task) and the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter chart.
2:::This was a cross-sectional, observational study that took place in the Eye Institute of Thrace, Democritus University, Greece. Eighty eyes formed the KC group, 55 eyes formed the SKC group while 50 normal eyes populated the control group. A self-developed algorithm in visual basic for Microsoft Excel performed a Fourier series harmonic analysis for the posterior corneal sagittal curvature data. The algorithm decomposed the obtained curvatures into a spherical component, regular astigmatism, asymmetry and higher order irregularities for averaged central 4 mm and for each individual ring separately (1, 2, 3 and 4 mm). The obtained values were evaluated for their diagnostic capacity using receiver operating curves (ROC). Logistic regression was attempted for the identification of a combined diagnostic model.
2:::A detailed description of the sinus hemodynamics for valve-in-valve implantation was performed in vitro. A Medtronic Hancock II (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) porcine bioprosthesis was modeled as a surgical aortic valve, and Medtronic CoreValve and Edwards Sapien (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, Calif) valves were used as the transcatheter aortic valves. High-resolution particle image velocimetry was used to compare the flow patterns from these 2 valves within both the left coronary and noncoronary sinuses in vitro.
2:::Subjects (ages 17-42, n = 21) wore short wavelength-blocking glasses prior to bedtime for 2 weeks. The ipRGC-mediated post illumination pupil response was measured before and after the experimental period. Stimulation was presented with a ganzfeld stimulator, including one-second and five-seconds of long and short wavelength light, and the pupil was imaged with an infrared camera. Pupil diameter was measured before, during and for 60 s following stimulation, and the six-second and 30 s post illumination pupil response and area under the curve following light offset were determined. Subjects wore an actigraph device for objective measurements of activity, light exposure, and sleep. Saliva samples were collected to assess melatonin content. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was administered to assess subjective sleep quality.
2:::Fifty infants were prospectively scanned for a variety of clinical indications. The scans were stored and then independently analyzed offline by two observers. The transverse cerebellar diameter coronally from the anterior and mastoid fontanels (TCD-AF and TCD-MF, respectively); the midsagittal cerebellar vermis height and the anterior-posterior diameter from the AF; and the width and height of the fourth ventricle coronally from the MF view were measured. Interobserver variability was assessed using the intraclass correlation (ICC) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each of the paired measures.
2:::In a prospective multicenter study of 239 extremely preterm infants (<29 weeks gestation at birth), left ventricular (LV) global longitudinal strain (GLS) and global longitudinal systolic strain rate (GLSRs), interventricular septal wall (IVS) GLS and GLSRs, right ventricular (RV) free wall longitudinal strain and strain rate, and segmental longitudinal strain in the RV free wall, LV free wall, and IVS were serially measured on days 1, 2, and 5 to 7, at 32 and 36 weeks postmenstrual age, and at 1 year corrected age (CA). Premature infants who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia or had echocardiographic findings of pulmonary hypertension were analyzed separately.
2:::At enrolment in the Amsterdam PrEP demonstration project, HIV-negative MSM were tested for the presence of HCV antibodies and HCV RNA. If positive for HCV RNA, an HCV NS5B gene fragment (709 bp) was sequenced and compared with HCV isolates from HIV-positive MSM (n = 223) and risk groups other than MSM (n = 153), using phylogenetic analysis.
2:::Animals were randomly divided into the following groups and treated: (1) Control (saline), (2) LPS (1mg/kg i.p.), (3-5) 2, 5 or 10mg/kg TQ extract 30min before LPS injection. The treatment was started since two weeks before the behavioral experiments and continued during the behavioral tests (LPS injected 2h before each behavioral experiment). Finally, the brains were removed for biochemical assessments.
2:::Online interviews with open-ended questions and purposive sampling were used. Participants were dominantly psychologists or lecturers in clinical psychology area. Ten males and 12 females with an average age of 28.0 ± 2.5 years voluntarily participated in this study. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and reviewed and analysed by the two authors to ensure accuracy of interpretation.
2:::An anthropomorphic Hoffman brain phantom was filled with an [(18)F]FDG solution of ~25 kBq mL(-1) and scanned for 30 min on a Philips Ingenuity TF PET/CT scanner (Philips, Cleveland, USA) using a dynamic brain protocol with various frame durations ranging from 10 to 300 s. Van Cittert IDM was used for PVC of the scans. In addition, HYPR was used to improve SNR of the dynamic PET images, applying it both before and/or after IDM. The Hoffman phantom dataset was used to optimise IDM parameters (number of iterations, type of algorithm, with/without HYPR) and the order of HYPR implementation based on the best average agreement of measured and actual activity concentrations in the regions. Next, dynamic [(11)C]flumazenil (five healthy subjects) and [(11)C]PIB (four healthy subjects and four patients with Alzheimers disease) scans were used to assess the impact of IDM with and without HYPR on plasma input-derived distribution volumes (V T) across various regions of the brain.'
2:::Extracts of M. paniculata made with petroleum ether (60-80 °C), chloroform, ethanol and water were evaluated for antianxiety and antidepressant activity. The anxiolytic chloroform extract was subjected to column chromatography, yielding five fractions (F1-F5). Fraction F5 (100 mg/kg), which showed notable anxiolytic activity, was further chromatographed to get four subfractions (F5.1-F5.4). Simultaneously, the ethanol extract was partitioned with ethyl acetate to obtain ethyl acetate soluble fraction (EASF) and ethyl acetate insoluble fraction. Phytochemical screening of bioactive extracts/fractions and detection of mahanimbine in M. paniculata leaf extract by thin-layer chromatography was also carried out.

2:::A review of the charts of 5 patients treated with TSCPC as primary glaucoma surgery who developed Urrets-Zavalia syndrome.
2:::We analyzed North Carolina cancer registry data linked to claims data from private insurers from 2003 to 2010. Breast cancer patients were split into two cohorts: a younger and older group aged 21-44 and 45-64 years, respectively. We conducted a cohort study and matched women with and without breast cancer using age, ZIP, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. We calculated mean excess costs between breast cancer and non-breast cancer patients at 6, 12, and 18 months.
2:::Data were extracted from the National Cancer Institutes Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Registry to identify women diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of breast between 1998 and 2013. SEER*Stat 8.3.1 was used to calculate age-adjusted incidence, age-wise distribution, and annual percentage change in incidence. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted for survival analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to determine predictors of survival.'
2:::Researchers in the field of OCD were invited to contribute summary statistics on current and lifetime psychiatric comorbidity, age of onset of OCD and comorbid disorders and suicidality in their patients with OCD.
2:::An obesity model was established in Bama mini-pigs, by feeding with high-fat and high-sucrose diet for 30 weeks. Plasma glucose and blood biochemistry levels were measured, and intravenous glucose tolerance test was performed. Adipokines, including adiponectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), resistin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and glucose-induced insulin secretion were also examined by radioimmunoassay. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in skeletal muscle, which is a useful insulin resistance marker, was examined by immunoblotting. Additionally, associations of AMPK phosphorylation with plasma adipokines and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index were assessed by Pearces correlation analysis.'
2:::The oxygen-sensing paint-on bandage was applied to the left hind limb in a rodent model. Simultaneously, a near-infrared imaging device and Clark electrode were attached to the right and left hind limbs, respectively. Tissue oxygenation was measured under normal, ischemic (aortic ligation), and reperfused conditions.

Participants were asked to provide a stool sample as soon as possible after enrolment and then weekly during their hospital stay. Samples were cultured for C. difficile before ribotyping and toxin detection by PCR. A multivariable logistic regression model of risk factors for C. difficile colonization was fitted from univariable risk factors significant at the p < 0.05 level.
2:::Data were collected from patients presenting to the cardiovascular department at Cairo University Hospital for aortic and/or mitral valve replacement surgery from May 2014 to May 2015. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was done for all patients early postoperative. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was done if diagnosis was not confirmed by TTE. All patients with detected PVL were subjected to TTE and TEE after a 3 month follow-up period.
2:::In the phase 1 portion, eyes were assigned to receive a single, subretinal dose of palucorcel (ranging from 6.0 × 10(4) to 5.6 × 10(5) viable cells). In the phase 2a portion, eyes were assigned to one of 2 palucorcel doses (6.0 × 10(4) or 3.0 × 10(5) cells) determined during the phase 1 portion. The intervention eye was the eye with worse baseline visual acuity.
2:::In this cross-sectional comparative study, we measured AVP by color M-mode and CIMT by using Philips QLAB-IMT software in 100 patients, who underwent conventional coronary angiogram (CAG) between May 2013 and November 2014. Coronary artery disease is considered significant if >50% diameter stenosis is present in any epicardial coronary artery and insignificant if otherwise.
2:::This is a scoping review to identify measures that assess LSS symptoms. Thirty-one subject matter experts (SMEs) prioritized ICF codes and evaluated instruments measuring specific domains. We used a modified Delphi technique to evaluate item-level content and achieve consensus.
2:::Between September 2009 and December 2014, 1484 patients with TBI were treated at our institution, 57 of whom had mTIH after TBI and were include in this study. We performed propensity score matching to establish a control group among the 823 patients with TBI treated during the same period. Patients with TBI rated their headaches prospectively using a numeric rating scale (NRS). We compared NRS scores between mTIH group (n = 57) and non-mTIH group (n = 57) and evaluated risk factors of moderate-to-severe PTH (NRS ≥ 4) at the 12-month follow-up.
2:::Koalas affected by mange-like lesions were reported by wildlife carers, veterinary practitioners or State Government personnel to the Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences at The University of Melbourne and the School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences at The University of Adelaide. Skin scrapings were taken from live and dead koalas and S. scabiei mites were identified. Tissues from necropsied koalas were examined histologically.

2:::The UPFRONT study was an observational cohort study done at the emergency departments of three level-1 trauma centres in the Netherlands, which included patients with mTBI, defined by a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13-15 and either post-traumatic amnesia lasting less than 24 h or loss of consciousness for less than 30 min. Emergency department predictors were measured either on admission with mTBI-comprising injury severity (GCS score, post-traumatic amnesia, and CT abnormalities), demographics (age, gender, educational level, pre-injury mental health, and previous brain injury), and physical conditions (alcohol use on the day of injury, neck pain, headache, nausea, dizziness)-or at 2 weeks, when we obtained data on mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), emotional distress (Impact of Event Scale), coping (Utrecht Coping List), and post-traumatic complaints. The functional outcome was recovery, assessed at 6 months after injury with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE). We dichotomised recovery into complete (GOSE=8) and incomplete (GOSE≤7) recovery. We used logistic regression analyses to assess the predictive value of patient information collected at the time of admission to an emergency department (eg, demographics, injury severity) alone, and combined with predictors of outcome collected at 2 weeks after injury (eg, emotional distress and coping).
2:::Between May 2009 and February 2015, 273 lesions in 266 patients were subjected to miniprobe EUS after CE and curative treatment for well-to-moderately differentiated early gastric cancer (EGC). We reviewed preoperative CE and EUS findings and compared them to the pathologic findings.
2:::The objective is to investigate 349 patients included in a raltegravir resistance study. The early outcome is defined as a reduction of HIV-1 RNA at week 8. The crude method defines all measurements below the limit of quantification to be equal to the limit of quantification provides biased estimates. Such a reduction is censored by the limit of quantification and is subject to selection bias in observational studies.
2:::Between January 2005 and December 2011, 32 consecutive patients with symptomatic type V complete AC joint dislocation underwent surgical treatment using the same technique. The median time from injury to surgery was 45 days (range 24-90). The average median postoperative clinical and radiographic follow-up time was 30 months (range 24-33). Clinical outcomes measures included the ASES score, the visual analog score (VAS), and subjective patient satisfaction score. Minimum follow-up was 2 years.
2:::Sample infants and toddlers had a diagnosis (eg, cerebral palsy) or developmental delay (DD). Colorado Childrens Medicaid administrative outpatient therapy claims (2006-2008) were used to estimate differences, by condition type and number of comorbid chronic conditions (CCCs), of any physical therapy (PT)/occupational therapy (OT) and Medicaid PT/OT spending.'

Adjusted odds ratios of undergoing reconstruction were calculated.
2:::Twenty-three healthy young adults (30.9±3.7yrs) and 20 healthy older adults (69.7±5.8yrs) participated in this study. Gait and prefrontal activation were assessed during three walking conditions: (1) usual walking, (2) dual tasking (internal task demands) and, (3) obstacle negotiation (external task demands). fNIRS measured changes in oxygenated hemoglobin concentrations in the prefrontal cortex.
2:::All nipple-sparing mastectomy cases with implant-based reconstruction performed by the senior author between July 2006 and December 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Therapeutic cases with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging or sonography were included.
2:::Studies were identified in the PubMed database in the period from 1990 to 2015. Inclusion criteria were: non-ecological epidemiological study, with histologically confirmed cancer cases, reporting the percentage distribution of inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylated (MMA) and dimethylated (DMA) metabolites, as well as association measures with confidence intervals (CI) between cancer and %iAs and/or %MMA and/or %DMA. A descriptive meta-analysis was performed by the method of the inverse of the variance for the fixed effects model and the DerSimonian and Lairds method for the random effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using the Q statistic and stratifying for epidemiological design and total As in urine. The possibility of publication bias was assessed through Begg's test.'
2:::We measured conductivity in 260 healthy term infants at the age of four days, and again at four weeks to determine the proportion of successful tests, test duration, and normal values for sweat conductivity in newborns.
2:::Advanced-stage lung cancer patients without evidence of disease progression after or during initial treatment were randomly assigned in a multicenter phase III trial to compare a web-mediated follow-up algorithm (experimental arm), based on weekly self-scored patient symptoms, with routine follow-up with CT scans scheduled every three to six months according to the disease stage (control arm). In the experimental arm, an alert email was automatically sent to the oncologist when self-scored symptoms matched predefined criteria. The primary outcome was OS.
2:::The 2011-2012 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database was screened for all surgical operations classified as ""emergent."" Thirty-day postoperative complications were defined as per ACS-NSQIP (e.g., surgical site infection, respiratory failure, acute renal failure). Each patient-related ESS was calculated, and the correlation between ESS and the probability of occurrence of 30-day postoperative complications was assessed by calculating the c-statistic. Univariate and multivariable models were also created to identify which ESS components independently predict complications.
2:::A total of 45 children with ADHD and 45 healthy children were included. The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS), a semi-structured interview, was applied to all cases by child and adolescent psychiatrist. Age and gender matched participants who admitted to the hospital for any other reasons without any psychiatric diagnosis according to K-SADS were selected as a control group. Sociodemographic data form and The Turgay DSM-IV-Based Child and Adolescent Disruptive Behavioral Disorders Screening and Rating Scale-parental form were applied to the all groups. NO and adrenomedullin levels were analysed by ELISA method with specific commercial kits.

2:::SAMP8 mice and their control SAMR1 mice were divided into 5 groups, i.e. SAMR1, SAMP8, SAMP8 mice supplemented with VD, RSV and VD combined with RSV group, respectively. At the end of the intervention, glucose and insulin tolerance, p-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers in liver and adipose tissue, adiponectin secretion, p-NF-κBp65 and TNF-α protein expression in adipose tissue were determined.
2:::The study population were voice professionals reported for dysphonia as sentinel events during the years 2013 to 2015 in Navarre. Its effectiveness was validated by the cumulative incidence of 100,000 workers for each of the years and Positive Predictive Value as an indicator of suspicion. The declaration was verified as an occupational disease.
2:::24 stroke survivors (3-124months post-stroke) with upper limb impairment participated. They received blinded tDCS during a motor sequence learning task, requiring the paretic arm to direct a cursor to illuminating targets on a monitor. Four tDCS conditions were studied (crossover); anodal to ipsilesional M1, cathodal to contralesional M1, bihemispheric, sham. The Jebsen Taylor hand function test (JTT) was assessed pre- and post-stimulation and TCI assessed as the ipsilateral silent period (iSP) duration using transcranial magnetic stimulation.
2:::A total of 157 patients older than 50 years of age with a DRF treated via volar plate fixation were enrolled in this prospective study. A definition of low appendicular lean mass with slowness or weakness was based on the consensus of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia. The researchers compared functional assessments (wrist range of motion and Michigan Hand Questionnaire [MHQ]) and radiographic assessments (radial inclination, volar tilt, ulnar variance, and articular congruity) 12 months after surgery between patients with and without low appendicular lean mass plus slowness or weakness. Multivariable regression analyses were performed to determine whether appendicular lean mass, grip strength, gait speed, patient demographic, or injury characteristics accounted for the functional outcomes.
2:::We conducted a cluster randomized trial in 148 preschool classrooms. Our intervention targeted language comprehension skills and lasted 1 year and 1 month, with five blocks of 6 weeks and intervention three times per week (about 75 min per week). Effects were assessed on a range of measures of language performance.
2:::We reviewed high-resolution computed tomography scans of the temporal bones of 68 children with isolated nonsyndromic unilateral congenital aural atresia. Images were viewed in the transverse (axial) plane perpendicular to the axis of the mandibular ramus and scanned from the mandibular notch to the condylar top. The slice where the condyle had the largest cross-sectional area was measured and checked for correlation with atresia status, age, and sex. The Jahrsdoerfer score of the atretic ear was calculated and correlated with condyle cross-sectional area, age, and sex.
2:::Peripheral microvascular function was assessed in 50 newborns, divided in three groups: preterms with ARDS; at-term newborns with mild-moderate congenital cardiac disease (Cardio group); healthy controls. Skin microvascular perfusion was assessed using an operator-independent, laser-Doppler camera, under basal conditions and during post-ischemic hyperemia, allowing objective quantification of microcirculatory flow reserve (MFR).
2:::We performed 2-year follow-up of 92 patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty surgery with an uncemented tibia component. Bone mineral density (BMD; g/cm(2)) of the tibia host bone was measured preoperatively using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. The proximal tibia was divided into 2 regions of interest (ROI) in the part of the tibia bone where the components were implanted. Radiostereometric analysis was performed postoperatively and after 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. The primary outcome was maximum total point motion (MTPM; mm). Regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relation between preoperative BMD and MTPM.
2:::Screen-stratified community samples of 4-year olds in Trondheim, Norway (n = 1,042), and 3-year olds in Barcelona, Spain (n = 622), were assessed biennially for symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD), oppositional defiant (ODD), conduct (CD), anxiety, and depressive disorders through interviewer-based psychiatric interviews across four waves of data collection. The parents completed child temperament ratings. The data were analyzed with random and fixed effects regression adjusted for all time-invariant unmeasured confounders (e.g., genetics, common methods bias, item overlap).
2:::Badges, lanyards, and pagers from operating room personnel were swabbed and cultured using the same protocol used for surgical specimens in the operating rooms. Personnel included orthopedic attendings (14), orthopedic residents (20), nurses (19), and anesthesia personnel (11).
2:::The raMOLLI acquisition scheme consisted of five radial echo trains of 80 spokes acquired using either a fast low-angle shot (FLASH) or a true fast imaging with steady-state-precession (TrueFISP) readout at different time points after a single magnetization inversion. View sharing combined with a compressed sensing algorithm allowed the reconstruction of 50 images along the T1 relaxation recovery curve, to which a dictionary-fitting approach was applied to estimate T1 . The sequence was validated on a nine-vial phantom, on 19 healthy subjects, and one patient suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy.
2:::A total of 3123 cases with high-risk pregnancy and/or neonatal asphyxia 72 hr after delivery were enrolled into this study. Fundus examinations were performed on newborns utilizing a wide-angle imaging system (RetCam III). Retinal haemorrhage (RH) was classified into three grades. Maternal, obstetric and neonatal parameters from high-risk infants with RH were compared with parameters from infants without RH.
2:::We prospectively recorded the perioperative data of 308 patients who underwent pulmonary resection between December 2013 and January 2016. We used information from a digital monitoring thoracic drainage system to measure peak air leakage during the first 24 hours after the operation, patterns of air leakage over the first 72 hours, and patterns of pleural pressure changes until the chest tubes were removed.
2:::Mixture model analysis was used, with the following input variables: 13 single-item scores from the IBS-specific Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale, average stool consistency and frequency from a 7-day Bristol Stool Form diary, 12 single-item extraintestinal symptom scores from the Patient Health Questionnaire-12, and anxiety and depression subscale scores from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale. The resulting latent subgroups were compared regarding symptom profiles using analysis of variance followed by pair-wise comparisons.

2:::This was a longitudinal study that included the data of 2000 mother-child pairs from the Amsterdam Born Children and their Development study. At a median gestational age of 12.9 (interquartile range: 11.9-14.1) weeks, maternal blood was sampled for assessment of free T4 and TSH. Overall problem behavior, hyperactivity/inattention, conduct problems, emotional problems, peer relationship problems and prosocial behavior were measured at age 5-6 years using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, which was filled out by both parents and teachers.
2:::In an open-label, case-control design, thirty-three in-patients (21 females) with a depressive episode were treated with various antidepressants for four weeks. Response to treatment was defined as a ≥50% reduction of HAM-D score at the end of the fourth week. Sleep EEG was recorded after the first and the fourth week of medication. HRV was derived from 3-min artifact-free electrocardiogram segments during REM sleep. Cordance was computed for prefrontal EEG channels in the theta frequency band during tonic REM sleep.
2:::VF induction was attempted in 31 patients referred for ventricular arrhythmia ablation. Simultaneous surface ECG and intracardiac electrograms were recorded using biventricular basket catheters. Endocardial phase maps were used to mechanistically classify each VF cycle as rotor or focally-driven. ECGs were analyzed from patients demonstrating both mechanisms in the primary analysis and from all patients with induced VF in the secondary analysis. The ECG voltage variation during each mechanism was compared. Biventricular computer simulations of VF driven by focal sources or rotors were created and resulting ECGs of each VF mechanism were compared.
2:::Incidence and mortality data for 45 notifiable infectious diseases were extracted from a WChinese public health science data centre from 2004 to 2013, which covers 31 provinces in mainland China. We estimated the annual percentage change in incidence of each infectious disease using joinpoint regression.
2:::A survey consisting of 13 questions was sent to one qualified individual at all Nordic departments of anaesthesiology who manage anaesthesia for EVT interventions. The individual completed the questionnaire on behalf of their department.
2:::A retrospective chart review of 479 consecutive patients admitted to the Burn Unit of an academic hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia between March 2nd 1995 and June 1st 2013 was performed. Extensive data regarding patient and burn characteristics and outcomes was collected. Patients with and without pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses at the time of hospital admission were compared.
2:::This survey was conducted in 37 hospital centers across 13 provinces in China from September 2012 to December 2014. We collected information on the subject characteristics. We then assessed the medical and non-medical expenditure for BC diagnosis and treatment, factors influencing the average case expense, variations between medical and non-medical expenditure at different clinical stages, economic impact of overall expenditure in newly diagnosed course after reimbursement to the patients family, composition of non-medical expenditure and time loss for the patient and family.'
2:::Multicentre retrospective analysis of 1699 patients undergoing VATS lobectomy (January 2012-March 2015). CAD definition: previous acute myocardial infarct (AMI), angina, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). MACE definition: postoperative acute myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrest or any cardiac death. Propensity score analysis was performed to match patients with and without CAD. Outcomes of the 2 matched groups were compared.
2:::A radial notch labralization was performed in 3 patients with chronic posterior subluxation of the radial head and developmental dysplasia of the radial notch in the setting of complex recurrent instability of the elbow. A soft tissue graft (typically a portion of an allograft hamstring tendon) was used to create a meniscus-like bumper posteriorly, thereby deepening the radial notch and reducing its radius of curvature. A corrective anterior opening wedge ulnar osteotomy was also performed to realign the radial head with the capitellum.
2:::A bibliographic search on PUBMED of all MRI studies exploring PG volumes in BD and MDD as well as first-degree relatives (RELs) from 2000 up to October 2016 was performed.
2:::We included 104 patients (mean age 38±11.4 years), who underwent TEE for various indications. The patients were divided into two groups according to the median thoracic aortic IMT values (IMT normal group<10 mm and IMT abnormal group≥10 mm). EFTh was obtained using two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography on the right ventricular free wall during systole and diastole.
2:::We retrospectively reviewed 40 autoimmune pancreatitis patients (type 1:37 patients; type 2: two patients; possible autoimmune pancreatitis: one patient) who received EUS-FNA. Among the 40 autoimmune pancreatitis patients, 34 were not histopathologically diagnosed with autoimmune pancreatitis by EUS-FNA, and they were followed up for more than 6 months in our hospital. Moreover, 14 pancreatic cancer patients who were not diagnosed by EUS-FNA were selected as a control group. These 14 patients constituted 3.9% of the 360 pancreatic cancer patients who received EUS-FNA. We evaluated the prognoses of the 34 autoimmune pancreatitis patients and the clinical differences between these 34 autoimmune pancreatitis patients and the 14 pancreatic cancer patients.
2:::Detailed history, pedigree charting, systemic and ocular examination of 10 eyes (5 patients from 2 pedigrees) were carried out. Tests were performed to rule out vitreitis, retinal vasculitis, vitreous hemorrhage, and systemic amyloidosis. Genetic analysis to identify the mutation was performed in 1 patient. Vitreous biopsy, followed by 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy, was performed in the same sitting in all cases. Samples were sent for Congo red staining and polarized microscopy. Patients were followed up on days 1, 7, and 28 and then every 2 months. Visual acuity assessment, intraocular pressure measurement, and fundus examination were performed each time.
2:::We performed screening echocardiograms in 5227 consecutive patients between January 2014 and March 2015 in 36 senior-focused value-based clinics across six states. We determined the presence of the grade of DD and defined stage B grade II/III (asymptomatic) and of stage C grade II/III (symptomatic) DD by the presence or absence of typical HF symptoms. We obtained prescribed medications from the electronic health record to determine absolute changes in HF therapy before and after the echocardiogram.
2:::From 2010 to 2014, patients younger than 18 years with symptomatic FAI (alpha angle >50°) who underwent hip arthroscopy with minimum 2-year follow-up or reoperation were identified. A group of non-adolescent patients with identical inclusion criteria, except age of 18 years or older, was also identified for comparison. In addition, a separate group of adolescent patients with 2-year postoperative radiographs was reviewed for cam recurrence. Demographic data, operative data, and radiographic and clinical outcomes (modified Harris Hip Score [mHHS], Hip Outcome Score-Activities of Daily Living [HOS-ADL], Hip Outcome Score-Sport-Specific Subscale [HOS-SSS], and International Hip Outcome Tool 33 [iHOT-33] score) were collected.

2:::Diagnostic investigation and whole genome sequencing of a case parent trio was performed.
2:::A convenience sample of ICU patients was simultaneously and independently examined by pairs of trained evaluators by using the revised RSAS, RSS, and RASS. Ninety-two ICU patients were examined a total of 276 times by evaluator pairs.
2:::A total of 9011 consecutive cases with DESs implantation in a single center throughout 2013 were prospectively collected. Two-year clinical outcomes were evaluated between patients implanted with imported and domestic DESs.
2:::We retrospectively reviewed 61 consecutive patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. We calculated CPI from transcranial Doppler studies and correlated these with echocardiographic measures of right atrial pressure. CPIs were compared from patients with elevated and normal right atrial pressure.
2:::Retrospective chart review of children aged 0-18 years with allergic presentations to three Victorian EDs in 2014. Cases were included if an ED diagnosis of anaphylaxis was recorded, or the presentation met international consensus criteria for anaphylaxis.
2:::Retrospective, cross-sectional survey of general hospital patients. The hospitals laboratory and pharmacy databases were combined to identify a cohort of all VPA-treated patients who developed hyperammonemia during a 5-year period. Hospital records of the subset of patients with a psychiatric disorder were selected and reviewed for data collection.'
2:::A prospective observational study conducted at the Royal Hobart Hospital, Australia, between November 2014 and March 2015. Eligible participants were 18 years or older and had undergone surgery requiring an incision. Patients who had undergone surgery related to cancer, childbirth or multitrauma or those with dementia were excluded. Participants were identified through hospital records and mailed a survey within 1 week of discharge. This survey asked about post-discharge pain, management strategies utilized and advice on self-management of pain provided during their inpatient stay.
2:::Data were collected from 10,443 participants in three diabetes screening studies in Leicestershire, UK. Exposure assessment included standard, prevailing estimates of outdoor nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter concentrations in a 1×1km area at the participants home postcode. Three-year exposure was investigated in the primary analysis and one-year exposure in a sensitivity analysis. Outcome assessment included the oral glucose tolerance test for type 2 diabetes. Confounder assessment included demographic factors (age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, area social deprivation, urban or rural location), lifestyle factors (body mass index and physical activity), and neighbourhood green space.'
2:::The results of biomechanical tensile tests with 10 Thiel-embalmed knees were compared with the findings of 10 patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty with a standardised knee balancer at our department. We reconstructed the force-elongation curves of the medial and lateral ligament complex and calculated the stiffness in direct correlation with overall soft tissue stability in full extension and in 90° of flexion.
2:::We analyzed data from 482 adult bipolar patients in Bipolar CHOICE, a randomized comparative effectiveness trial. Bipolar diagnoses were confirmed through the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Presence and severity of mood symptoms were collected with the Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS) and linked to DSM-5 and DSM-IV mixed features criteria. Baseline demographics and clinical variables were compared between mood episode groups using ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables.
2:::296 recently-detoxified alcohol-dependent patients were first compared with 246 matched healthy controls regarding self-reported emotional (i.e. alexithymia) and social (i.e. interpersonal problems) difficulties. Then, a cluster analysis was performed, focusing on the alcohol-dependent sample, to explore the presence of differential patterns of socio-emotional deficits and their links with demographic, psychopathological and alcohol-related variables.
2:::Mice were fed with CL diet for 12 weeks to establish a NASH model, honokiol (0.02% w/w in diet) was added to evaluate its effect on NASH. Murine peritoneal macrophages, RAW264.7 and ANA-1 cells were used to explore the possible mechanisms of honokiol on macrophage polarization.
2:::To reproduce open gingival embrasure in rats, rapid space opening was induced between the lower incisors by the attachment of a compression spring. The loss of interdental papilla height was morphologically evaluated and calculated using standardized serial photographs, microCT and histological sections. Afterwards, HA fillers or PBS was locally injected and changes in the interdental papilla were evaluated.
2:::We performed a meta-analysis after a systematic review of the published literature in PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO to estimate the burden of subcutaneous mycoses in 25 regions in Peru. The disease burden was determined in terms of prevalence (number of cases per 100,000 inhabitants) and the number of reported cases per year per region.
2:::We examined maternal urinary As levels at gestational weeks 24-28 and levels of inflammatory biomarkers in plasma from 563 pregnant women and 500 infants cord blood. We assessed a multiplexed panel of circulating inflammatory and endothelial function markers, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM1).'
2:::We obtained daily data on pollen concentrations, PM2.5 compositions, PM2.5 mass, gaseous pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, and O3), and weather variables monitored in Fukuoka between February and April, 2002-2012. In total, 73,995 clinic visits for pollinosis were made at 10 clinics in Fukuoka Prefecture during the study period. A time-stratified case-crossover design was applied to examine the interactive effects. The concentrations of PM2.5 and its compositions were stratified into low (<15th percentile), moderate (15th-85th percentile), and high (>85th percentile) levels, and the association between airborne pollen and daily clinic visits for pollinosis was analyzed within each level.
2:::Individuals with diabetes (n = 81,793) were identified from the NIVEL (Netherlands institute for health services research) Primary Care Database, which contains data for standardised routine care and is representative of the Dutch population. The annual incidence rates of ulcers and other foot abnormalities were calculated using data collected between 2010 and 2013. To account for inaccuracies, incidence rates were calculated using: (1) only individuals with a documented foot examination; (2) all individuals; and (3) individuals with explicit documentation of present/absent foot ulceration.
2:::A pretest-posttest design with control group was employed to investigate the intervention effects in a subsample of 100 children, 51 from the intervention neighborhood and 49 from the control neighborhood. The children wore pedometers for one week, and their parents completed questionnaires at two time points: before the intervention began and during the last two weeks of the intervention. JETB was conducted in the intervention neighborhood from 17:30 to 20:30, twice a week, from September to December 2014. Stewards ensured that the children were safe. Children and adults were assessed using systematic observation.
2:::Modelled daily pollutant concentrations based on a combination of measurements and dispersion modelling were linked at postcode level to incident stroke events stratified by haemorrhagic and ischaemic subtypes. The data were analysed using a time-stratified case-cross-over approach. Conditional logistic regression models included natural cubic splines for daily mean temperature and daily mean relative humidity, a binary term for public holidays and a sine-cosine annual cycle. Of primary interest were same day mean concentrations of particulate matter <2.5 and <10 µm in diameter (PM2.5, PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and NO2+nitrogen oxide (NOX).
2:::Sixteen individuals (M/F: 10/6) ran at self-selected speeds for 800m under three stroller conditions (2-Hands, 1-Hand, and Push/Chase) and an independent running control.
2:::We reviewed the clinical and laboratory data in patients with Q fever hepatitis who underwent liver biopsy during a 17-year period, and whose biopsied tissues were available. We also selected patients who revealed granuloma in liver biopsy and with no Q fever diagnosis within the last 3 years as control. Acute Q fever hepatitis was diagnosed if two or more of the following clinical, serologic, or histopathologic criteria were met: (1) an infectious hepatitis-like clinical feature such as fever (≥ 38°C) with elevated hepatic transaminase levels; (2) exhibition of a phase II immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies titer by IFA of ≥ 1:128 in single determination, or a four-fold or greater rise between two separate samples obtained two or more weeks apart; (3) histologic finding of biopsy tissue showing characteristic fibrin ring granuloma.
2:::Forty-one patients (mean age 63 ± 13 years, 31 male) with hepatic tumors (18 hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], six cholangiocarcinoma [CCC], 10 metastatic tumors, one neuroendocrine malignancy, and six benign lesions) underwent FDG PET/MRI before treatment. Maximum standard uptake (SUVmax) values from FDG PET and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from the diffusion-weighted images were obtained for the tumor and their relationships were examined. We also investigated the difference in SUVmax and ADC for each type of tumor.
2:::Non-tumoral (NT), tumoral (TT) liver samples, lymph nodes and ascitic fluid from patients undergoing orthotopic-liver-transplantation (N=18) or liver resection (N=4) were used for the HCV-RNA quantification; 5/22 patients were tested after or during direct acting antivirals (DAA) treatment. Total RNA and DNA quantification from tissue-biopsies allowed normalization of HCV-RNA concentrations in IU/μg of total RNA and IU/10(6) liver-cells, respectively.
2:::Retrospective cohort study of adult patients prescribed apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban for the treatment of acute HIT from January 1 2013 to January 1 2017. Eligibility requirements included an intermediate or high pretest probability for HIT (4T score ≥ 4) and a positive IgG-specific anti-PF4/ heparin complex assay. The primary outcome measure was the composite of newly diagnosed venous or arterial thromboembolism, gangrene, or amputation due to critical limb ischemia during hospitalization.
2:::We performed a prospective cohort study involving 249 German resident cardiologists and analyzed the 1-year effectiveness and safety of ivabradine used in CHF outpatients. Data on symptoms, quality of life, and hospitalizations were collected.
2:::All live-born HF patients with pleural effusion, except for chromosomal abnormality or complex congenital heart disease, born from 2009 to 2013 in Aichi Prefecture in Japan were included. The prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal information was obtained from their medical records and was retrospectively analyzed.
2:::We compared the proportion of patients with a positive bronchodilator response between two groups of children with asthma, one group in which post-bronchodilator administration wait times were not standardized (pre-intervention) to another in which the wait time was extended to 15 min to adhere to ATS/ERS standards (post-intervention). We also determined the effect of this intervention on clinic appointment duration.
2:::We developed a model to estimate the national burden of severe pneumococcal disease, i.e. disease requiring hospitalisation, pre- (2005-2008) and post-PCV introduction (2012-2013) in children aged 0-59 months in South Africa. We estimated case numbers for invasive pneumococcal disease using data from the national laboratory-based surveillance, adjusted for specimen-taking practices. We estimated non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia case numbers using vaccine probe study data. To estimate pneumococcal deaths, we applied observed case fatality ratios to estimated case numbers. Estimates were stratified by HIV status to account for the impact of PCV and HIV-related interventions. We assessed how different assumptions affected estimates using a sensitivity analysis. Bootstrapping created confidence intervals.
2:::All cases of USGTP at our institution from September 2015-August 2016 were reviewed. Data included demographics, operative time, complications, time to first feeding, and 30-day readmissions. All steps of the procedure were carried out using ultrasound guidance, resulting in placement of a low-profile G-tube.
2:::The study was carried out on paraffin-embedded tissues of 30 normal oral mucosa (NOM) and 140 OPMD cases. OPMD cases were classified into two groups no/questionable/hyperkeratosis/mild' = low-risk epithelial dysplasia (LRED) and 'moderate or severe' = high-risk epithelial dysplasia (HRED). The immunohistochemistry was carried out to evaluate the expression of Ki67, CD 105, and α-SMA antigen.'
2:::Spectral-domain OCT mGCIPL and pRNFL deviation maps were obtained for the baseline (from January 2012 to August 2012) and again for the follow-up (from January 2015 to August 2015). An integrated deviation map thereafter was merged by vascular landmark-guided superimposition of mGCIPL and pRNFL deviation maps onto RNFL imagery. On the basis of an earlier schematic model, the inferotemporal peripapillary area was divided into (1) the macular vulnerability zone (MVZ) and (2) the inferoinferior portion.
2:::A polysomnography was conducted for the diagnosis of OSA in 90 snoring children, in a tertiary hospital. Anthropometric and clinical data were measured and venous blood samples were collected for the measurement of plasma glucose, insulin, HbA1c, and amino acids.
2:::A total of 81 infants with a gestational age (GA) of 28-34 weeks were eligible and were randomized to nCPAP (n = 42) or to nHFOV (n = 39). The need for IMV was the primary outcome. The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and air leaks, and mortality were considered as secondary outcomes.
2:::In total, 536 relapsing MS patients from Strasbourg city (France) were included, accounting for 2052 relapses over 2000-2009 period. A case-crossover design was used with cases defined as the days of relapse and controls being selected in the same patient at plus and minus 35 days. Different lags from 0 to 30 days were considered. Conditional logistic regressions, adjusted on meteorological parameters, school and public holidays, were used and exposure was considered first as a quantitative variable and second, as a binary variable.
2:::MKRN3, DLK1, and KCNK9 coding regions were sequenced in 60 girls with idiopathic CPP (familial in 23 cases).
2:::The study enrolled 52 first-episode medication-naïve patients with MDD and 40 controls for functional network analysis. All participants received the resting-state functional imaging using a 3-Tesla magnetic resonance scanner. After preprocessing, we calculated the connectivity matrix of functional connectivity in whole brain for each subject. The network-based statistics of connectome was used to perform group comparisons between patients and controls. The correlations between functional connectivity and clinical parameters were also performed.
2:::The resting-state fMRI data from 20 patients with schizophrenia, 20 patients with depression and 20 healthy control subjects were collected. A data-driven approach that included local functional connectivity density (FCD) analysis combined with multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to compare the three groups.
2:::We pooled data from the 2008 and 2013 Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Surveys. For HIV stigma, we examined HIV stigmatizing attitudes and HIV disclosure concerns at both individual and community levels. Outcomes of HIV transmission risk behaviors were recent condom usage, consistent condom usage, and self-reported STDs. We assessed associations with multivariable logistic regressions. We also analyzed gender as an effect modifier of these associations.
2:::We studied 28 controls and 30 patients with stages 3 - 4 CKD. From samples of serum (s) and urine (u), we calculated P excretion per volume of filtrate (EP/Ccr) as [P]u[cr]s/[cr]u, TRP/Ccr as [P]s - EP/Ccr, and FEP as [P]u[cr]s/[P]s [cr]u or 1/{1 + (TRP/Ccr)/(EP/Ccr)}. Because a plot of TRP/Ccr against EP/Ccr resembled a hyperbola, we performed a linear regression of TRP/Ccr on 1/(EP/Ccr). From the resulting equation, we derived a hyperbolic formula relating TRP/Ccr to EP/Ccr; from that formula, we calculated TRP/Ccr and FEP as functions of EP/Ccr.
2:::The influence of spherical SVL and four different designs of PALs that differ in the near zone width (PAL 1) or that have different signs and magnitude of horizontal gradients of mean power adjacent to their near vision zones (PAL 3 and PAL 4) on the accommodative response was investigated for different near viewing distances (40, 33, and 25 cm) in 31 subjects, aged 18 to 25 years.
2:::Ten corneoscleral rims were mounted on an artificial anterior chamber (AC). The anterior chamber was filled with air through a limbal paracentesis. A Melles triangulated spatula was inserted through the paracentesis, with its tip penetrating the AC, was then slightly retracted and pushed into the deep stroma above the roof of the paracentesis. A mixture of trypan blue and viscoelastic device (Healon, Abbott Medical Optics, Abbott Park, Illinois) was injected into this intra-stromal pocket using a 27G cannula to create a pre-Descemetic separation bubble. Bubble type and visualization of dyed viscoelastic device were noted. The method was later employed in three cases.'
2:::We performed a single-center analysis of 181 consecutive patients diagnosed with a small-bowel obstruction based on clinical, radiologic, and sonographic findings. Patients with clinical signs of strangulation or peritonitis underwent immediate surgery (group 1). Patients without signs of peritonitis and incomplete stop in the initial abdominal plain film were considered eligible for Gastrografin® challenge (group 2).
2:::Ninety PC patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS randomized into two groups of 45 each. One group received ADT (group 1), and the other received ADT plus tamsulosin (group 2) for 24 weeks. The outcome measures were changes in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), IPSS obstructive and irritative subscores, quality of life (QoL), maximum urinary flow rate (Q max), post-voiding residual (PVR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) from baseline. The treatment response was monitored at 8, 16 and 24 weeks.
2:::A systematic literature search with subsequent screening of the identified articles was conducted to obtain potentially eligible randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and comparative cohort studies. To assess the methodological quality of the included studies, the Jadad Scale or Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used based on the study design. To calculate the pooled odds ratios (ORs) for graft survival, graft rejection and the visual acuity outcome with 95% confidential intervals (CIs), a fixed- or random-effects model was applied based on the heterogeneity across studies.
2:::In this cross-sectional survey, data were collected from a randomized population sample (20-79 years) in Northern Norway. Periodontal conditions were assessed for 1,911 dentate adults with a full-mouth periodontal examination. Probing depth (PD) and bleeding on probing (BoP) were measured at six sites per tooth. Radiographic bone loss (BL) was examined using orthopantomograms.
2:::Participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups: tourniquet application for 30s after forearm application of a heat pack warmed to 40°C±2°C for 15min (active warming group; n=36) or tourniquet application for 30s after applying a non-warmed heat pack for 15min (passive warming group; n=36). The primary outcomes were vein cross-sectional area on the forearm, measured after the intervention by blinded research assistants using ultrasound. Secondary outcomes were shortest diameter, and longest diameter of vein on the forearm, forearm skin temperature, body temperature, pulse, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure. All outcomes were assessed at the same site before and immediately after the intervention, once per participant.
2:::Relevant articles were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct and Scopus, using the keywords: ""Aged"" AND ""Muscle oxygenation"" AND (Exercise OR ""Exercise therapy"" OR ""Exercise Movement Techniques"" OR Hydrotherapy), without limitation concerning the publication date. To be included in the full analysis, the study had to be a randomized controlled trial in which older adults participants (mean age: 65 years at least) were submitted to an exercise-training program and muscle oxygenation assessment.
2:::31 non-contrast, non-arthrographic, shoulder MRIs were evaluated for coracohumeral ligament thickness, rotator interval infiltration, and axillary recess thickening/edema.

2:::A retrospective case-control study was conducted on patients with CUC who underwent an IPAA between January 1, 2000 and January 10, 2015. The study cohort was comprised of patients diagnosed with CDI within 90 days before colectomy; patients with CUC without CDI comprised the control cohort. The primary outcome measure was the frequency of pouchitis after IPAA. Secondary outcomes included time to pouchitis, 90-day postoperative pouch morbidity: surgical site infection, hemorrhage, anastomotic leak, fistula formation, pouchitis treatment and response, and pouch failure requiring end-ileostomy or fecal diversion. Univariate and multivariable analysis was used to determine differences between CDI and non-CDI groups.
2:::The study included 36,656 participants who underwent abdominal CT as part of a health check-up at a single university-affiliated healthcare centre in 2007-2015. Of those, 32,593 participants with data regarding vital status as of May 2016 were included in the final analysis. The main factors evaluated were VFA, SFA and visceral-to-subcutaneous fat area ratio (VSR), and the primary outcome was all-cause mortality.
2:::This is a retrospective review of patients with IBD starting a new anti-tumor necrosis factor-α medication that had computed tomography within 3 months of initiation. L3 vertebral slice was used for segmentation of body composition and identification of sarcopenia. CRP, ESR, Harvey Bradshaw Index, albumin, 25-OH vitamin D, and body mass index at anti-tumor necrosis factor-α initiation and at 6 months were collected. Outcomes included hospitalization, need for surgery, or new biological medication.
2:::The primary endpoint of this study was a composite of achieving/maintaining individualised HbA1c targets without clinically significant' hypoglycaemia (severe hypoglycaemia or repeated hypoglycaemia causing interruption of patients' activities or blood glucose <54 mg/dL). Strategy-A comprised glucose-dependent therapies (N = 99) with a non-sulphonylurea OAM and a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist as the first injectable. Strategy-B comprised non-glucose-dependent therapies (N = 93) with sulphonylurea as the preferred OAM and insulin glargine as the first injectable.'
2:::We performed a cross-sectional study assessing demographics and disease behavior by age at diagnosis with univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. ""Older-onset"" patients were diagnosed after age 60, ""younger-onset"" patients were diagnosed before age 60 but are older than 60 years, and the remainder were ""young.""
2:::Six control rats (C), 8 DE-treated controls (CD), 5 diabetics (D), and 8 DE-treated diabetics (DD) were investigated. Plasma glucose (GLU), triglycerides, total cholesterol (CHOL), high- and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and plasma creatinine were measured. Correlations were ascertained with the diluted thrombin time (dTT).
2:::We searched major medical databases for studies reporting on the effects of coffee or caffeine consumption on a wide range of non-malignant respiratory outcomes, including incidence, prevalence, evolution or severity of respiratory disease in adults. Studies on lung function and respiratory mortality were also considered.
2:::We accessed the Database of the Emilia-Romagna Health Service to select all patients from the age of 20 years discharged with International Classification of Diseases 9 Clinical Modification codes compatible with primary aldosteronism and, among them, those who underwent adrenalectomy in the same period. The prevalence of hypertension in Emilia-Romagna from the age of 20 years was drawn from the Health Search Database. The population from the age of 20 years in Emilia-Romagna has been drawn from the Italian National Statistical Institute. We hypothesized a prevalence of primary aldosteronism of 5% among hypertensive patients and a prevalence of unilateral subtypes of 30% among the primary aldosteronism patients.
2:::In this retrospective study, 282 patients aged 1 month to 18 years were enrolled on intensive care unit admission between 2011 and 2012. Children were excluded if they had underlying chronic diseases and were transferred to other hospitals or discharged against medical advice. The patients were further categorized into 3 nutrition status groups according to the weight-for-age (W/A) z score.
2:::Fine needle aspirates and swab samples were obtained for culture, acid fast bacilli (AFB) and detection of M. ulcerans 16S rRNA and IS2404 by qPCR (16S rRNA) from patients with IS2404 PCR confirmed BU at baseline, during antibiotic and after treatment. Patients were followed up at 2 weekly intervals to determine the rate of healing. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to analyse the time to clearance of M. ulcerans 16S rRNA and the influence of persistent M ulcerans 16S rRNA on time to healing. The Mann Whitney test was used to compare the bacillary load at baseline in patients with or without viable organisms at week 4, and to analyse rate of healing at week 4 in relation to detection of viable organisms.
2:::We performed a prospective cohort study of 732 patients treated with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or apixaban hospitalized for severe bleeding, included prospectively in the registry from June 2013 to November 2015.
2:::We performed a secondary analysis using the theory of planned behavior with cross-sectional data, which included semi-structured individual interviews with fathers (n 10), 8 focus groups with mothers (n 50), and 8 focus groups with women community leaders (n 44) with a total of 104 participants. Our data also included a quantitative survey among pregnant women and mothers (n 321).
2:::A systematic review was conducted in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration recommendations. A search was performed in six different electronic databases using clinical trials', 'hepatitis C' and 'interferon-free' as the main descriptors, and studies that conformed to the inclusion criteria had their data extracted, including study information, baseline characteristics, and efficacy outcomes (sustained virologic response, rapid virologic response, and virologic failure).'
2:::A prospective case-control study of 76 typical chronic CSC patients and 29 controls without ophthalmological history was conducted. Complement activity assays (classical, alternative, and mannose-binding lectin pathway), complement factors 3, 4, 4A, 4B, B, D, H, I, and P, activation products C3d, C5a, and sC5b-C9, and the C3d/C3 ratio were analysed in either serum or plasma. A correction for possible effects of gender, age, body mass index, and smoking status was performed.
2:::hMVEC of the systemic circulation were exposed to graded oxygen fractions of 20, 30, 50, and 95% O2 for 8, 24, and 72 h. These fractions correspond to 152, 228, 380, and 722 mmHg, respectively. Cell proliferation and viability was measured via a proliferation assay, peroxynitrite formation via anti-nitrotyrosine levels, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels via q-PCR and western blot analysis.
2:::We examined consecutive medical ICU patients receiving oxygen with a mask, non-invasive ventilation, or T-piece. A physician inspected each patient for 10 seconds, rated the level of respiratory distress, and then examined the patient for vital signs and 17 other physical signs. We used the rating of distress as a surrogate for measuring the work of breathing, constructed three multivariate models to identify the one with the smallest number of signs and largest explained variance, and validated it with bootstrap analysis.
2:::Two independent reviewers conducted a comprehensive search using Ovid MEDLINE published from years 1993 to 2016 and SCOPUS published from year 1985 to 2017 to screen for relevant studies. The main inclusion criteria included adult subjects, patients with suspected or confirmed signs of infection and relevant outcomes which looked into the role of sPLA2-IIA in detecting the presence of sepsis and bacterial infection in the subjects.
2:::Forty patients were selected and randomly assigned into two groups: Clarithromycin (CLM, n=20): one-stage full-mouth ultrasonic debridement (FMUD) associated with clarithromycin (500 mg - q12hrs for 3 days); Placebo (Placebo, n=20): FMUD associated with placebo pills. Clinical and microbiological parameters were evaluated at baseline, 3 and 6 months post-operatively.
2:::We surveyed individual dispensed prescriptions of opioids in private pharmacies from October 2012 to September 2013. A descriptive analysis of costs included a calculation of the overall and mean maximum price to consumers. Monetary costs were converted from local currency units (Brazilian Real - BRL) to international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP) exchanging rates.
2:::Soccer-related injuries (product code 1267) in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) that were sustained by individuals at least two years of age in 2004-2013 were included. High School Reporting Information Online (HS RIO) data for high school soccer injuries during the 2005/06-2013/14 academic years were compared to NEISS data for those aged 14-17 years in 2005-2013. National Collegiate Athletic Association Injury Surveillance Program (NCAA-ISP) data for collegiate soccer injuries during the 2009/10-2013/14 academic years were compared to NEISS data for those aged 18-22 years in 2009-2013. All datasets included weights to calculate national estimates. Injury proportion ratios (IPRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) compared nationally estimated injury distributions between the HS RIO/NCAA-ISP and NEISS data subsets.
2:::For determination of days with Saharan dust intrusions, we used information supplied by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food & Environment, it divides Spain into 9 main areas. In each of these regions, a representative province was selected. A time series analysis has been performed to analyse the relationship between daily mortality and PM10 levels in the period from 01.01.04 to 31.12.09, using Poisson regression and stratifying the analysis by the presence or absence of Saharan dust advections.
2:::In a retrospective interventional case series of 58 eyes of 58 patients with PCV, we assessed best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), central choroidal thickness (CCT), and number of injections for 2 years. Polypoidal lesions were also evaluated before treatment and after the loading phase by indocyanine green angiography.
2:::This is a longitudinal study of FP cycles from 2012 to 2016. We studied three groups: those without CHC exposure (NO CHC), those with CHC usage with a CHC break (BREAK), and without a break (NO BREAK) prior to ovarian stimulation. We assessed ovarian reserve by AFC at initial consultation and discussed the possibility of CHC suppression of AFC. Patients chose between ovarian stimulation with no CHC break versus ovarian stimulation after a CHC break. AFC was measured serially in the BREAK group. We assessed whether AFC suppression was reversed in the BREAK group. Total oocyte yield was compared among the NO CHC, BREAK, and NO BREAK groups. T tests, ANOVA, and linear/logistic regressions were used.
2:::Ball milling, homogenization in isopropyl alcohol and spray drying processes were used to prepare dry powders for inhalation. Physico-chemical characteristics of the dry powders were assessed via thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffractometry and scanning electron microscopy. The particle size distribution, dissolution rate and permeability across Calu-3 cell monolayers were analyzed. The aerodynamic parameters of dry powders were determined using the Andersen cascade impactor (ACI).
2:::69 ovarian cancer patients who underwent surgery and completed their primary induction chemotherapy were treated with consolidation carboplatin (AUC 10) based HIPEC and compared to a historical cohort that received surgery and primary chemotherapy alone (n = 69). The demographic and clinical characteristics on which we were primarily focused, included patient age, body mass index, surgery and pathology data, chemotherapy regimen, toxicity, and progression free/overall survival.
2:::This post hoc analysis of canagliflozin in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients was divided into Study 1 (pooled analysis of 12- and 24-week placebo-controlled, monotherapy studies) and Study 2 (52-week monotherapy/combination therapy study). The canagliflozin 100 mg group data were compared with placebo or baseline ALT subgroup (baseline ALT >30 or ≤30 U/L) data. The primary endpoint was change in ALT level from baseline. Secondary endpoints were changes in efficacy-related parameters. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated.
2:::A systematic computer-based literature search was conducted on PubMed database.
2:::The investigators identified 221 patients (mean ± SD age, 26.1 ± 13.6 years) with OCD lesions treated operatively between 1976 and 2010 and followed for 16.3 ± 11.4 years (mean ± SD) from diagnosis. Information related to the diagnosis, laterality of lesion, details of treatment, and progression to osteoarthritis was obtained from the medical record. Surgical treatment was classified as fragment excision, fragment preservation (lesion drilling and/or fragment fixation), or chondral defect grafting (osteochondral allograft or autograft). Factors predictive of osteoarthritis and arthroplasty were examined.
2:::We developed a questionnaire including 29 questions. It was spread out to healthcare professionals working at the future implementation sites (in Austria, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and Great Britain) of the U-PGx project in preparation of an educational programme. Aim of the survey was to analyse the current educational situation at the implementation sites.
2:::The static TT-TG distance was measured at full extension for 70 skeletally mature subjects with (n = 32) and without (n = 38) patellofemoral pain. The dynamic patellar tracking patterns were assessed from approximately 45° to 0° of knee flexion by use of dynamic cine-phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging. For each subject, the value of dynamic lateral tracking corresponding to the exact knee angle measured in the static images for that subject was identified. Linear regression analysis determined the predictive ability of static TT-TG distance for dynamic patellar lateral displacement for each cohort.
2:::Forty-five extracted human single-rooted teeth were used for this study. The samples were divided into three groups (n = 15) according to the instrumentation technique used: manual instrumentation (K-File), rotary instrumentation (ProTaper), and reciprocating instrumentation (Reciproc R25). Chlorhexidine gel (2%) was used as auxiliary chemical substance during root canal preparation. Longitudinal grooves were carved on the free surfaces of the roots, providing two halves of each root and resulting in 30 samples per group. Each group was randomly divided into three subgroups (n = 10), and substantivity was evaluated after 48 h, 7 days, and 30 days of incubation. The amount of CHX (in mg/mL) was measured through reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance and the Tukey test for post hoc comparisons (α = 0.05).
2:::This was a blinded and randomized trial in which fifty healthy subjects taste tested iopamidol (Isovue, Bracco Diagnostics), iohexol (Omnipaque, GE Healthcare), diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution (Gastrografin, Bracco Diagnostics), and barium sulfate suspension 2.1% w/v, 2.0% w/w (READI-CAT2, E-Z-EM). Participants scored palatability on a continuous scale from 0 to 40 (0 = intolerable, 10 = unpleasant but tolerable, 20 = neutral, 30 = kind of like, 40 = strongly like).
2:::This was a cross-sectional case review of patients presenting with a burn at the trauma unit at the Red Cross War Memorial Childrens Hospital (RXH) in Cape Town, South Africa.'

Data on sociodemographic and clinical variables, as well as pharmacological treatment upon the admission to the programme, were used to describe pharmacological prescriptions, the factors associated with these medications, and changes in prescription over the last 15 years.
2:::Dogs were randomized to benazepril (0.25 to <0.5 mg/kg) or placebo once daily for up to 2 years in a prospective, multicenter, blinded clinical trial. The primary endpoint variable was the renal survival time, defined as the time from inclusion in the study to the treatment failure endpoint of death or euthanasia or need for administration of parenteral fluids related to renal failure.
2:::Sixty steers aged 8 months were allotted to two feeding systems and fed similar amounts of average dry matter and total digestible nutrient throughout whole experimental period according to each feeding program. Steers were weighed monthly, taken blood at the end of growing, fattening and finishing periods, and slaughtered at 30 month of age.
2:::Pregnancy and labor complications were identified by linking the BCCSS cohort (n = 17 980) to the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) for England. Relative risks (RRs) of pregnancy and labor complications were calculated by site of radiotherapy treatment (none/abdominal/cranial/other) and other cancer-related factors using log-binomial regression. All statistical tests were two-sided.
2:::In total, 142 patients (male:female=84:58, mean age=43.5±9.3 years), who were scheduled to undergo a colonoscopy at Myongji Hospital, were enrolled in this study. Seventy-one patients were asked to use a smartphone app that we had recently developed to prepare for the colonoscopy, while the 71 patients of the sex and age-matched control group were educated via written and verbal instructions.
2:::Data on all patients discharged between 10/2010 and 10/2012 with acute pancreatitis as the primary diagnosis were obtained from the hospital database. Patients with the first attack of AAP were included in the study. Documented BIs during hospitalization for AAP and RAP and the development of RAP and chronic pancreatitis during median (range) follow-up of 4.2 (0.2-6.1) years were analyzed. Patients were also contacted with a mailed questionnaire.
2:::For this study, 36 patients were examined using Doppler ultrasonography (US) along with a contrast-enhanced US for surveillance of vascular complications after LT. The following spectral Doppler US parameters were measured before and after administration of USCA: peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, resistive index, and systolic acceleration time of the graft hepatic artery; peak flow velocity of the graft portal vein; and peak flow velocity and venous pulsatility index of the graft hepatic vein.
2:::The clinical data of 640 Italians and 245 migrants who started combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) at an HIV clinic in Milan, Italy, were reviewed. The migrants were mainly Latin Americans (83 DMs and 56 UMs) or sub-Saharan Africans (52 DMs and 11 UMs), but a minority were of other origin (33 DMs and 10 UMs). Retention in follow-up and HIV suppression were compared between UMs, DMs, and natives 12 months ± 90 days after start of cART.
2:::Electrophysiologists (EPs) from four geographical regions (Western Europe, Australia, Japan, and North America) were invited to participate. Survey questions focused on HRU in the management of three chronic pacemaker complications (i.e. pacemaker infections requiring extraction, lead fractures/insulation breaches requiring replacement, and upper extremity deep venous thrombosis [DVT]). Panelists completed a maximum of two web-based surveys (iterative rounds). Mean, median values, and interquartile ranges were calculated and used to establish consensus.
2:::Ultra-high field (7T) MR imaging using magnetization-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echoes (MP2RAGE) sequence was performed.
2:::Twenty-eight high-risk inpatients were provided with smartphones adapted for data collection. Participants recorded their thoughts and behaviors by using self-report software. Sensors embedded in each device (microphone and accelerometers) and throughout the inpatient unit (Bluetooth beacons) captured patients activity and location.'
2:::The authors conducted a cross-sectional, in-person survey of ophthalmology patients at three US eye clinics. The paper survey was self-administered or administered with assistance from study staff before or after patients clinical visits. The authors used descriptive statistics to summarise patient characteristics and patient attitudes about accessing their ophthalmology notes online. Chi-square and t-tests were performed to assess differences in patient responses between clinic locations.'
2:::All patients who underwent revision ACLR between 2010 and 2014 by a single surgeon were collected, and skeletally mature patients over the age of 17 years were included. Patients were excluded if they were skeletally immature; had a previous intra-articular infection in the ipsilateral knee; underwent a prior alignment correction procedure, cartilage repair or transplant procedure, or meniscal allograft transplantation; or had an intra-articular fracture. An ipsilateral or contralateral bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autograft was the graft of choice. A BPTB allograft was considered for patients aged ≥50 years, for any patient with an insufficient ipsilateral or contralateral patellar tendon, or for those who chose not to have the contralateral patellar tendon graft harvested. Patients completed a subjective questionnaire preoperatively and at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography of all knees were performed preoperatively to assess for associated injuries and to evaluate the ACLR tunnel size and location. Patients with malpositioned tunnels that would critically overlap with an anatomically placed tunnel or those with tunnels ≥14 mm in size underwent bone grafting.
2:::The expression of MMP-2 and -9 in the cornea after suture inplacement, treated with SB-3CT or negative control, was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Inflammatory corneal neovascularization (NV) was induced by corneal suture placement. Mice were treated with SB-3CT eye drops (twice daily for 1 week, 5 μL per drop; 50, 100, or 200 μM). The outgrowth of blood and lymphatic vessels, and macrophage recruitment were analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. The expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and its receptor VEGFR-3 were tested by real-time PCR.
2:::Twelve subjects participated in a crossover study testing 7-min atDCS over M1 in three separate conditions (2 mA, 1 mA, sham) each repeated three times separated by 48 h. Motor evoked potentials were recorded before and after stimulation (up to 30min). Time of testing was maintained consistent within participants. To estimate the reliability of tDCS effects across sessions, we calculated the Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC).
2:::We included employees (N = 8968) who participated in the Danish Work Environment Cohort Study (DWECS), based on a representative sample of the Danish working population. Three dichotomous independent variables were created: MJH in general, combination MJH (i.e. second job as employee) and hybrid MJH (i.e. self-employed in second job). LTSA (≥5 weeks) was measured using the Danish Register for Evaluation of Marginalization during 78 weeks of follow-up. Potential confounders included demographics, health, and work characteristics. Logistic regression analyses were performed to study whether LTSA was associated with MJH in general, combination MJH, and hybrid MJH. Interaction effects for gender, age, total working hours per week (≤37 or >37 h a week), and shift work were tested.
2:::The Nationwide Readmission Database was queried for all patients with nonelective admissions in 2013 and 2014 with a primary diagnosis of trauma. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression identified risk factors for 30-day nonelective same- and different-hospital readmission. The diagnosis groups on readmission were evaluated, and the total cost of readmissions was calculated.
2:::Fifty-one professional football players (60 hips) underwent hip arthroscopy for FAI between 2000 and 2014 by a single surgeon.

Data were retrospectively obtained for each player from NFL.com , ESPN.com , individual team websites, and/or CFL.ca .
2:::The sample consisted of 3 groups: 27 patients admitted to intensive care during a 7- to 14-day period who received mechanical ventilation, 29 patients admitted during the same period who did not receive mechanical ventilation, and 27 healthy patients who had no lesions in the mouth. For all 3 groups, samples were collected from the buccal mucosa by using cytology brushes. Smears were applied to glass slides before Papanicolaou staining and were codified for blind analyses by a cytopathologist. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests were used to analyze the results.
2:::Data on drugs prescribed for cardiovascular primary prevention to participants in the Aragon Workers Health Study (AWHS) were collected from a regional electronic drug prescription database. Several different approaches were used to measure treatment adherence (with the medication possession ratio [MPR]) and proportion of days covered [PDC]) and persistence in new users by therapeutic subgroup. Defined daily dose (DDD) was used as a proxy of the number of days' supply, or substituted with surrogate daily dose values.'
2:::In a prospective cohort study, data were collected 3, 6, and 12 months after discontinuation of ECMO and discharge. Postal surveys included the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, the EuroQol-5-Dimensions-5-Levels health questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised.

Children born to mothers who used β2AA during pregnancy were categorized as exposed, and all other children were included in the unexposed group. Cases of ASDs were identified from the Danish Psychiatric Central Register and the Danish Patient Register. Incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% confidence interval were estimated by Poisson regression models.
2:::Wrist and ankle actigraphy data were collected for 48 hours in consenting MICU patients. Actigraphy-based measures of estimated sleep and activity were summarized by using descriptive statistics. Agreement between wrist and ankle measurements was evaluated using Cohen κ statistics (for sleep quantity) and intraclass correlation coefficients (for activity).
2:::Pap tests with EMCs for women ≥40 years were retrieved from our Laboratory Information System (LIS). Patient age, last menstrual period (LMP) and available follow-up histology were recorded. Follow-up diagnoses were categorized as: no significant pathology, benign, hyperplasia ± atypia, or malignant. The Fishers exact test was used to assess the association between categorical variables, p < .05 (two-sided test) was considered significant.'
2:::A 1-time survey of 268 care providers in 10 intensive care units across the country who had worked at least 4 shifts per month to examine their attitudes toward workload burden, difficulty carrying out the bundle, perceived safety, confidence, and perceived strength of evidence. Logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship of unit-level provider attitudes with ABCDE bundle adherence in 101 patients, adjusted for patients age, severity of illness, and comorbidity.'
2:::Thirty patients with an ICU length of stay > 48 h were included in the study. Within the week after ICU discharge (T1), patients were exposed to authentic ICU sound and questions regarding traumatic ICU memories while skin conductance reactivity was monitored. PTSS was assessed using PTSS-10 at T1 and again 3 months later (T2). Changes in number of skin conductance fluctuations per second (NSCF) between baseline and during the cueing conditions and in relation to PTSS scores (T1) were investigated. PTSS scores at T2 and changes between T1 and T2 (PTSS-CS) were used to investigate if reactivity in NSCF could predict symptoms of PTSD.
2:::The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit were used to assess arousal level and delirium prospectively in all patients with severe aortic stenosis who had transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement at an academic medical center. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between procedure type and occurrence of delirium. Cox regression was used to assess the association between postoperative delirium and 6-month mortality.
2:::A total of 116 patients (female, over 50 years of age) presenting a DRF caused by low-energy trauma were enrolled. Their health literacy was measured using the Newest Vital Sign (NVS). Alendronate (70 mg, orally, once weekly) was prescribed to all patients for 1 year, and adherence was defined as taking at least 80% of the tablets for 12 months and returning for the visit on month 12. Multivariable analyses were conducted to determine whether the patients clinical, demographic, and health literacy factors influenced their adherence to osteoporosis treatment.'
2:::Symptomatic patients undergoing evaluation for suspected choledocolithiasis from January 2008 to February 2011 were reviewed. In the cohort without choledocolithiasis, the relationship between aging and CBD size was examined as a continuous variable and by comparing mean CBD size across stratified age groups. Multivariate analysis examined the relationship between increasing age and diagnostic probability of choledocolithiasis in all patients.
2:::An implant-driven stimulator of the S3 spinal nerve was implanted in 5 pigs. The contralateral tibial nerve was stimulated by an external stimulator. Multiple cystometrograms were performed to determine the effects of single nerve stimulation and combination sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) and tibial nerve stimulation (TNS) on the micturition reflex by infusing normal saline (NS) or acetic acid (AA).

2:::A female proband, her brother, and her mother underwent complete ophthalmologic examinations that included optical coherence tomography and visual field assessments using a Humphrey Field Analyzer with both standard automated perimetry (SAP) and short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP). Genomic DNA from each patient was examined to detect genomic rearrangements involving OPA1; the genetic analysis involved both multiplex ligation probe amplification and conventional Sanger sequencing.
2:::This was a population-based matched case-control and case-crossover study based on secondary data linked together from Swedish national registers. Cases were drivers aged 50-80 years involved in a vehicle crash resulting in injuries between January 2006 and December 2009 for the case-control study (n = 27,096) and from February 2006 to December 2009 for the case-crossover study (n = 26,586). For the first design, four controls were matched to each case by sex, age, and residential area, and exposure was categorized into new, occasional, and frequent use of zolpidem only, zopiclone only, and combined zolpidem and zopiclone. For the case-crossover study, newly dispensed zolpidem or zopiclone users were assessed during the 28 days prior to the crash and compared with an equally long control period using a 12-week washout period. Matched adjusted odds ratios (OR) were computed using conditional logistic regression.

2:::Using the Medicaid Analytic eXtract database for 29 states from 1999 to 2010, investigators established ten two-year cohorts of pediatric and adult patients who received two or more psychotropic drugs with a 45-day overlapping days supply. Among PMP initiators, the prevalence of psychotherapy services, identified from encounter claims via Current Procedural Terminology and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes, was calculated for the six months before and the six months after initiation of PMP.'
2:::Eight hundred and forty-two consecutive emergency CSs during a period of 1 year in a tertiary hospital were studied retrospectively. DDIs were analyzed in Crash and < 30-min urgency categories (n = 528), while the time required to establish regional anesthesia and its success were analyzed for all emergency CS cases.
2:::Retrospective longitudinal cohort analyses were performed with Truven MarketScan Commercial (2010-2014) and Medicaid (2010-2013) databases. Among inpatients with schizophrenia (N=25,401) or bipolar disorder (N=46,375), overall and stratified associations were examined between receipt of an outpatient follow-up visit in the 30 days postdischarge and hospital readmission during days 31-120 postdischarge.
2:::Secondary data analyses were conducted of administrative and patient survey data collected as part of a national evaluation of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) mental health and substance use services. Data for patients who received care for substance use disorders during October 2006-September 2007 paid for by the VHA and who participated in a telephone interview about their care (N=2,074) were included. Measures of patient perceptions of care included perceived improvement and global rating of behavioral health care. Eight quality measures based on administrative data assessed initiation and engagement in substance use disorder care, receipt of psychotherapy or psychosocial treatment, and follow-up after hospitalization. Regression models were conducted in which each quality measure predicted each outcome, with analyses adjusting for patient characteristics and functioning.
2:::In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind study, 280 patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC) received multimatrix mesalazine 4.8 g/day QD or pH-dependent-release mesalazine 3.6 g/day three times daily for 8 weeks.

2:::The DAMES trial assessed the impact of two iteratively tailored, mailed print diet and exercise interventions against standard brochures over a 12-month period. This analysis examined change in diet and exercise behaviors and weight-related variables from baseline to post-intervention for the 50 breast cancer survivors and their adult daughters randomized to the intervention arms. To reduce the potential for type II error in this pilot, p values <0.10 were considered statistically significant.
2:::Billing data from the outpatient sector were analyzed for all persons covered by statutory health insurance in the two-year period 2014-2015. A cohort of pregnant women, constructed by using pregnancy care billing data, was studied with respect to the screening coverage. The prevalence of GDM was determined from the use of the corresponding ICD-10-GM codes.
2:::This retrospective study was performed in a tertiary centre between 2014 and 2015. Combined right portal and hepatic vein embolization (biembolization) was proposed, as an alternative to ALPPS procedure, for all patients with primary or metastatic liver tumour, before right extended hepatectomy. CT scan liver volumetry was assessed before biembolization, three weeks after biembolization and one week after surgery.
2:::Sequential echocardiograms were collected retrospectively at two time points between 2005 and 2015 in 187 patients (71% women; mean age, 63 ± 14 years) undergoing pulmonary vasodilator therapy for group 1 PAH. Patients were either studied during PAH therapy (n = 111) or before and after treatment initiation (n = 76). Standard measurements of RV and left ventricular function and PASP were performed, and speckle-tracking strain was used to calculate RVFWS. The linear response of RVFWS to afterload (PASP) was assessed using a standard regression equation. Because it is unclear if the response might be nonlinear, a quadratic association (PASP squared) was also used in the regression model.
2:::LD and HD were tested in the rat gambling task (rGT) or the delayed reward task (DRT). Next, the effect of alcohol (0-1.0 g/kg) was tested in these tasks. Pavlovian-conditioned approach (PCA) was assessed both prior to and after intermittent alcohol access (IAA). Principal component analyses were performed to identify relationships between the most important behavioral parameters.
2:::We reviewed the HPO database for all diseases, including causative genes related to CULA. All CULA were classified according to the OMT classification; associated non-hand phenotypes were classified into 12 anatomical groups. We analyzed the contribution of each anatomical group to a given disease and developed a tool for differential diagnosis formulation based on these contributions. We compared our results with cases from the literature and with a current HPO tool, Phenomizer.
2:::In a randomized controlled study, 25(OH)D serum levels were measured at enrollment, after 1 week, and after completion of the 12-week period of sunbed use with twice weekly exposure and compared with the control group without any sunbed exposure.
2:::We used data from 5750 children in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, excluding preterm infants and infants small or large for gestational age. Infant regulatory ability was measured at age 9 months by the Infant Toddler Symptom Checklist (ITSC). We created a multivariable logistic regression model comparing risk of obesity at preschool age in infants with ITSC scores ≥6 to infants with scores <6. We further examined the association when stratified by a measure of maternal sensitivity.
2:::We retrospectively reviewed 702 consecutive patients who underwent emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection between March 2004 and May 2015. Our clinical protocol includes rapid transfer to the operating room, quick establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass, temporary aortic crossclamping during cooling, primary entry resection, and open distal anastomosis. We analyzed the perioperative data, survival, freedom from aortic reinterventions, and impact of aortic crossclamping on early and late outcomes.
2:::We used an observational, patient-tracking tool to assess compliance with infection prevention and control practices by 1680 health-care workers during outpatient interactions with 14 328 patients at 935 health-care facilities in 2015. Compliance was assessed in five domains: hand hygiene; protective glove use; injections and blood sampling; disinfection of reusable equipment; and waste segregation. We calculated compliance by dividing the number of correct actions performed by the number of indications and evaluated associations between compliance and the health-care workers and facility's characteristics.'
2:::The root canals of 130 human maxillary central incisors were chemomechanically prepared and the teeth split. A standardized longitudinal intracanal groove was created in 1 of the root halves. One hundred thirty porcine palatal mucosa samples were collected, adapted in order to fit into the grooves, and weighed. The reassembled specimens were randomly divided in 3 experimental groups (n = 40) based on their irrigation protocol (ie, positive pressure [PP] and PUI during 15 [PUI-15] or 30 seconds [PUI-30]) and divided in subgroups according to the NaOCl preparation used: Vista 6% plain (Vista Dental Products, Racine, WI) or Chlor-XTRA (Vista Dental Products) (containing surfactant). An EDTA intermediate rinse was included. Palatal mucosa weights were measured after the assays. The intergroup weight changes were statistically analyzed.
2:::Sixty mandibular incisors were randomly divided into 6 experimental groups (n = 10) according to the systems and working lengths used for the root canal preparation: ProTaper Universal for Hand Use (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland), HyFlex CM (Coltene-Whaledent, Allstetten, Switzerland), and Reciproc (VDW, Munich, Germany) files working at the apical foramen (AF) and 1 mm short of the AF (AF - 1 mm). The teeth were imaged with micro-computed tomographic scanning at an isotropic resolution of 14 μm before and after root canal preparation, and the cross-sectional images generated were assessed to detect microcracks in the apical portion of the roots.
2:::A total of 270 consecutive NSTE-ACS patients hospitalized between January 2012 and December 2014 were retrospectively studied.

2:::In a population-based prospective cohort study of 611 community-dwelling individuals aged 65+ in St. Petersburg (Russia), all-cause mortality risks over 2.5 years follow-up were determined based on the results obtained from anthropometry, medical history, physical performance tests, spirometry and laboratory tests. C-statistic, risk reclassification analysis, integrated discrimination improvement analysis, decision curves analysis, internal validation and external validation were performed.
2:::Abnormal molar occlusion (AMO) was established in the 5- and 16-wk old rats by moving their maxillary left and mandibular right third molars distally. AMO was removed in the molar extraction group at 4 weeks but remained in the AMO group. All rats were sacrificed at 8 weeks. Micro-computed tomography, histomorphology, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR were adopted to evaluate the remodeling of condylar subchondral bone.
2:::FFI was calculated as cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) divided by waist-to-height ratio (WHR). Data from the 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used to identify 16,146 participants, ages 20-85. Data from participants in these cycles were linked to death certificate data from the National Death Index. Person-months of follow-up were calculated from the date of the interview until date of death or censoring on December 31, 2011, whichever came first.
2:::Surface plasmon resonance assay, antibody to G-quadruplex, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to discover Tetra-Pt(bpy), a cisplatin derivative that specifically targets telomeric G-quadruplex. We used immunofluorescence, FISH, C-circle assay, and chromosome orientation FISH to evaluate the inhibitory effect of Tetra-Pt(bpy) on ALT activity in human ALT cancers. The shortening of telomere length induced by Tetra-Pt(bpy) was determined by telomere restriction fragment or Q-FISH. Cell destination after Tetra-Pt(bpy) treatment was determined by β-gal staining or apoptosis assay. Nude mice (n = 4 per group) were injected with U2OS cells to evaluate the effects of Tetra-Pt(bpy) on tumor growth. All statistical tests were two-sided.
2:::In this phase 2, non-inferiority, observer-blinded, randomised, controlled, single-centre trial in the Dominican Republic, healthy infants aged 6 weeks, not previously polio vaccinated, were allocated after computer-generated randomisation by block-size of four, to receive one of four IPV formulations (three-times reduced dose [1/3 IPV-Al], five-times reduced dose [1/5 IPV-Al], ten-times reduced dose [1/10 IPV-Al], or IPV) intramuscularly in the thigh at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. The primary outcome was seroconversion for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 with titres more than or equal to four-fold higher than the estimated maternal antibody titre and more than or equal to 8 after three vaccinations. Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower two-sided 90% CI of the seroconversion rate difference between IPV-Al and IPV was greater than -10%. The safety analyses were based on the safety analysis set (randomly assigned participants who received at least one trial vaccination) and the immunogenicity analyses were based on the per-protocol population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov registration, number NCT02347423.
2:::The item pool which included 35 questions about emotional distress was drafted through a comprehensive literature review. An expert panel review and the first clinical test with 288 general hospital patients were conducted for the primary item selection. The second clinical test was performed to select the final item in 637 non-psychiatric patients. The reliability and validity of the final questionnaire were tested in 763 non-psychiatric patients, in which 211 subjects were interviewed by psychiatrists using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Multiple data analysis methods including principal components analysis (PCA), item response theory (IRT), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to select items and validate the final questionnaire.
2:::Patients that received local infiltration with LB were strictly matched to a control group, and compared for postoperative pain, opioid use, length of stay (LOS), hospital costs, and complication, readmission, and reoperation rates.
2:::A retrospective search was undertaken on all patients with IgM antibodies to CMV and EBV during the period of 2006-2015 in the virological database of the University Hospital of Iceland covering the metropolitan area of Reykjavík (population 202,255). Patients with available liver tests at the University Hospital and/or admitted to this institution were included and relevant clinical data obtained from medical records.
2:::We did an interrupted time series analysis of incident reports of physical assault 30 months before and 12 months after the implementation of the policy in the inpatient wards of South London and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust, London, UK. We used a quasi-Poisson generalised additive mixed model to model the monthly incidence of physical assaults as a function of several explanatory variables.
2:::A retrospective analysis of the EICU including 463 patients was conducted between January 2013 and December 2015 in the EICU of Peking University Third Hospital. The worst physiological data of enrolled patients were collected within 24 h after admission to calculate SAPS 3 score and predicted mortality by regression equation. Discrimination between survivals and deaths was assessed by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Calibration was evaluated by Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test through calculating the ratio of observed-to-expected numbers of deaths which is known as the standardized mortality ratio (SMR).
2:::The exons and flanking sequences of NKX2.1, FOXE1, NKX2.5, PAX8, and TSHR were screened by next-generation sequencing and further confirmed by direct Sanger sequencing. The mutation frequencies were calculated and compared against databases. The relationship between genotype and phenotype was also determined.
2:::Serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was measured in two cohorts of children who received their first dose of MenBvac® at 1-5years of age and accepted to provide a blood sample either one or four years after a 2+1+1 schedule. All sera were tested against the outbreak strain. Sera from responder subjects were also tested against 12 additional B or C strains which were chosen to entirely, partially, or not at all match the two variable regions (VR1 and VR2) of the PorA vaccine strain.
2:::During the study period, the hospital changed its contact precaution policy from requiring contact precautions for all patients with a history of MRSA or VRE to only those who presented with clinical conditions likely to contaminate the environment with pathogens. An interrupted time series analysis of ED admission times for adults for one year preceding and one year following this change was performed at a two-campus hospital. The main outcome was admission time, defined as time from decision to admit to arrival in an inpatient bed, for patients with MRSA or VRE compared with all other patients. The in-hospital MRSA and VRE acquisition rates were evaluated over the same period and have been published previously.
2:::A real-time multiplex PCR method with internal inhibition control was developed for detecting Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium hominis/parvum and Entamoeba histolytica directly from stool specimens. Applicability to dried samples was checked by comparing with fresh ones in a small test material. Finally, the assay was applied to dried specimens collected from Guinea-Bissauan children with diarrhoea.

All participants received a challenge dose of a monovalent hepatitis B vaccine (HBVaxPro® 5µg). The concentrations of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) were measured before and 1month after the challenge dose. The analysis was descriptive and no formal hypothesis was tested.
2:::This study enrolled young female AMI patients aged ≤50 years who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) and intracoronary imaging in our center between January 2013 and December 2016. Their clinical presentations, risk factors, and CAG characteristics were analyzed.
2:::We studied 135 patients (78M; 71±11years) with high risk of hematoma occurrence after pace-maker (63 patients) or ICD (72 patients) implantation or replacement. Immediately after the intervention, a closed-circuit cooling system (CAREPACE™ system, Zamar, Italy) was externally applied on the pre-pectoral region to each patient and maintained for 24h. The system has a compressive pad and a refrigerating circuit in which non-toxic glycolic fluid is pumped. The fluid temperature was set and kept at 5°C for the whole period.
2:::Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates were obtained between January 2008 and December 2008. Isolates were tested for drug resistance against rifampicin (RFP) and isoniazid (INH) using the GenoType MTBDRplus assay and drug resistance against ethambutol (EMB), ofloxacin (OFX), and kanamycin (KM) using the Genotype MTBDRsl assay. These results were compared with conventional drug-susceptibility testing (DST).
2:::A panel of 37 biomarkers from different pathophysiological domains (e.g., myocardial stretch, inflammation, angiogenesis, oxidative stress, hematopoiesis) were measured at admission and after 24 h in 843 acute heart failure patients from the PROTECT trial. HFpEF was defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥50% (n = 108), HFrEF as LVEF of <40% (n = 607), and HFmrEF as LVEF of 40% to 49% (n = 128).
2:::Sixty J-shaped resin blocks (Endo Training Bloc-J; Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) were trimmed to a root-shaped form and divided into 2 groups according to the types of electric motors: WaveOne motor (WOM, Dentsply Maillefer) and X-Smart Plus motor (XSM, Dentsply Maillefer). Each group was further subdivided into 3 subgroups (n = 10 each) according to the designated file systems: ProTaper Next (PTN, Dentsply Maillefer), ProTaper Universal (PTU, Dentsply Maillefer), and WaveOne (WOP, Dentsply Maillefer) systems. Vibration was measured during the pecking motion using an accelerometer attached to a predetermined consistent position. The average vibration values were subjected to 2-way analysis of variance as well as the t test and Duncan test for post hoc comparison at the 95% confidence interval.
2:::During RVA gastroenteritis surveillance in Italy in 2012-14, a total of 2341 RVA-positive faecal samples were collected from children hospitalized with AGE, and RVA strains were genotyped following standard EuroRotaNet protocols.
2:::The NEMA body phantom with determined Tc-99m concentration was scanned with the four state-of-the-art SPECT/CT systems. SPECT data were reconstructed using different numbers of the product of subset and iteration numbers (SI) and the width of 3D Gaussian filter (3DGF). The mean (SUVmean), maximal (SUVmax), and peak (SUVpeak) SUVs for six hot spheres (10, 13, 17, 22, 28, and 37 mm) were measured after converting SPECT count into SUV using Becquerel calibration factor. DRO smoothed by 3DGF with a FWHM of 17 mm (DRO17 mm) was generated, and the corresponding SUVs were measured. The reconstruction condition to yield the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of SUVmeans for all the spheres between DRO17 mm and actual phantom images was determined as the harmonized condition for each SPECT/CT scanner. Then, inter-scanner variability in all quantitative metrics was measured before (i.e., according to the manufacturers recommendation or the policies of their own departments) and after harmonization.'
2:::A qualitative descriptive study design provided an opportunity for student voices to be heard. Ethical approval was sought and granted. Eleven students were interviewed nearing completion of a four year BSc Nursing programme. Data analysis followed a thematic approach, in generating themes.
2:::Data from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013 were pulled from Beijing dialysis registry system. All included patients were followed to the end of 2013. This time period of dialysis was divided into six intervals (≤120, 121-365 days; 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, ≥5 years). Patients demographics, primary cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), date of first HD, date of death, cause for death, date and cause of censoring were extracted from the registry database. All-cause mortality (per 100 patient-years) was calculated for each period stratified by sex, age and cause of ESRD. Monthly mortality rates were also calculated.'
2:::Patients who were diagnosed with UCs or OCs on the basis of final pathology reports and who underwent surgery between January 1993 and January 2015 were included in the study. Data of patients were obtained from Gynecological Oncology Clinic electronic database and patient files.
2:::113 patients with ER+ primary breast cancer treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy at the Royal Marsden Hospital between 2002 and 2010 were included in the study. Pathologic assessment of the excision specimen was made for residual disease. IHC4 was determined on pre-treatment core biopsies, blinded to clinical outcome, by immunohistochemistry using quantitative scoring of ER (H-score), PgR (%) and Ki67 (%). Determination of HER2 status was made by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization for 2+ cases. IHC4 and Ki67 scores were tested for their association with pathological complete response (pCR) rate and residual cancer burden (RCB) score.
2:::We performed a retrospective survey of 835 patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer between January 2010 and December 2015 at our institution. All patients had been screened for HCV infection at the time of breast cancer diagnosis. We retrospectively investigated the toxicities of chemotherapy and the changes in HCV load based on a review of the medical records.

At the third follow up survey, 1.5years after the baseline survey, 1230 of the children had a physical exam and provided urine samples. Their parents completed a questionnaire including social-demographic information and possible sources of childrens exposure to PAHs. Urine samples were measured for the four OH-PAHs using an HPLC-MS/MS technique. Concentrations were corrected by specific gravity. Linear regression analysis was used to investigate factors related to sources of PAHs exposure.'
2:::This observational cohort study was conducted using high-fidelity simulation and multidisciplinary obstetric teams in order to evaluate the validity and reliability of the previously developed PETRA scale for the assessment of teamwork in the management of obstetric crises. Two high-fidelity simulations of preeclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) were conducted 50 times; 42 were performed by multidisciplinary teams and eight (four ""good,"" four ""poor"") were performed by actors. Five raters used the PETRA tool to assess the simulation video recordings. Three additional raters assessed each performance without the use of PETRA as ""good"" or ""poor"" in order to provide an overall rating (referred to as the standardized score). The primary outcome measure was the PETRA score. Cronbachs alpha and intra-class correlation coefficients (2,1) with 95% CIs were calculated to examine internal consistency of the scale and level of agreement among raters, respectively. Construct validity was established by comparing the assessments of the raters with the standardized scores. Generalizability theory analysis was performed to demonstrate PETRA's reliability and to investigate the sources of variation in scores.'

2:::In order to delineate the neurobiological underpinnings of alcohol consumption, we expanded on the QTL approach to identify candidate genes for high alcohol preference in mice. We narrowed down a QTL for alcohol preference on mouse chromosome 2, that we previously identified using CSS mice, to 4 candidate genes in silico. Expression levels of these candidate genes in prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens-brain regions implicated in reward and addiction-were subsequently compared for the CSS-2 and the C57BL/6J host strain.
2:::MiR-500 expression was assessed by qRT-PCR in prostate cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Cancer patients clinicopathological factors and overall survival were analyzed according to endogenous miR-500 level. MiR-500 was downregulated in DU145 and VCaP cells. Its effect on prostate cancer proliferation, invasion in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo, were probed. Possible downstream target of miR-500, TFPI was assessed by luciferase assay and qRT-PCR in prostate cancer cells. In miR-500-downregulated DU145 and VCaP cells, TFPI was silenced to see whether it was directly involved in the regulation of miR-500 in prostate cancer. TFPI alone was either upregulated or downregulated in DU145 and VCaP cells. Their effect on prostate cancer development was further evaluated.'
2:::One thousand one hundred sixty-six stroke-free participants from the NOMAS (Northern Manhattan Study) underwent carotid ultrasound and neuropsychological examination. Among them, 826 underwent a second neuropsychological examination an average of 5 years later. cIMT and plaque were assessed by a standardized B-mode ultrasound imaging and reading protocol.

Length of follow-up after initial surgery was 6.1 years for SGGS and 7.4 years for GR (NS). Definitive treatment was posterior spinal fusion (15 SGGS, 17 GR), implant removal (3 SGGS), or completion of lengthenings (1 GR).
3:::Validation study showed good precision and accuracy of LC-MS/MS. Many CE species were detected in the urinary sediment and supernatant in the renal disease group, whereas only a few CE species were detected in the other group. In the renal disease group, the sum of the concentrations of all CE species showed a significant correlation between the sediment and the supernatant from urinary samples (r=0.876, p<0.001); however, the composition of CEs was significantly different between them. Further, the composition of CEs of the supernatant was similar to that of the serum.
3:::Complete dissolution did not occur in any sample. Chlor-XTRA subgroups were associated with increased weight reduction compared with Vista 6% plain subgroups; however, the differences were significant (P < .05) only for PP and PUI-15. PUI-30 increased weight reduction compared with PP for both hypochlorites and PUI-15 using Vista 6% plain (P < .05). PUI-30 with Vista 6% plain performed significantly better than PP with Chlor-XTRA (P < .05).
3:::Of the 366 patients with at least 1 EIM, 213 (58.2%) were ever treated with an anti-TNF. A total of 299 treatments were started for 355 EIMs. Patients with EIM were significantly more often treated with anti-TNF compared with those without EIM (58.2% versus 21.0%, P < 0.001). Infliximab was the most frequently used drug (63.2%). In more than 71.8%, a clinical response of the underlying EIM to anti-TNF therapy was observed. In 92 patients (43.2%), anti-TNF treatments were started for the purpose of treating EIM rather than IBD. Response rates to anti-TNF were generally good and best for psoriasis, aphthous stomatitis, uveitis, and peripheral arthritis. In 11 patients, 14 EIM occurred under anti-TNF treatment.
3:::The participation rate was 67.9% (n=149) and 65% (n=320) for ICU physicians and nurses, respectively). High job satisfaction was recorded in both doctors (80.8%) and nurses (63.4%). Burnout was observed in 32.8% of the study participants, higher in nurses compared to doctors (p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that neuroticism was a positive and extraversion a negative predictor of exhaustion (OR 5.1, 95%CI 2.7-9.7, p<0.001 and OR 0.49, 95%CI 0.28-0.87, p=0.014, respectively). Moreover, three other factors were identified: Job satisfaction (OR 0.26, 95%CI 0.14-0.48, p<0.001), satisfaction with current End-of-Life care (OR 0.41, 95%CI 0.23-0.76, p=0.005) and isolation feelings after decisions to forego life sustaining treatments (OR 3.48, 95%CI 1.25-9.65, p=0.017).
3:::FHAD was positive in 32 and negative in 68 among the 100 AoD patients with detailed family history information. Mean age at dissection was 59.9±14.7years. Compared to negative FHAD, patients with positive FHAD dissected at significantly younger age (54.7±16.8 vs 62.4±13.0years, p=0.013), had more AoD events in first-degree relatives (2.3±0.6 vs 1.0±0.0, p<0.001), and shorter exposure years per AoD event (18.3±6.7 vs 43.1±8.5, p<0.001). Annual probability of AoD per first-degree relative was 2.77 times higher in patients with positive than negative FHADs (0.0100±0.0057 vs 0.0036±0.0014, p<0.001).
3:::The modelling results obtained with BROWSE showed that innovative cropping systems such as low input or no herbicide systems would reduce the risk for human health in comparison to the corresponding conventional cropping systems. On the contrary, BROWSE showed that conservation tillage system would lead to unacceptable risks in the conditions of our study, because of a high number of pesticide applications, and especially of some herbicides. For residents, the dermal absorption was the main exposure route while ingestion was found to be negligible. For operators, inhalation was also a predominant route of exposure. In general, human exposure to pesticides and human health risks were found to be correlated to the treatment frequency index TFI (number of registered doses of pesticides used per hectare for one copping season), confirming the relationship between the reduction of pesticide use and the reduction of risks.
3:::We identified multiple genomic regions spanning different chromosomes to be shared among affected members of each family; these included chromosomes 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 17, and 18. We also found specific regions on chromosomes 8 and 17 to be shared between affected individuals from more than one family. Among the genes present in the regions reported here were involved in neurotransmission (GRM3, SIGMAR1, CHAT, and SLC18A3) and members of the HLA gene family (HLA-A, HLA-DPA1, and MICC).
3:::After multivariate adjustment, the mean height- and weight-adjusted skeletal muscle indexes (SMIs) for old people in the highest tertile of HOMA-IR values were 6.7kg/m(2) and 27.9%, respectively, which were significantly lower than those of old people in the lowest tertile of HOMA-IR values. Compared with physically active elders with the lowest tertile of HOMA-IR values, the physically inactive elders with the highest tertile of HOMA-IR values had significantly low means in the height-adjusted SMI, weight-adjusted SMI, gait speed, and grip strength (0.25kg/m(2) [p=0.0046], 0.97% [p=0.0068], 0.24m/s [p<0.0001], and 2.37kg [p=0.0085], respectively).
3:::Mean basal AMH level was 4.19 ± 4.84 ng/mL, and was negatively correlated with age. Serum AMH level rapidly decreased in all patients after each chemotherapy cycle to undetectable levels in most of them, and slowly increased in 45% of the patients during the 24-month follow-up. AMH decrease was significantly associated with age and basal AMH level, but not with cyclophosphamide dose and tamoxifen use. The prevalence of chemotherapy-related amenorrhoea was 92.4% at the end of chemotherapy; women with amenorrhoea being significantly older and having lower basal AMH than women who resumed menses.
3:::Students had significant improvements in perceptions of and confidence in research and EBP (p<0.05). They were more likely to agree to plan to use EBP in the future (p=0.007), yet there were no significant improvements on students plans to perform research or plans to participate in research in the future.'
3:::For mothers, change in diet quality was uniquely related to change in BMI (β = -0.12, p = 0.082), weight (β = -0.12, p = 0.060), and waist circumference (β = -0.38, p = 0.001), whereas change in caloric intake was related to waist circumference (β = 0.21, p = 0.002). For daughters, change in caloric intake was related to change in waist circumference (β = 0.12, p = 0.055). However, change in diet quality was not associated with weight-related outcomes in daughters. Additionally, change in exercise was not associated with weight-related outcomes in mothers or daughters.
3:::Median [interquartile range] age was 73 [64, 80]years. Coronary angiography was performed in 264 (98%) patients. Importantly, 75% and 89% underwent angiography within 24h and 72h after admission, respectively. Revascularization was done in 124 (79%). The all-cause, in-hospital mortality was 3.7% and was higher in patients aged ≥80years (8.5% vs. 2.0% in those aged <80years, p<0.0001). No patient developed major bleeding or stroke during hospitalization. Killip class IV at presentation (odds ratio [OR] 8.77, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.64-47.6) and left main trunk disease (OR 7.58, 95% CI 1.28-45.5) were independently associated with in-hospital death. These two variables and a high (≥140) GRACE score were associated with a higher 1-year mortality by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (p<0.0001).
3:::Questions 1, 9 and 11 were the most discriminatory and were combined to form the brief assessment tool. The ROC curve indicated an optimal threshold of 9. The diagnostic ability of the brief assessment tool among the remaining 46 participants from each group was: sensitivity 77% (95% CI: 67 to 84), specificity 66% (56-75), positive likelihood ratio 2.28 (1.66-3.13), and negative likelihood ratio 0.35 (0.23-0.53).
3:::Children with PA were significantly taller and more adipose than controls from the first years of life. 33% of children with PA presented the growth pattern of constitutional advancement of growth (ie, early growth acceleration) vs 19% of controls (P = .045). Children with PA had an earlier AR compared with controls; mean age at AR in girls with PA was 3.73 (1.03) years vs 4.93 (1.36) years for control girls (P = .001) and in boys with PA was 3.45 (0.73) vs 5.10 (1.50) years in control boys (P = .048). Both obese and nonobese girls with PA were taller and had earlier age at AR compared with nonobese controls.
3:::A final cohort of 195 patients was included in the analysis. Thirty (15%) patients received a total of 39 prehospital LSIs. Of these, 12 (40%) died. In total, 33 (17%) patients died. Of these, 21 (74%) did not receive prehospital LSIs. Model variables were field heart rate, lowest systolic blood pressure, shock index, pulse pressure, and GCS components. Using vital signs alone, ROC curves demonstrated poor prediction of LSI needs, mortality, and nonsurvivors who did not receive LSIs (area under the curve [AUC], AUCs: 0.72, 0.65, and 0.61). When using both vital signs and GCS, ROC curves still demonstrated poor prediction of nonsurvivors overall and nonsurvivors who did not receive LSIs (AUCs: 0.67, 0.74).
3:::The study population was 61 % female. At baseline, 39 % of patients were classified at WHO clinical stage 3 and 40 % at WHO clinical stage 4. Median age, body mass index and CD4 cells count were 41 years, 18kg/m(2) and 93 cells/μL, respectively. After a mean duration of 11.4 months of antiretroviral therapy, 85 % of patients received at least one prescription for a non-antiretroviral drug. Over the entire study period, the most frequently prescribed non-antiretroviral drugs were cotrimoxazole (78.9 % of patients), iron (33.2 %), vitamins (21.1 %) and antibiotics (19.6 %). The mean cost per patient was 34 Euros and the mean cost supported per patient was 14 Euros. The most expensive drugs per treated patient were antihypertensives (168 Euros), anti-ulcer agents (12 Euros), vitamins (8.5 Euros) and antihistamines (7 Euros). The prescription for a non-antiretroviral drug was associated with advanced clinical stage (WHO clinical stage 3/4 versus stage 1/2): OR=2.25; 95 % CI=1.11-4.57 and viral type (HIV-2 versus HIV-1/HIV-1+HIV-2): OR=0.36; 95 % CI=0.14-0.89.
3:::The median time from hospital arrival to cardiopulmonary bypass establishment was 115 minutes and has decreased over the last decade (trend test P < .001). We perfused the femoral artery in 615 patients (87.6%), placed aortic crossclamping in 616 patients (87.7%), and performed open distal anastomosis in all patients. The operative mortality was 5.4% (38/702), and the incidence of stroke was 10.8% (76/702). The 7-year overall survival and freedom from aortic reinterventions were 80.4% and 87.5%, respectively. Compared with the nonclamping group, the crossclamping group had a shorter operation time, similar operative mortality, incidence of stroke, and freedom from aortic reinterventions.
3:::49 patients were included. We found significant agreement (K=[0.5-0.92], p<0.001) and comparable accuracy (K=[0.36-0.38], p<0.02) and ghost images of radiographs and transparent 3D reconstructed CT without a difference in confidence (p=0.38).
3:::Twelve patients underwent USGTP. Median age at operation was 2.6years (IQR 0.9-5.3) and median weight 9.9kg (IQR 7.2-18.4). Median operative time was 27min. (IQR 20-44). First feeding occurred 8.8±2.9h after the procedure. The second patient in the series experienced the only operative complication. In this case, a linear probe was used with insufficient gastric distension, resulting in placement of the tube through a fold in the stomach wall. This was recognized and remedied intraoperatively. This prompted successful technique modification for future USGTPs. Only one patient was readmitted within 30days, and this was related to urinary retention, an underlying problem.
3:::Balloon dilation Eustachian tuboplasty resulted in significant improvements in 11 patients subjective but not objective outcome measures.'
3:::Overall, 188 patients with RAS-mutant tumours and 48 with BRAF-mutant tumours were identified. In BRAF-mutant patients, ORR was numerically higher in the cetuximab versus the bevacizumab arm (52% versus 40%), while comparable results were achieved for progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84, p = 0.56) and overall survival (OS; HR 0.79, p = 0.45). RAS mutation was associated with a trend towards lower ORR (37% versus 50.5%, p = 0.11) and shorter PFS (7.4 versus 9.7 months; HR 1.25; p = 0.14) in patients receiving FOLFIRI plus cetuximab versus bevacizumab, but OS was comparable (19.1 versus 20.1 months; HR 1.05; p = 0.73), respectively. ETS identified subgroups sensitive to cetuximab-based treatment in both BRAF- (9/17) and RAS-mutant (18/48) patients and was associated with significantly longer OS. DpR was comparable between both treatment arms in RAS- and BRAF-mutant patients, respectively.
3:::No significant difference was found in the leucocyte telomere length between controls and PCOS patients (0.99 ± 0.44 vs. 1.00 ± 0.38, p = 0.93). Interestingly, when comparing telomere length in granulosa cells between controls and PCOS subjects, significantly lengthened telomere length was found in PCOS subjects (1.00 ± 0.37 vs. 1.57±0.67, p < 0.0001). After adjustments for age and body mass index, the p value remained significant (p < 0.0001).
3:::HD showed more optimal decision making in the rGT. In the DRT, HD transiently showed reduced impulsive choice. In both LD and HD, alcohol treatment increased optimal decision making in the rGT and increased impulsive choice in the DRT. PCA prior to and after IAA was comparable for LD and HD. When PCA was tested after IAA only, HD showed a more sign-tracking behavior. The principal component analyses indicated dimensional relationships between alcohol intake, impulsivity, and sign-tracking behavior in the PCA task after IAA.
3:::CORT induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors as observed by increased immobility time in the tail suspension test and decreased sucrose consumption. MIRT or MIRT+ALA are effective in reversing anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors induced by CORT. CORT and MIRT alone prolonged sleeping time and this effect was reversed by MIRT+ALA. CORT significantly increased LP, which was reversed by MIRT or MIRT+ALA. Nitrite levels were increased in CORT-treated animals and reversed by MIRT+ALA200 (HC), MIRT or MIRT+ALA (ST).
3:::The most common symptoms of 17 patients with superior petrosal sinus related superior canal dehiscence syndrome were: hearing loss (53 per cent), aural fullness (47 per cent), pulsatile tinnitus (41 per cent) and pressure-induced vertigo (41 per cent). The diagnosis was made by demonstration of the characteristic bony groove of the superior petrosal sinus and the cookie bite' out of the superior semicircular canal on computed tomography imaging.'
3:::Of 187 patients, 171 (91.4%) achieved complete resection (R0) at OER. The rates of surgical mortality and severe morbidity were respectively 1.1 and 9.6%. Of the 187 patients, 73 (39%) had RC. Perineural invasion and/or lymphovascular invasion and T3 stage were associated with the presence of RC. In both countries, RC was associated with a significantly shorter median survival (23% vs not reached; p < 0.001) and lower 5-year DSS rate (19% vs. 74%; p < 0.001) despite R0 resection. In the multivariable analysis, RC was an independent poor predictor of DSS (hazard ratio [HR], 4.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.13-7.47; p < 0.001), as were lymphovascular and/or perineural invasion (HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.19-3.21; p = 0.008).
3:::In the study, we demonstrated that the expression of MEG3 was significantly down-regulated in breast cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Reducing MEG3 expression was significantly associated with TNM stage and lymph nodes metastasis in patients. Survival analysis showed that lower MEG3 predicted a poor DFS and OS for patients. In vitro, we showed that up-regulated MEG3 inhibited cell proliferation and cell invasion capacities. We further revealed that endogenous miR-421 expression was negatively regulated by MEG3 in breast cancer cells and MEG3 regulated E-cadherin expression by sponging to miR-421 in breast cancer cells.
3:::Both levetiracetam (25-100 mg/kg) and gabapentin (6.25-25 mg/kg) significantly reduced PBBI-induced seizure frequency by 44% to 73% and 61% to 69%, and seizure duration by 45% to 64% and 70% to 78%, respectively. However, the two drugs manifested different dose-response profiles. Levetiracetam attenuated seizure activity in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas the beneficial effects of gabapentin plateaued across the three highest doses tested. Combined administration of levetiracetam and gabapentin mirrored the more classic dose-response profile of levetiracetam monotherapy. However, no additional benefit was derived from the addition of gabapentin. Furthermore, isobolographic analysis of the combination dose-response profile of levetiracetam and gabapentin failed to reach the expected level of additivity, suggesting an unlikelihood of favorable interactions between these two drugs against spontaneously occurring posttraumatic seizure activities at the particular set of dose ratios tested.
3:::Between September 2012 and March 2016, 342 children with ARP or CP were enrolled; 129 (38%) were <6 years of age at the time of first diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, 111 (32%) were 6-11 years of age, and 102 (30%) were ≥12 years of age. Early-onset disease was associated with mutations in cationic trypsinogen (PRSS1) (P < .01), chymotrypsin C (CTRC) (P = .01), family history of acute pancreatitis (P = .02), family history of CP (P < .01), biliary cysts (P = .04), or chronic renal failure (P = .02). Later-onset disease was more commonly present with hypertriglyceridemia (P = .04), ulcerative colitis (P = .02), autoimmune diseases (P < .0001), or medication use (P < .01). Children with later-onset disease also were more likely to visit the emergency department (P < .05) or have diabetes (P < .01).
3:::After a median follow-up of 32.2 months (95% CI, 31.1-33.2 months), 3079/3219 patients (96%) had discontinued treatment. Adverse events (AEs) were largely consistent with previous reports; the most common all-grade treatment-related AEs were arthralgia (37%), alopecia (25%) and hyperkeratosis (23%); the most common grade 3/4 treatment-related AEs were squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (8%) and keratoacanthoma (8%). In the exploratory analysis, patients with DOR ≥12 months (n = 287) or ≥24 months (n = 133) were more likely to experience grade 3/4 AEs than the overall population. No new specific safety signals were observed with longer vemurafenib exposure.
3:::Seven patients underwent biembolization. All patients had right portal vein embolization (PVE) combined with right hepatic vein embolization (HVE, n = 4), median HVE (n = 2) and right + median HVE (n = 1). Three patients had preoperative liver disease and two received preoperative chemotherapy. No biembolization procedure-related complications occurred. The mean FLR regeneration rate was 52.6% (range: 18.2-187.9) after the biembolization. One patient with gallbladder carcinoma was not operated because of peritoneal carcinomatosis diagnosed after the biembolization. The remnant six patients did not develop postoperative liver failure.
3:::PolyVD (two or three affected vascular territories) was found in 3.0% of the participants, and was significantly higher in men (4.3%). Over a median follow-up of 4.1 years, we identified a total of 247 events (4.7%), including 83 strokes (68 ischemic), 45 MIs and 134 all-cause deaths. After adjusting for age, gender and other potential confounders, we found a significant increase in risk of major cardiovascular events as well as all-cause death in participants with polyVD. In multivariate Cox regression analyses, the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) (95% confidence interval, CI) for the composite of stroke, MI and all-cause death for single and poly-vascular disease (compared with 0 vascular disease) increased from 1.58 (1.19-2.12) to 1.95 (1.26-3.03). Similarly, the adjusted HR (95% CI) for all-cause death for single and poly-vascular disease increased from 1.53 (1.03-2.29) to 2.22 (1.27-3.86).
3:::In the sunbed intervention group (N = 31), a 27% increase of mean 25(OH)D levels was noted 1 week after starting sunbed use (P < .01). However, after 12 weeks, mean 25(OH)D levels had declined and were no longer different from baseline (P = .06). After 12 weeks, 25(OH)D levels did not differ between the intervention and control group (P = .36). Also the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index score did not differ between the sunbed and control groups (P = .19).
3:::There were 9260 interventions for VAAs from 2003 to 2013, including 5166 endovascular and 4094 open. Endovascular repairs increased from 5.3 to 24.7 per 10 million U.S. population (P < .001), surpassing open repairs in 2008, which decreased from 14.3 to 9.2 per 10 million (P < .001). Endovascular patients were more likely to have been treated at urban teaching hospitals (77.1% vs 61.8%; P < .0001); to have higher proportions of renal failure (7.6% vs 4.9%; P = .02), liver disease (11.3% vs 6.6%; P < .001), alcohol abuse (13.1% vs 3.6%; P < .001), chronic blood loss anemia (4.5% vs 1.6%; P < .001), metastatic cancer (2.7% vs 0.8%; P = .003), solid tumor without metastases (3.6% vs 2.0%; P < .037), and weight loss (9.8% vs 5.2%; P < .001); and less likely to have had elective admission (28.9% vs 59.8%; P < .0001). In-hospital mortality (4.1% vs 4.5%; P = .618) and overall complication rates (37.8% vs 38.8%; P = .688) were similar between groups; however, pulmonary complications were decreased for endovascular patients (10.6% vs 19.7%; P < .001). Endovascular patients had shorter hospital stays (6.5 vs 8.7 days; P < .001). Multivariate adjustment for mortality predictors, including coagulopathy (odds ratio [OR], 4.34; confidence interval [CI], 2.56-7.35; P < .001), liver disease (OR, 2.25; CI, 1.25-4.07; P = .01), fluid and electrolyte disorders (OR, 2.84; CI, 1.73-4.66; P < .001), and solid tumor without metastases (OR, 2.81; CI, 1.10-7.18; P = .03), showed that open treatment was associated with increased mortality (OR, 1.70; CI, 1.03-2.81; P = .04). Analysis of overall complications revealed that open treatment was again associated with increased complications (OR, 1.78; CI, 1.43-2.21; P < .001).
3:::Aorta PVAT density was significantly higher in SLE (mean (SD): (-83.6 (1.9) HU) versus HC (-84.1 (1.8) HU), p=0.03). Increasing aPVAT volume was correlated with denser aPVAT in SLE (ρ, p-value: 0.75,<0.0001) and HC (0.74,<0.0001). Increasing AC score (log) was correlated with denser aPVAT for SLE (0.31, 0.0005) and HC (0.23, 0.008). In linear regression, denser aPVAT was more strongly associated with AC score in SLE (β (SE): 0.445 (0.11), p<0.0001) versus HC (0.335 (0.12), p=0.006) independent of age, circulating inflammatory markers, CVD risk factors and BMI (p<0.05), but was attenuated with aPVAT volume (p=0.3).
3:::A total of 65.7% (185 439/282 225) of children with constipation had an index ED visit abdominal radiograph performed. Three-day revisits occurred in 3.7% (10 566/282 225) of children, and 0.28% (784/282 225) returned with a clinically important alternate related diagnosis. Appendicitis was the most common such revisit, accounting for 34.1% of all 3-day clinically important related revisits. Children who had an abdominal radiograph performed were more likely to have a 3-day revisit with a clinically important alternate related diagnosis (0.33% vs 0.17%; difference 0.17%; 95% CI 0.13-0.20). Following adjustment for covariates, abdominal radiograph performance was associated with a 3-day revisit with a clinically important alternate diagnosis (aOR: 1.39; 95% CI 1.15-1.67). Additional characteristics associated with the primary outcome included narcotic (aOR: 2.63) and antiemetic (aOR: 2.35) administration and underlying comorbidities (aOR: 2.52).
3:::Average parity of the sample was similar to that of the Western Cape population. Most women had one or two children (74%). Thirty-one percent of women had experienced a miscarriage and 19% had terminated a pregnancy. Almost all women (96%) attended at least one antenatal appointment during their pregnancies, and all deliveries occurred at a health facility. Women primarily relied on writing to communicate during antenatal visits and labor/delivery. The majority of women reported communication issues due to limited interpretation services, and some reported experiencing mistreatment from hospital staff.
3:::Results showed all four challenges successfully elicited high cognitive anxiety symptoms. Consistent with other laboratory challenge studies; high versus low ASCC participants reported comparable cognitive symptoms but reported significantly greater fear.
3:::In total, 767 CHF patients were enrolled to receive ivabradine twice daily, of whom 684 (90%) were still on ivabradine at study end (mean treatment duration 11.2months). The cohort was representative of CHF patients seen in clinical practice in terms of age, risk factor profile, and comorbidities. Concomitant beta-blocker therapy was prescribed in 497 patients (65%). After one year, compared to baseline, heart rate in ivabradine-treated patients was 16bpm lower. This reduction was associated with a significant improvement in NYHA class, and less frequent signs of decompensation (36% to 8%). The proportion of hospitalized patients within 1year decreased from 23% before treatment, to 5% with ivabradine therapy. These improvements in clinical status were accompanied by a reduction in BNP and an increase in LVEF (+5.1% at 1year). Quality of life was significantly improved in all measured dimensions. Adverse drug reactions were noted in 26 patients (3%), and were in line with the known safety profile of ivabradine.
3:::Ulcers were diagnosed in 166 subjects, including 83 complicated by bleeding or perforation. Age-, gender-, and socioeconomic status-adjusted associations were significant for mental vulnerability (Hazard Ratio (HR) 2.0, 95% Confidence Interval 1.4-2.8), Helicobacter pylori (HR 1.7, CI 1.2-2.3), smoking (HR 2.0, CI 1.3-3.1), heavy drinking (HR 1.6, CI 1.1-2.4), abstinence (HR 1.6, CI 1.1-2.5), non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (HR 2.1, CI 1.5-3.0), and sedentary lifestyle (HR 1.9, CI 1.4-2.7). Adjusted for all behavioral mediators, the HR for mental vulnerability was 1.5 (CI 1.0-2.2, p = .04). Mental vulnerability raised risk in Helicobacter pylori seropositive subjects and those exposed to neither Helicobacter pylori nor non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs; its impact was virtually unchanged when analysis was limited to complicated ulcers.
3:::There were 174 patients with uncomplicated diverticulosis and 175 patients with acute diverticulitis. A diagnosis of acute diverticulitis was associated with a significantly lower incidence of metformin use, than a diagnosis of uncomplicated diverticular disease (44% compared to 60%, respectively, p = .002). Other oral hypoglycaemic drugs and insulin were not associated with a lower incidence of diverticulitis (p = .12 and p = .24, respectively).
3:::As pain intensity, based on an 11-point scale (0, no pain; 10, worst pain), increased from 0 to 8.4 ± 0.9 (mean ± SD), CRM was not affected (81 ± 10% to 82 ± 13%). Before analgesia, CRM was 84 ± 10%. CRM at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, 50 minutes, and 60 minutes after analgesia was 82 ± 11%, 83 ± 14%, 83 ± 15%, 86 ± 12%, 89 ± 9%, and 87 ± 10%, respectively. There was a transient 2% reduction followed by a 5% increase in CRM from before to after epidural anesthesia (p = 0.048). Pain scores before and after analgesia were 7 ± 2 and 1 ± 1, respectively (p < 0.001).
3:::The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for GB surgery at two years exceeded $90,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained but decreased to $52,000, $29,000 and $22,000 when the health benefits of surgery were assumed to endure for 5, 10 and 15 years respectively. The cost-effectiveness of GB surgery was sensitive to utility gained from weight loss and, to a lesser degree, the costs of GB surgery. However, the cost-effectiveness of GB surgery was affected minimally by improvements in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure and cholesterol.
3:::Twenty one studies, including 11,524 adults were analyzed. Thirteen different novel therapeutic drug options were identified. Vedolizumab and golimumab were superior to placebo as induction and maintenance therapy. Tofacitinib showed dose related efficacy for induction therapy. Etrolizumab showed higher clinical remission rates compared to placebo. Phosphatidylcholine led to an improved clinical activity index. HMPL-004 may become a mesalamine alternative for mild to moderate UC. PF00547,659 was well tolerated. Statins were not beneficial for acute exacerbations of UC. Abatacept, rituximab and visilizumab did not lead to improved outcomes compared to placebo. Higher concentration of BMS 936557 was associated with improved efficacy compared to placebo. Basiliximab did not enhance corticosteroid efficacy.
3:::Mean age of patients was 50.5 (14.8) years, and 58.7% of them were female. Technical success rate of procedure was 91.3%. Mean procedure time was 81.8 (40.3) minutes. Early clinical improvement was observed in all patients with successful treatment. No serious adverse event related to procedure and mortality was observed. Mean follow-up time was 16.0 (7.9) months. Reocclusion was observed in 7 (17.5%) patients during the follow-up period. Venous patency rates of patients at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up visits were 95%, 92.5%, 89.7%, and 79.5%, respectively. Mild, moderate, and severe postthrombotic syndrome were observed in 8 (20%) patients, 4 (10%) patients, and 1 (2.5%) patient, respectively. Postthrombotic syndrome-free survival rate was 67.5%.
3:::IL-17 expression by CD8+ and γδ+ T cells was higher in BD compared to HC (p = 0.004, p = 0.003, respectively). No differences were observed between the groups in the IL-17 production by B cells. Under Th17-inducing conditions, production of IFN-γ by CD4+, CD8+, and γδ+ T cells was also higher in BD compared to HC (p < 0.05 in all).
3:::Ninety (65.2%) patients presented a TS of carotid origin and were included in group 1, and 48 (34.8%) of the 138 patients had a WS related to an SCS and were included in group 2. The median time between clinical onset of the cerebral ischemic event and surgery was 9 days (range: 0-89 days). Postoperative mortality was 0%. Seven (5.1%) patients had an aggravation of the neurological status during the postoperative period, of whom 2 presented a complete regression of the symptoms in less than 1 hour (definitive postoperative neurologic morbidity: 3.6%). Postoperative neurologic morbidity rate was significantly higher in the TS group (7 of 90; 7.8%) compared to the WS group (0 of 48; P = .04). No other independent predictive factor of neurologic morbidity after CEA for an SCS was found.
3:::Childhood ADHD, whether it remitted or persisted, was a pernicious risk factor for a limited number of poor outcomes, including low educational attainment, unplanned pregnancy, body mass index (BMI), and clinician-rated impairment. Childhood ADHD that persisted over time, whether completely or partially, was associated with a number of additional detrimental outcomes in the externalizing, internalizing, self-injury, occupational, social, and overall impairment domains. Finally, in this all-female sample, ADHD was not associated with objective measures of employment, substance use, or driving outcomes.
3:::Ezrin S66 phosphorylation enhanced the recruitment of ezrin to the membrane in ESCC cells. Additionally, non-phosphorylatable ezrin (S66A) significantly prevented filopodia formation, as well as caused a reduction in the number, length and lifetime of filopodia. Moreover, functional experiments revealed that expression of non-phosphorylatable ezrin (S66A) markedly suppressed migration and invasion but not proliferation of ESCC cells in vitro, and attenuated local invasion and regional lymph node metastasis, but not primary tumor growth of ESCC cells in vivo.
3:::HCV-RNA was successfully quantified with high reliability in liver biopsies, lymph nodes and ascitic fluid samples. Among the 17 untreated patients, a positive and significant HCV-RNA correlation between serum and NT liver-samples was observed (Pearson: rho=0.544, p=0.024). Three DAA-treated patients were HCV-RNA ""undetectable"" in serum, but still ""detectable"" in all tested liver-tissues. Differently, only one DAA-treated patient, tested after sustained-virological-response, showed HCV-RNA ""undetectability"" in liver-tissue.
3:::A significant reduction by 15% (P < 0.001) in CD16/CD56 NK cells was observed in CAD patients. Moreover, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), unstable angina (UA), and combined UA + NSTEMI group also showed a significant decline in NK cells compared with control individuals. CD16/CD56/CD3 TNK cells showed a significant reduction in CAD, NSTEMI, STEMI, and UA categories. However, UA + NSTEMI group did not show any significant change in TNK cells. On the other hand, the level of TNF-α was found to be significantly elevated in CAD, STEMI, and UA groups. NSTEMI and combined UA + NSTEMI group did not show any significant change in TNF-α level.
3:::An examination of trends in state firearm laws via this database revealed that although the number of laws nearly doubled during the study period, there was substantial heterogeneity across states, leading to a widening disparity in the number of firearm laws.
3:::Fifty-two patients received intranasal phenylephrine. Increases in blood pressure correlated with increasing plasma phenylephrine concentration. Systolic blood pressure increased 8%, and mean blood pressure increased 14%, which were statistically significant but clinically insignificant. Heart rate did not change, and the incidence of arrhythmia was low and similar among groups. Bleeding following nasotracheal intubation was less frequent in Group 3 (11/27 subjects) than in Group 1 (17/25). Peak plasma phenylephrine concentrations were observed by 14±7 minutes following intranasal administration, and were highly variable among individuals (37.8±39.7 and 49.6±93.9 ng/mL [mean±SD] in Groups 2 and 3).
3:::The serum leptin levels were significantly associated with TNBC severity, while the adiponectin levels were comparative. The serum leptin levels correlated inversely with the adiponetin levels. Serum leptin levels were unaffected with difference in parity. The difference in leptin levels in pre and post menopausal cases were found to be statistically non-significant. Higher leptin levels were also found to be associated obesity, mortality and recurrence. Obesity was found to be a factor for TNBC pathogenesis and severity. Increased Ob-R mRNA expression was associated with TNBC, significantly with TNBC severity, and was significantly higher in obese patients with higher grade TNBC cases. The Ob-R gene mRNA expression was significantly higher in the obese TNBC cases showing recurrence or mortality. The higher Ob-R gene mRNA expression correlated significantly with higher serum leptin levels and lower serum adiponectin levels in TNBC cases. The Ob-R mRNA expression with associated with modulation of CSC oct4 and nanog.
3:::A total of 147 NICU patients underwent VCUG during the study period. Of these, the indication for VCUG was UTI in 58 children. Neonates diagnosed with UTI were born at a mean gestational age of 28 3/7 ± 4 3/7 weeks, and underwent VCUG at a mean of age of 70.3 ± 42 days. Urine culture grew Enterococcus in 32 (55.2%), Enterobacter in 6 (10.3%), coagulase negative staphylococcus in 6 (10.3%), Escherichia coli in 5 (8.7%), and other in 9 infants (15.5%). All patients underwent a retroperitoneal ultrasound, which was read as normal in 31 patients (53.4%). Fourteen children (24.1%) diagnosed with UTI were found to have vesicoureteral reflux on VCUG. On univariate analysis, no patient characteristics were associated with VCUG positivity. On multivariate analysis, the effect of age at VCUG differed by renal-bladder ultrasound results. Patients with an abnormal ultrasound were 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.39-9.24) times more likely to have a positive VCUG for every 1 month increase in age.
3:::Over 14 years, 161 women delivered 217 HIV-exposed infants; 78 (36%) women received HCC. Two perinatal HIV transmissions (1.5%) occurred in HRC group compared with none in the HCC group (P = 0.3). Women in HCC were more likely to have HIV RNA viral load <1000 copies per milliliter at delivery (12% vs 26%, P = 0.02), have a contraception plan before delivery (93% vs 60%, P < 0.001), return for postpartum evaluation (80% vs 63%, P = 0.01), and have undetectable HIV viral load postpartum (50 copies per milliliter vs 2067, P < 0.0001).
3:::Alcohol treatment caused a high incidence of forelimb defects, particularly on the right side, that was higher in Shh(+/-) and Gli2(+/-) fetuses compared to wild-type fetuses. Dysmorphology scores were also significantly higher in the Shh(+/-) and Gli2(+/-) mice.
3:::IND-VFQ scores, on average, increased by 9.2 points from trial enrollment to 6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.9, 13.5, P = .0001). Although the SF-36 physical component summary score did not significantly differ over the course of the trial, the mental component summary score decreased by 2.3 points (95% CI: -4.4, -0.1, P = .04) and the vitality subscale decreased by 3.5 points (95% CI: -5.6, -1.4, P = .001). Quality-of-life scores did not differ between treatment arms. Linear regression modeling showed a 3.2-point improvement in IND-VFQ score for every 5-letter improvement in visual acuity (95% CI: 1.9, 4.3; P < .001).
3:::Interpersonal subtypes of vindictive and exploitable patients demonstrated pathoplasticity. Subtype did not predict working alliance trajectories; however, a significant interaction between interpersonal subtype and a quadratic effect for time demonstrated that exploitable patients with longer than average treatment lengths experienced attenuated symptom change over the course of treatment whereas vindictive patients appeared to demonstrate steady progress.
3:::1420 patients received an ICM, 753 (53%) in a procedure room and 667 (47%) in an electrophysiology laboratory. During a median follow-up of 499days, 9 (0.63%) and 15 (1.13%) patients experienced AEs with and without need for device explantation, respectively. In the 38 patients requiring device repositioning, more AEs requiring explantation were seen (3 (7.9%) vs. 6 (0.4%), p=0.001). Patients undergoing implantation in a procedure room had more infections (12 (1.6%) vs. 1 (0.1%), p=0.004), though no significant difference was reached in AEs requiring explantation (7 (0.9%) vs. 2 (0.3%), p=0.19).
3:::Across the three cohorts, there were 850,992 6-month observation periods, and 10,448 periods with at least one severe hypoglycemic event. The six-variable model contained age, diabetes type, HgbA1c, eGFR, history of a hypoglycemic event in the prior year, and insulin use. Both prediction models performed well, with good calibration and c-statistics of 0.84 and 0.81 for the 16-variable and 6-variable models, respectively. In the external validation cohorts, the c-statistics were 0.80-0.84.
3:::Repeated measure analyses of covariance revealed that greater age and MCI both significantly associated with slower gait speed, ps<.05. Follow-up analysis indicated that the MCI group had significantly slower dual-task gait speed but did not differ in simple-gait speed. Multivariate linear regression across groups found that executive attention performance accounted for 27.4% of the variance in dual-task gait speed beyond relevant demographic and health risk factors.
3:::Results suggested that the CT enhancement ratio had a strong correlation (y = 0.07245 + 0.09963x; r(2) = 0.898; p < 0.001) with the MBF ratio measured using the microsphere technique, whereas only moderate correlation (y = -1.5508 + 2.2684x; r(2) = 0.498; p < 0.001) was noted between the CT attenuation ratio and the MBF ratio measured using the microsphere technique. In ROC curve analysis, the AUC values of the CT enhancement ratio and the CT attenuation ratio were 0.927 and 0.829, respectively, with regard to the detection of significant ischemia during adenosine stress tests, as defined by the fractional flow reserve.
3:::The two approaches resulted equivalent with regard to the reproducibility and repeatability and showed a high degree of linearity in the dynamic range tested in the present study. Moreover, qPCR was able to quantify ≥10(5) copies per reaction, while the upper limit of ddPCR was 10(4) copies. There was not significant difference between viral load measured by the two methods The detection limit of both tests was 0,15 copies per reaction, however, the number of positive samples obtained by ddPCR was higher than that obtained by qPCR (45% and 37% respectively).
3:::There was an 11.0% to 16.7% relative increase in walking in the absence of airport construction where 580 to 810 more travelers per day chose to walk. Through May 2016, travelers completed 390 000 additional walking trips.
3:::Of 809 prospectively enrolled patients, 580 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pAF was ultimately diagnosed in 3.3% of the cohort (19 patients). SA and RA correctly diagnosed pAF in 17 patients resulting in a comparable diagnostic effectiveness of the analysis methods (sensitivity: SA 89.5% vs. RA 89.5%; specificity: SA 99.3% vs. RA 99.1%; κ, 0.686; P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.525-0.847). RA revealed clinically relevant ECG abnormalities in an additional seven patients.
3:::After PSM analysis, two well-balanced groups (548 pairs, total=1096) were generated. The baseline clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups. During the ACH test, compared with the non-ICS group, the ICS group had smaller spastic narrowing diameter (0.69±0.35 vs. 0.73±0.37, P=0.039) and incidence of ST-segment depression (4.0% vs. 0.9%, P=0.001). The incidence of primary and secondary endpoints was similar between the two groups up to 3years.
3:::The definition of Inappropriate admissions' near the end of life incorporated system factors, social and family factors. The prevalence of inappropriate admissions ranged widely depending largely on non-clinical reasons: poor availability of alternative sites of care or failure of preventive actions by other healthcare providers (1.7-67.0%); family requests (up to 10.5%); or too late an admission to be of benefit (1.7-35.0%). The widespread use of subjective parameters not routinely collected in practice, and the inclusion of non-clinical factors precluded the true estimation of clinical inappropriateness.'
3:::In all 3 patients, there was no additional opioid consumption during the first 24h after the block. Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain was less than 6 for the first 24h. Women were all very satisfied with the quality of pain relief.
3:::Our study included 2136 patients with IBD (1197 Crohns disease, 939 ulcerative colitis), among which just over half were women (52%), and the mean age was 41 years. The mean distance from our hospital was 2.5, 8.8, 22.0, and 50.8 miles for the first (most proximal) through fourth (most distant), respectively. We observed a statistically significant and meaningful higher risk among patients in the most distant quartile in the need for immunomodulator use (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.29-2.22), biological therapy (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.69-2.85), and surgery (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.80-3.32). Differences remained significant on multivariable analysis and by type of IBD.'
3:::We reported that tDCS induced long-lasting antidepressant-like effect, which varied as a function of stimulation settings including number, duration, intensity and polarity of stimulation. Interestingly, the present study also demonstrated that tDCS reduced depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic corticosterone exposure. Furthermore, behavioral outcomes induced by a single stimulation were associated with neuronal activation in the prefrontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens, whereas no overexpression of c-fos was associated with 10 stimulations.
3:::Between January 2011 and July 2012, a total of 75 patients underwent hemi-thyroidectomy with ipsilateral central lymph node dissection via SIET. The mean tumor size was 0.5 cm and 4.1 ± 2.43 central lymph nodes were removed. Of the patients, 98.3% were satisfied with their surgical wound post-operatively and no critical post-operative complications occurred during the study, except for one case of post-operative bleeding. There was one case of disease recurrence, which occurred in the contra-lateral cervical lymph node region 6 months after SIET. This patient underwent completion thyroidectomy with selective neck dissection.
3:::Brain tissue Let-7i and miR-21 increased at 4 hours and 1 day, whereas miR-124a and miR-107 were enhanced only 1 day post-injury. MiR-146a displayed a biphasic response and increased 1 day and 7 days, whereas elevation of miR-21 was sustained 1 day to 7 days after PBBI. Pathway analysis indicated that miRNAs were linked to inflammatory proteins, IL-6 and IL-1beta. Confirmation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that both cytokines were increased and peaked at 1 day, but fell at 3 days through 7 days after PBBI, indicating an inverse relationship with miRNA abundance. Serum Let-7i, alone, was differentially abundant 7 days after PBBI.
3:::16/29 (55%) patients had three distinct patterns of osseous abnormality, not significantly differing between cohorts. Non-indolent disease was more likely to present with hepatomegaly (p=0.0004), splenomegaly (p=0.0097), and lymphadenopathy (p=0.0079). CT, was the most common initial imaging modality, ordered to stage disease in 20 of 29 patients (69%).
3:::Ex vivo, similar amounts of bone mass fashioned adjacent cross sections. Larger distal cross sections had thinner porous cortices of lower matrix mineral density (MMD), a larger medullary CSA and higher trabecular density. Smaller proximal cross-sections had thicker less porous cortices of higher MMD, a small medullary canal with little trabecular bone. Taller persons had more distally positioned fixed ROIs which moved proximally when corrected. Shorter persons had more proximally positioned fixed ROIs which moved distally when corrected, so dimorphisms lessened. In the corrected ROIs, in Caucasians, women had 0.6 SD higher porosity and 0.6 SD lower trabecular density than men (p<0.01). In Asians, women had 0.25 SD higher porosity (NS) and 0.5 SD lower trabecular density than men (p<0.05). In women, Asians had 0.8 SD lower porosity and 0.3 SD higher trabecular density than Caucasians (p<0.01). In men, Asians and Caucasians had similar porosity and trabecular density. Results were similar using an adjusted fixed ROI. Adjusting for secular effects of age on forearm length resulted in the age-related increment in porosity increasing from 2.08 SD to 2.48 SD (p<0.05).
3:::Among 443 patients, 52.6% received surgical resection alone, 18.7% received S+CT, and 28.6% received S+CRT. Significantly more adenocarcinoma patients received adjuvant treatment (50.8%) than squamous cell carcinoma patients (27.7%, p = 0.001). On multivariable analysis, S+CT (hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.91; p = 0.014) and S+CRT (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence interval,. 0.55 to 0.98; p = 0.038) both were associated with significantly increased overall survival. These findings persisted among margin-negative patients. However, in margin-positive patients, S+CRT (hazard ratio, 0.29; p = 0.002) was the only treatment arm that was associated with significantly improved survival compared with surgical resection alone.
3:::Data from 36 studies (n =15734) met the inclusion criteria and were analysed under a random effects model. Nearly all included studies utilised the Composite Scale of Morningness (CSM) or the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) as a measure of chronotype. Overall effect size from 58 effect sizes was small (z=-.20; 95% CI: -.18 to -.23). Effect sizes based on the CSM were significantly larger than those based on the MEQ. There was no evidence of publication bias.
3:::Aa-EE reduced NO production up to 60% without any cytotoxicity. This extract was found to downregulate the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory genes. Aa-EE blocked NF-κB promoter activity induced by both TNF-α and adaptor molecule MyD88 (about 70% and 40%, respectively). Moreover, nuclear translocation of p65 and IκBα phosphorylation were also inhibited. Furthermore, Aa-EE inactivated two upstream signaling molecules, the Src and Syk kinases. In accordance with these data, the kinase activities of Src and Syk were decreased by 50% and 80%, respectively. The anti-inflammatory action of Aa-EE was also confirmed in a gastritis model.
3:::Phosphoenolpuryvate (PEP) correlated with the grade of inflammation (r = 0.746, p = .005) and thromboplastin time (r = 0.592, p = .043). It also differentiated patients with active inflammation from patients without (t = 3.781, p = .009). There was no correlation between PEP and aminotransferase or immunoglobulin G levels. The phosphoethanolamine (PE)/phosphocholine (PC) ratio, PE/glyserophosphoethanolamine (GPE) ratio and PC/[total phosphomonoester (PME) + phosphodiester (PDE)] ratios correlated with immunoglobulin G (r = 0.764, p = .006; r = 0.618, p = .043; and r= -0.636, p = .035, respectively). PME/PDE and PE/GPE correlated with fibrosis (r = 0.668, p = .018 and r = 0.604, p = .037). PE/GPE also differentiated F3 from F0-2 patients (t = 3.810, p = .003). Phosphorus metabolites did not correlate with TE results and TE did not correlate with liver histology or laboratory parameters.
3:::Targeted PVs within the MW ablation zone exhibited thrombosis at a significantly higher rate than HVs (54.5% vs 0.0%; P = .0046). There was a negligible change in intravascular temperature in PVs and HVs during the ablation procedure (0.2°C ± 0.4 vs 0.6°C ± 0.9; P = .46). PVs exhibited significantly higher gene expression than HVs in terms of fold differences in thrombomodulin (2.9 ± 2.0; P = .0001), von Willebrand factor (vWF; 7.6 ± 1.5; P = .0001), endothelial protein C receptor (3.50 ± 0.49; P = .0011), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (1.46 ± 0.05; P = .0014). Western blot analysis showed significantly higher expression of vWF (2.32 ± 0.92; P = .031) in PVs compared with HVs.
3:::FS significantly decreased the body weight loss, colon length shortening, and tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 elevations induced by colitis compared with the negative control (P < 0.05). Moreover, FS improved the colitis-induced histopathological damage to the colon, including epithelial necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, ulceration, and submucosal edema. In phytochemical analyses, 7 flavonoids, 9 lignans, 13 phenolics, and 2 triterpenes were identified by comparison with the retention times and mass fragmentations of authentic standards.
3:::We showed that the chronic treatment of RV at both doses reduced vascular lipid accumulation (~50%, p<0.05), probably through systemic and hepatic antioxidant effects, independent of dyslipidemia. Moreover, the in vitro assay results demonstrated that RV develops antioxidant properties on the vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells, reinforcing the protective role of RV in progression of AT. LPS-stimulated macrophages treated with RV resulted in a significant reduction of NO production in a concentration-dependent manner.
3:::Older adults were at higher risk for mortality [HR (95%CI)=4.54 (3.73-5.52)] when two or more of the following components were present: poor physical performance, low muscle mass, poor lung function, and anemia. If anemia was combined with high C-reactive protein (CRP) and high B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was added the HR (95%CI) was slightly higher (5.81 (4.73-7.14)) even after adjusting for age, sex and comorbidities. Our models were validated in an external population of adults 80+. The extended model had a better predictive capacity for cardiovascular mortality [HR (95%CI)=5.05 (2.23-11.44)] compared to the baseline model [HR (95%CI)=2.17 (1.18-4.00)] in the external population.
3:::The quick and basic profile is the most prevalent. While available admission summaries are associated with quick and basic use, lab and imaging results are associated with slower or deeper use. Physicians who are the first to use the system or are sole users during an encounter are less inclined to quick and deep use. These effects are intensified for experts.
3:::In vivo and in vitro Nod2 in hematopoietic cells regulates epithelial paracellular permeability through cytokine production influencing myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) activity. Indeed, tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ secretion by CD4 T cells upregulated expression and activity of epithelial MLCK leading to increased epithelial tight junction opening. When stimulated by muramyl dipeptide, Nod2 in the nonhematopoietic compartment normalized the permeability and T-cell cytokine secretion and regulated MLCK activity. This MLCK regulation is mediated by TAK1 and RICK-dependent mechanisms.
3:::Our findings in the mania vs euthymia cohort comparison were replicated in the longitudinal analysis. Bipolar mania was differentiated from euthymia by decreased connectivity between the amygdala and pre-genual anterior cingulate cortex. Mania was also characterized by increased connectivity between amygdala and the supplemental motor area, a region normally anti-correlated to the amygdala in emotion regulation tasks.
3:::A 5-month-old Indian girl born to healthy non-consanguineous parents presented at the third week of life with irritability, sterile multifocal osteomyelitis including ribs and clavicles, a mild pustular rash, and elevated acute phase reactants. SNP array of the patients genomic DNA revealed a previously unrecognized homozygous deletion of approximately 22.5 Kb. PCR and Sanger sequencing of the borders of the deleted area allowed identification of the breakpoints of the deletion, thus confirming a homozygous 22,216 bp deletion that spans the first four exons of IL1RN. Due to a clinical suspicion of DIRA, anakinra was initiated which resulted in an anaphylactic reaction that triggered desensitization with subsequent marked and sustained clinical and laboratory improvement.'
3:::We identified 6,026 index trauma admissions, with 158 (2.6%) unplanned readmissions within 30 days of discharge. The most common reasons for readmission were disease/symptom progression (30.2%), wound complications (28.9%), and pain control (11.8%). On multivariate analysis, only Injury Severity Score (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.05; p=0.016), penetrating injuries (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.12-3.24; p=0.018), and smoking (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.05-2.86; p=0.031) were found to be significant. Hospital length of stay, insurance status, and race were not significant.
3:::Among THC-positive blood samples, 76% also tested positive for CBD. There was a strong correlation between THC- and CBD concentrations in blood samples (Pearsons r=0.714, p<0.0005). Subjects judged as impaired by a CTI had significantly higher THC- (p<0.001) and CBD (p=0.008) concentrations compared with not impaired subjects, but after multivariate analyses, impairment could only be related to THC concentration (p=0.004). Analyzing seizures revealed THC/CBD ratios of 2:1 for hashish and 200:1 for marijuana.'
3:::Condylar subchondral bone loss and increased osteoclastic activities were observed in both juvenile and adult AMO groups, while increased osteoblastic activities were only seen in the juvenile AMO group. Decreased bone mineral density, bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness, but increased trabecular separation, number and surface of osteoclasts and mRNA levels of TRAP, cathepsin-K, RANKL in the juvenile AMO group were all reversed after molar extraction (all P<0.05). However, these parameters showed no difference between adult AMO and extraction groups (all P>0.05).
3:::The results stated that Huangkui capsule significantly inhibited the elevation of Scr, BUN, UP, the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), phosphorylation-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK1/2), NADPH Oxidase 1, NADPH Oxidase 2 and NADPH Oxidase 4 in adenine-induced CRF rats. The main bioactive components of quercetin (QT), hyperoside (HY), isoquercitrin (IQT), gossypetin-8-O-β-D-glucuronide (GG) and quercetin-3-O-glucoside (QG) at the dosage of 100µM, like NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium, exhibited a significant effect on inhibiting the expression of α-SMA, p-ERK1/2, NADPH Oxidase 1, NADPH Oxidase 2 and NADPH Oxidase 4 in high glucose-induced HK-2 cells, especially GG.'
3:::Patient encounters of 61 women and 31 men (mean age, 41.2 years) met the inclusion criteria. In 48 of 92 (52.2%) cases where the radiology report suggested a demyelinating diagnosis, the patient was also given such a diagnosis as the final outcome. Where a demyelinating disorder was placed as the only, first, second, or third (or later) differential diagnosis, the final diagnosis was concordant with demyelination in 84.3% (43/51), 37.5% (3/8), 18.2% (2/11), and 0% (0/22) of cases, respectively (p < 0.01).
3:::The majority of patients had stage IE disease (76.5%; 39 of 51). With advancing stage, patients were more likely to have respiratory and B symptoms and higher International Prognostic Index scores. The most common treatment modality was surgical resection in low-stage patients (33 of 43) and chemotherapy in high-stage patients (7 of 8). At a median follow-up of 40.7 months, progression-free survival was longer for low-stage patients (median, 40.7 months vs 24.9 months; P < .001), and high-stage patients were 9.2 times more likely to progress (hazard ratio, 9.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.93-44.36). Among 30 patients with surgically resected stage IE disease, 8 with central lesions were treated via lobectomy and 22 with peripheral lesions were treated via lobectomy (n = 8) or limited resection (n = 14). One of these patients, with a central lesion, experienced disease recurrence.
3:::All compounds inhibited the growth of microorganisms, being more effective against P. falciparum after 72 h of incubation, especially for the compounds 1 (IC50 = 3.2 μg/mL) and 5 (IC50 = 6.6 μg/mL), than to L. amazonensis (compound 1 = 179.0 μg/mL; compound 5 = 106.0 μg/mL). Despite all compounds reducing the viability of peritoneal cells, the SI were <10 to L. amazonensis, whereas in the cultures of P. falciparum the SI >10 for the piplartine (>37.4) and cinnamides 4 (>10.7) and 5 (= 38.4).
3:::The mean number of different bacterial genera was 5.0 in both controls and OAB patients (p=0.99). The uropathogenic bacteria Proteus (P=0.01) was more commonly isolated from women with OAB. The genus lactobacillus was present less commonly in urine from OAB patients when compared to urine taken from controls (p=0.02). Overall the most commonly grown bacteria were staphylococcus (grown in 59% of samples), streptococccus (51%), corynebacterium (37%) and lactobacillus (28%). A total of 95 different genera were identified from the urine samples.
3:::Reconstructed patients were younger and had lower clinical stage disease. Reconstruction did not significantly increase the mean time to PMRT initiation (51 days reconstructed vs. 45 days non-reconstructed, p = 0.14) or the number of patients who initiated PMRT within 12 weeks of the last therapeutic intervention (48/50 [96.0] vs. 61/66 [92.4%], p = 0.41). There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients in whom the internal mammary lymph nodes (IMNs) were targeted (72 vs. 80%, p = 0.29) or in IMN target coverage (mean IMN V40.5 Gy 92.6 vs. 94.1%, p = 0.62). Reconstruction did not significantly affect the mean ipsilateral lung V20 (25.4 vs. 26.4%, p = 0.37) or the mean heart dose (2.2 vs. 2.1 Gy, p = 0.63).
3:::Mean APB and DPB were 54.69° and 55.35mm, respectively. Females had a significantly higher mean APB than males (57.29° vs. 52.41°; p<0.001), whereas males had a significant larger mean DPB (59.13mm vs. 51.03mm; p<0.001). Age had no effect on the mean APB. Mean width of the pubic body at the base was 9.38mm.
3:::With use of the MS/MS GAA assay in DBS, 96% of the pseudodeficiency newborns and all of the Pompe disease carriers were well separated from the IOPD and LOPD newborns. The fluorimetric assay separated <10% of the pseudodeficiencies from the IOPD/LOPD group.
3:::Six hundred and eleven-(71%) children were referred to the burns or the intensive care unit and 253 children were treated and discharged from the trauma unit. Of those admitted as inpatients 94% fulfilled at least one of the criteria for referral and 80% of those treated and discharged fulfilled the criteria for referral.
3:::The outcome dental visits' was significantly correlated with SEP, especially with monetary dimensions, such as income and economic resources for unforeseen expenditures. However, educational level was not a significant predictor in the tested statistical models. Furthermore, other covariates that contributed significantly to the models were ethnicity, dental anxiety and lifestyle factors, albeit with a different pattern of impact on the two outcome dimensions. Important features of the SEP variables were the stepwise gradient relative to the outcomes, implicating that the lower the SEP status, the greater the risk of reporting irregular dental visiting habits and refraining from dental care due to financial problems.'
3:::65% of the patients treated with AZA and 61% of the patients treated with MP tolerated their treatment during 12 months (i.e., no group difference, p = 0.742). No difference in reported side effects between the two treatments was observed. The mean equivalent initial dose (0.92 vs. 0.61 mg/kg; p < 0.001) and the mean equivalent dose at 12 months (1.98 vs. 1.65 mg/kg; p = 0.014) was significantly higher in the MP group vs. the AZA group. The proportion of patients with ΔMCV ≥ 7 at 12 months was numerically higher in the MP group than in the AZA group (53% vs. 31%; p = 0.090).
3:::Arsenic in drinking water was associated with increased odds of VLBW (AOR 1.14 per µg/L increase; 95% CI 1.04, 1.24) and PTB (AOR 1.10; 95% CI 1.06, 1.15) among singleton births in counties where <10% of the population used private wells. No significant association was observed between arsenic and SGA, or VPTB, but a suggestive association was observed between arsenic and term LBW.
3:::Within the first 10 min, the proportional intracellular enrichment of unbound carfilzomib was higher (313 nM; 62.6%) for the exposure to 500 nM compared to 10 nM (1.93 nM; 19.3%). However, after 1 h, an intracellular/extracellular concentration equilibrium was reached with both settings. At low exposure concentrations, drug removal after 1 h diminished carfilzomib efficacy. Moreover, proteasomal activity recovered when exposed to 10 nM for 48 h. However, when exposure concentration was high (500 nM) proteasome inhibition was complete and sustained even with drug removal after 1 h.
3:::After the micronization process, the particle sizes of the raw materials significantly decreased. X-ray and DSC results indicated that although ciprofloxacin showed no changes in its crystal structure, the structure of levofloxacin became amorphous after the micronization process. FT-IR spectra exhibited the characteristic peaks for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin in all formulations. The dissolution rates of micro-homogenized and spray-dried ciprofloxacin were higher than that of untreated ciprofloxacin. ACI results showed that all formulations had a mass median aerodynamic diameter less than 5 μm; however, levofloxacin microparticles showed higher respirability than ciprofloxacin powders did. The permeability of levofloxacin was higher than those of the ciprofloxacin formulations.
3:::Of 34,574 respondents, 24,030 (69.5%) who had heard of HIV were included in this analysis. Community-level HIV stigmatizing attitudes and disclosure concerns were associated with higher odds of self-reported STDs (adjusted odds ratio = 2.07; 95% confidence interval: 1.55 to 2.77; adjusted odds ratio = 2.95; 95% confidence interval: 1.51 to 5.58). Compared with men, community-level HIV stigmatizing attitudes among women were a stronger driver of self-reported STDs (interaction P = 0.07). Gender modified the association between community-level HIV disclosure concerns and both recent and consistent condom usage (interaction P = 0.03 and P = 0.002, respectively). Community-level HIV disclosure concerns among women were observed to be a driver of risky sex and self-reported STDs.
3:::Structural-functional analysis demonstrated that the haptoglobin β subunit recapitulates the HMGB1-binding properties of full-length haptoglobin. Similar to HMGB1-haptoglobin complexes, the HMGB1-haptoglobin β complexes also elicited anti-inflammatory effects via CD163-mediated IL-10 release and heme oxygenase-1 expression. Treatment with haptoglobin β protein conferred significant protection in mouse models of polymicrobial sepsis as well as acetaminophen-induced liver injury, two HMGB1-dependent inflammatory conditions.
3:::RYGB rats displayed reduced HFD intake relative to controls. Sham and RYGB rats consumed more alcohol and preferred lower concentrations of alcohol, whereas only RYGB rats escalated alcohol intake during acute withdrawal. Remarkably, GHSR activity, independent of peripheral ghrelin release, set the tonic firing of VTA DA neurons, a response selectively diminished in RYGB rats.
3:::AtDCS at 2 mA, but not 1 mA, significantly increased cortical excitability at the group level in all sessions. The overall ICC revealed fair to high reliability of tDCS effects for multiple sessions. Given that the distribution of responses showed important variability in the sham condition, we established a Sham Variability-Based Threshold to classify responses and to track individual changes across sessions. Using this threshold an intra-individual consistent response pattern was then observed only for the 2 mA condition.
3:::A total of 600 ACS patients (71.1% male, mean age 60 years) were enrolled; 599 were included for analysis. Diagnosis comprised STEMI (n = 375, 62.6%), NSTEMI (n = 147, 24.5%), and unstable angina (UA) (n = 77, 12.9%). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was conducted in 64.3% of patients with STEMI (with or without thrombolysis), 36.7% with NSTEMI, and 58.4% with UA. There was undertreatment with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for STEMI, NSTEMI, and UA: 14.7%, 25.9% and 16.9% of patients, respectively, were not receiving DAPT during hospitalization, and 10.1%, 21.8% and 16.9% at discharge. Post-discharge, of the STEMI group, only 72.4% of patients who were managed by PCI and 39.8% of conservatively treated patients received DAPT at 12 months. The respective figures in the NSTEMI group were 77.3% and 26.4%. In the STEMI cohort the cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was 3.2% at 1 year and 5.1% at 2 years of follow-up; in the NSTEMI cohort this was 2.7% and 4.8%, respectively. There were no deaths by 12 months and one death by 24 months (1.3%) in the UA population.
3:::Compared to WT mice, TLR4 KO mice showed reduced preference for lipids, sugars, and umami in a two-bottle preference test. The altered taste perception was associated with decreased levels of key taste regulatory molecules in the tongue epithelium. TLR4 KO mice on a high-fat and high-sugar diet consumed less food and drink, resulting in diminished weight gain.
3:::Among the 190 cases eligible for study (n = 91 pre-target and n = 99 post-target), no significant difference was found in time to CT scan pre- and post-target: least squares mean (LSM) with 95% confidence interval = 68 (56-81) versus 65 (53-78) min, respectively, P = 0.66. Time to neurosurgery (LSM 8.7 (5-15) vs. 5.1 (2.6-9.9) h, P = 0.19, or hospital length of stay (LSM: 4.9 (3.9-6.3) vs. 5.2 (4.1-6.7) days, P = 0.69) did not change significantly. However, ED length of stay decreased by 45 min in the post-target period (LSM = 211 (187-238) vs. 166 (98-160) min, P = 0.006).
3:::Based on the results of the MVPA, the local FCD value in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) can differentiate depression patients from schizophrenia patients. The patients with depression had a higher local FCD value in the medial and anterior parts of the OFC than the subjects in the other two groups, which suggested altered abstract and reward reinforces processing in depression patients. Subsequent functional connectivity analysis indicated that the connection in the prefrontal cortex was significantly lower in people with schizophrenia compared to people with depression and healthy controls.
3:::Three different cutting levels on the mandible permitted an accurate resection based on the intraoperative needs. The corresponding 3 ""cutting levels"" on the fibula created perfectly matching segments of vascularized bone. Good contact of bony segments was obtained in all patients.
3:::In Europe in 2010, the cost of managing osteoporosis was estimated at €37 billion and notably the costs of treatment and long-term care of patients with fractures were considerably higher than the costs for pharmacological prevention. Despite the availability of effective treatments, the uptake of osteoporosis therapy is low and declining, in particular for secondary fracture prevention where the risk of a subsequent fracture following a first fracture is high. Consequently, there is a significant treatment gap between those who would benefit from treatment and those who receive it, which urgently needs to be addressed so that the burden of disease can be reduced.
3:::EG reported statistically significant higher scores on the four aspects measured than CG (p<0.05; Mann-Whitney U tests; Cohens d standardized effect size d1=0.30; d2=1.05; d3=0.39; d4=0.49).'
3:::The median age was 22years (IQR=13-34years), and 48.4% of the sample had diabetes less than six years. The median HbA1c was 8.5% (69mmol/mol) (IQR 7.2-10.5%), with significant regional variance (p=0.002). Insulin treatment was predominantly two injections/day (45% of patients). The highest incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis was 14.4 events/100 patient years among adolescents. Of the 57.3% of patients with LDL-C>2.6mmol/L, only 11.2% received treatment. Of the 10.6% considered hypertensive, 47.1% received treatment. Rates of documented screening for retinopathy, nephropathy, and peripheral neuropathy were 35.2%, 42.3%, and 25.0%, respectively. The median number of days of self-monitoring/week was 3.0 (IQR=1.0-7.0). There were significant differences in care practices across regions.
3:::There were 134 patients in the fragment excision group, 78 patients in the fragment preservation group, and 9 patients in the chondral defect grafting group. In the fragment excision group, the cumulative incidence of osteoarthritis was 12.0% at 5 years, 17.0% at 10 years, 26.0% at 15 years, 39.0% at 20 years, and 70% at 30 years. The cumulative incidence of arthroplasty was 2.0% at 5 years, 4.0% at 10 years, 4.0% at 15 years, 10.0% at 20 years, and 32.0% at 30 years. In the fragment preservation group, the cumulative incidence of osteoarthritis was 3.0% at 5 years, 7.0% at 10 years, 16.0% at 15 years, 25.0% at 20 years, and 51% at 30 years. The cumulative incidence of arthroplasty was 0.0% at 5 years, 0.0% at 10 years, 3.0% at 15 years, 6.0% at 20 years, and 11.0% at 30 years. No patients in the chondral defect grafting group developed osteoarthritis or underwent arthroplasty. Body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 kg/m(2) (hazard ratio [HR] 3.3; 95% CI, 1.6-7.0), older age at diagnosis (HR 4.9; 95% CI, 1.8-17.3), and fragment excision (HR 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.6) were predictive of osteoarthritis.
3:::The clinical endpoint was the recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia. Among these 3 groups, higher percentages of male (93.6%, P<0.001), NPV triggers (44.7%, P<0.001), longer AF duration (6.65±6.72years, P=0.029), larger left atrium diameter (44.44±6.79mm, P<0.001), and longer procedure time (181.94±70.02min, P<0.001) were noted in LSPAF. After the first catheter ablation, the recurrence rate of AF was highest in LSPAF (Log Rank, P<0.001). Larger left atrium diameters (LAD) (P=0.006; HR: 1.063; CI: 1.018-1.111) and NPV triggers (P=0.035; HR: 1.707; 1.037-2.809) independently predicted AF recurrence in LSPAF.
3:::From 1990 to 2013, overall mortality was declined by almost two-thirds among 81 292 children (10 588 deaths). Mortality was 51% (95% ci: 45-58%) higher in the rainy season than in the dry season throughout the study period. The seasonal difference increased significantly with age, the r/d-mrr being 0.94 (0.86-1.03) among neonates, 1.57 (1.46-1.69) in post-neonatal infants and 1.83 (1.72-1.95) in under-five children (P for same effect <0.001). According to the InterVa, malaria deaths were the main reason for the seasonal mortality difference, causing 50% of all deaths in the rainy season, but only if the InterVa included season of death, making the argument self-confirmatory.
3:::MDD patients had significant alterations in the network involving ""theory of mind"" regions, such as the left precentral gyrus, left angular gyrus, bilateral rolandic operculums and left inferior frontal gyrus. The center node of significant network was the left angular gyrus. No significant correlations of functional connectivity within the subnetwork and clinical parameters were noted.
3:::The microdeletion harbors the NHS, SCLML1, and RAI2 genes and results in a phenotype consistent with NSH syndrome and developmental delay.
3:::There was no association between CYP3A polymorphisms and cord mercury concentrations. The scores for the BSID mental scale improved with increasing cord blood mercury concentrations for carriers of the most active alleles (β[95% CI]:=2.9[1.53,4.27] for CYP3A7 rs2257401 GG+GC, 2.51[1.04,3.98] for CYP3A5 rs776746 AA+AG and 2.31[0.12,4.50] for CYP3A4 rs2740574 GG+AG). This association was near the null for CYP3A7 CC, CYP3A5 GG and CYP3A4 AA genotypes. The interaction between the CYP3A genes and total mercury was significant (p<0.05) in European cohorts only.
3:::At first study the misclassification error rates, compared to reference diagnoses, were: 15.3% for sparse LDA, 30% for our criteria, 45% for Rajaballys and 48% for Hadden's. Sparse LDA identified seven most powerful electrophysiological variables differentiating demyelinating and axonal subtypes and assigned to each patient the diagnostic probability of belonging to either subtype. At second study 46.6% of axonal GBS patients showed RCF in two motor and 8.8% in two sensory nerves.'
3:::The regression of TRP/Ccr on 1/(EP/Ccr) was significant. The horizontal limb of the derived hyperbola commenced at FEP ≍ 20% and depicted stable P reabsorption at FEP > 20%.
3:::Of 11 patients identified with thrombosis on axial SWI, high-resolution coronal SWI verified bridging vein thrombosis in four individuals (36%). The previously reported ""tadpole sign"" on axial images did not predict bridging vein thrombosis on coronal SWI (odds ratio = 0.3 [0.02, 5.01], P = 0.538). Volumetric coronal SWI disclosed additional irregularities of the bridging vein walls which was associated with the presence of subdural hematoma on magnetic resonance imaging (P = 0.03), suggesting traumatic injury.
3:::Over a median time of 21 years, dementia developed in 1,105 participants. Among persons with diabetes, each 5 μg/mL decrease in 1,5-AG increased the estimated risk of dementia by 16% (hazard ratio 1.16, P = 0.032). For cognitive decline among participants with diabetes and HbA1c <7% (53 mmol/mol), those with glucose peaks had a 0.19 greater z score decline over 20 years (P = 0.162) compared with those without peaks. Among participants with diabetes and HbA1c ≥7% (53 mmol/mol), those with glucose peaks had a 0.38 greater z score decline compared with persons without glucose peaks (P < 0.001). We found no significant associations in persons without diabetes.
3:::Fifteen miRNAs were differentially expressed when comparing autoantibody-positive/negative siblings (range -2.5 to 1.3-fold). But receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated low specificity and sensitivity. Seven additional miRNAs were differentially expressed among autoantibody-positive relatives according to disease progression; ROC returned significant AUC values and identified miRNA cut-off levels associated with an increased risk of disease in both cross-sectional and survival analyses. Levels of several miRNAs showed significant correlations (r values range 0.22-0.55) with OGTT outcomes. miR-21-3p, miR-29a-3p and miR-424-5p had the most robust associations.
3:::Body mass index was significantly lower in female HF patients than in male counterparts (20.0±4.2 in female vs 25.2±3.8 in male, p=0.04). In female HF patients, both mature myostatin and pSmad2 were significantly up-regulated by 1.9 fold (p=0.05) and 2.5 fold (p<0.01) respectively compared to female donors, while expression of pSmad2 was increased by 2.8 times in male HF patients compared to male healthy subjects, but that of myostatin was not. There was no significant difference in protein expression related to myostatin signaling between male and female patients.
3:::Subretinal fluid (SRF) was completely resolved in 74% (37/50 eyes) at month 3. Mean BCVA (LogMAR) was improved from 0.44 ± 0.29 at baseline to 0.37 ± 0.32 at month 3 (p = 0.001). MMT was decreased from 335.0 ± 99.8 μm at baseline to 236.4 ± 66.4 μm after 3 months (p < 0.001). SRF height was decreased from 168.0 ± 77.3 μm at baseline to 29.0 ± 57.3 μm after 3 months (p < 0.001). However, the changes in SCT were not statistically significant (p = 0.48).
3:::Among 10 212 included patients, 4030 patients (39.5%) received HFX and 6182 patients (60.5%) received CFX. Predictors for receipt of HFX included clinical T1 disease, recent year of diagnosis, and treatment at academic and higher-volume centers (all P < .001). Patients treated with HFX increased from 22.1% in 2004 to 58.0% in 2013. HFX was associated with improved OS compared with CFX on univariate (five-year OS = 77.1%, 95% CI = 75.2% to 78.8%, vs 73.5%, 95% CI = 72.1% to 74.8%, respectively, log-rank P < .001) and multivariable analysis (HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.81 to 0.98, P = .02), a finding confirmed on propensity score matching.
3:::A total of 853 patients (49.7% female) with a mean age of 12.1 ± 3.7 years were included. Anthropometric data were normal. Mean diabetes duration was 8 ± 3.4 years. Mean outpatient follow-up was 4.7 ± 0.04 visits/year. Twenty-five per cent were on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Mean HbA1c was 7.3 ± 1% (56 ± 8 mmol/mol) and 66.6% had HbA1c < 7.5% (58 mmol/mol). HbA1c value correlated negatively with age at onset and positively with years of diabetes, number of visits/year and current age (F = 7.06; p = 0.01). Patients on CSII (n = 213) were younger, attended the outpatient clinic more frequently, were diagnosed earlier, had better metabolic control and had presented more severe hypoglycaemic episodes the previous year. The rate of severe decompensation (episodes/100 patients/year) was ketoacidosis 1.5 and severe hypoglycaemia 4.5. The prevalence of chronic complications was very low.
3:::Each arm showed statistically significant changes in kidney norepinephrine (NE, ng/g) between treated kidneys vs. untreated contralateral control. There were no statistically significant differences in tissue NE% reductions across each arm based on catheter, anatomic location, & number of lesions (p=0.563): EN8 -74±34%, EN12 -95±3%, SP8 -76±16%, SP12 -82±17% (p=0.496). A total of 46 lesions were measured for lesion depth: EN main (3.3±2.8mm) vs. SP branch (2.0±1.0mm, p=0.039), SP main (2.9±1.6mm) vs. SP branch (p=0.052), and EN main vs. SP main (p=0.337).
3:::All of the tested retraction products exhibited some antimicrobial activity. The results of the most active products were comparable with those of a marketed mouthwash. The listed retraction-active agents displayed relatively little activity when tested in pure form. At 10% dilution, some products evidenced inhibitory activity against most tested bacteria within 3 minutes of exposure, whereas others displayed variable effects after 10 minutes. The most active agents reduced, but did not completely prevent, the metabolic activity of a monospecies biofilm.
3:::Participants had on average 8 (SD 6) years of training experience and 1RM of 1.25 (SD 0.28) kg per kg bodyweight. Focusing on using pectoralis major increased activity in this muscle by 9% nEMG (95% CI 5-13; Cohens d 0.60) compared with the regular condition. Triceps activity was not significantly influenced by triceps focus although borderline significant, with a mean difference of 5% nEMG (95% CI 0-10; Cohen's d 0.30). However, years of training experience was positively associated with the ability to selectively activate the triceps (β = 0.41, P = 0.04), but not the pectoralis. Bench press 1RM was not significantly associated with the ability to selectively activate the muscles.'
3:::Sensitivities were 38/44 (86%), 40/44 (91%), and 15/44 (34%), and the cost ratio was 1:9.4:3.8 for MEPM-SMA-DDST:Etest MP/MPI:MAST-CDS, respectively. The specificity was 11/11 (100%) for all assays. MEPM-SMA-DDST detected IMP-producing isolates with high sensitivity (38/40; 95%), but the assay was inadequate for NDM-producing isolates (0/4; 0%). The Etest MP/MPI detected both IMP- (36/40; 90%) and NDM-producing isolates (4/4; 100%), but was the most expensive. MAST-CDS detected IMP-producing isolates with low sensitivity (11/40; 28%), but the assay worked well for NDM-producing isolates (4/4; 100%).
3:::Twenty nine re-operations were performed at a mean follow-up of 16 ± 11.7 months (0.2-36 months). The prosthesis was removed in 18 cases and retained in 11. There was a significant difference in mean time to re-intervention between the implant removal and preservation groups, 23.1 ± 8.3 months (7-36 months) and 4.4 ± 4.7 months (0.2-13 months), respectively (p < 0.001). The primary reason for surgical re-intervention was painful loosening (13 cases). Radio-capitellar instability was the most frequent reason for re-intervention with implant retention (5 cases). Midterm quickDASH and MEPS after surgical re-intervention with implant retention were 15.4 ± 5.4 and 82.27 ± 7.3, respectively. At least one degenerative lesion was reported in nine cases (81.8%) (i.e. 5 periprosthetic osteolysis, 5 capitellar wear, 5 periarticular heterotopic ossification).
3:::In pharmacokinetic studies, the bioavailability of acacetin in FVB mice was 1.3%. Acacetin was mostly exposed as acacetin glucuronides in plasma. AUC of acacetin-7-glucuronide (Aca-7-Glu) was 2-fold and 6-fold higher in Bcrp1 (-/-) mice and Mrp2 (-/-) mice, respectively. AUC of acacetin-5-glucuronide (Aca-5-Glu) was 2-fold higher in Bcrp1 (-/-) mice. In mouse intestinal perfusion, the excretion of Aca-7-Glu was decreased by 1-fold and 2-fold in Bcrp1 (-/-) and Mrp2 (-/-) mice, respectively. In Caco-2 cells, the efflux rates of Aca-7-Glu and Aca-5-Glu were significantly decreased by breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitor Ko143 and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) inhibitor LTC4. The use of these inhibitors markedly increased the intracellular acacetin glucuronide content.
3:::In total, 59.0% of day 5 SET cycles resulted in a clinical pregnancy compared to 54.1% of day 6 blastocysts (p = 0.54). Ongoing pregnancy rates from day 5 frozen-thawed blastocysts (51.7%) were comparable to day 6 (44.9%, p = 0.14). When looking at vitrified blastocysts only, there were no significant differences between day 5 and day 6 blastocysts, with a clinical pregnancy rate of 69.2% for day 5 and 72.5% for day 6 (p = 0.68).
3:::The combination of ECT with pharmacotherapy was associated with a decrease of IL-6 and an increase of TNF-α. Depressive inpatients, as a whole group, had a decrease of IL-6 and an increase of IFN-γ. No significant results were found for IL-2, IL-4, Il-10 and IL-17.
3:::A clear decreasing trend in the SMR of PCa patients was evident when pre- and post-PSA eras were compared: for localized PCa, the SMR was 1.43 (95%CI 1.38-1.48) in 1985-1989 and 0.98 (95%CI 0.95-1.01) in 2000-2004, and for metastasized PCa, the SMRs were 4.51 (95%CI 4.30-4.72) and 3.01 (95%CI 2.89-3.12), respectively. Difference between cause-specific and relative survival was pronounced in localized PCa in post-PSA period: 10-year relative survival was 94.6% (95%CI 91.4-97.8) and cause-specific 84.2% (95%CI 82.9-85.5%). In metastasized PCa the difference was not that significant.
3:::Thirty-one implants in 26 patients were reviewed. A total of 73 postoperative radiographs were reviewed. The mean age of the study subjects was 58 years. The mean radiographic follow-up was 13 months (range: 1-56). All arthroplasties were performed for osteoarthritis. Only one repeat surgery was performed. There was good agreement amongst readers with regard to radiographic interpretation, but the strength of agreement between radiographic loosening and adverse clinical outcome was poor. The sensitivity of radiography in predicting an adverse clinical outcome was 63%, specificity 65%, positive predictive value 39%, and negative predictive value 83%.
3:::At baseline, 67 patients showed capillaroscopic normal pattern (CNP) and 15 patients, of which 11 were very early SSc, had capillaroscopic scleroderma pattern (CSP). Plasma levels of t-PA, vWF and IL-6 were higher in patients with CNP (p=0.0001) than in HS and even much higher in patients with CSP (p=0.0001). In patients with CNP and RP of recent onset (<18months), vWF plasma levels were higher when autoantibodies were present (p=0.020). After 36months, among 48 RP patients with CNP who remained in follow-up, 24 were diagnosed as primary and 24 as secondary RP. In secondary RP, basal levels of t-PA, IL-6 and particularly vWF were higher than in primary RP (p=0.005, p=0.004, p=0.0001 respectively) and HS (p=0.0001 for all).
3:::Currently, less than 12% of waivers include any kind of sexuality services, and those services provided are predominantly reactive, rather than proactive. Reactive services focused on interrupting sexually inappropriate behaviors through assessments and plans, intervention and therapy, and supervision. Meanwhile, proactive services promoted the healthy sexuality of people with IDD by providing sexuality education related to sexuality awareness, reproduction, and victimization avoidance.
3:::Average age of patients was 7.5 years. Fracture distribution was tuft (37%), mallet (18%), Salter-Harris I/II (13%), shaft (11%), base (11%), Seymour (6%), Salter-Harris III/IV (2%), and tip amputation (1%). Complications occurred in 31% of patients. The highest rates were for Salter-Harris IV (100%), Seymour (62%), and mallet fractures (49%). There was a statistically significant difference in complication rate by diagnosis. The most common complications were infection (22%), stiffness (15%), and nail deformity (13%).
3:::Fifteen (94%) of the loaded FSUs have decreased MRI signal in the growth zone of the superior vertebra and 12 (75%) in the inferior vertebrae. Fourteen (88%) FSUs have increased signal in the superior vertebral body. Fourteen (88%) FSUs have a reduced signal in all or any endplate. The histology morphometry displayed that the unstained parts of the epiphyseal growth zone were larger among the loaded FSUs (mean 29% vs 4%) and that the chondrocytes in the endplate and growth zones had abnormal structure and deformed extracellular matrix.
3:::21,357 patients were included. Average age was 67.0±11.0years, 48.9% were men, and 35.8% were from low SES. Good medication persistence rates for ARBs were 78.8%, ACEI 69.0%, statins 66.6%, acarbose 67.8%, metformin 58.6%, and glibenclamide 55.3%. Good persistence to any of the medications tested was associated with a higher rate of good persistence to other medications. Patients who took more medications had better persistence rates.
3:::102 hemiarthroplasty patients were admitted to the orthopedic ward and 117 to the geriatric ward. Patients characteristics, including age, living arrangements, mobility status and the Charlson Comorbidity Index were similar between groups. Patients from the orthopedic ward had shorter hospitalization time (9±5.1 vs. 10.8±6.7days, p=0.022) and presented a lower in-hospital complication rates (0.6±0.96 vs. 1±1.9, p=0.022), namely fewer events of urinary retentions, urinary tract infections and pneumonias (8.8% vs. 23.9%, p=0.004, 3.9% vs. 14.5%, p=0.010 and 2.9% vs. 12.2%, p=0.034, respectfully). Readmission rates were similar. Neither in hospital nor one year mortality rates differed between groups.'
3:::Dorsal sural SNAPs were recordable bilaterally from 49 healthy volunteers. Mean peak-to-peak amplitude for SNAPs was 12.9±6.3μV, and mean nerve conduction velocity was 44.8±5.5m/s. The mean amplitude of SNAPs obtained by our method was 118.6% higher than that of SNAPs obtained by the conventional method (12.9μVvs. 5.9μV; P<0.001).
3:::Mean subject age was 15.3±2.2 years; 11 subjects were girls (39%). We observed decreases in mean length of disease involvement (12.0±5.4 vs. 9.1±5.3 cm, P=0.02), maximum bowel wall thickness (5.6±1.8 vs. 4.7±1.7 mm, P=0.02), bowel wall color Doppler signal (1.7±0.9 vs. 1.2±0.8, P=0.002) and mesenteric color Doppler signal (1.1±0.9 vs. 0.6±0.6, P=0.005) at approximately 2 weeks following the initiation of infliximab compared to baseline. All laboratory inflammatory markers decreased at 1 month (P-values<0.0001). There was strong correlation between bowel wall color Doppler signal and fecal calprotectin (ρ=0.710; P<0.0001). Linear mixed models confirmed that maximum bowel wall thickness (P=0.04), length of disease involvement (P=0.0002) and bowel wall color Doppler signal (P<0.0001) change over time in response to infliximab, when adjusted for age, sex, azathioprine therapy, scanning radiologist and baseline short pediatric Crohns disease activity index score.'
3:::The patients mean age was 60.3 ± 9.2 years and 60% were female. Disease duration was 5.7 ± 3.7 years. Autofluorescence imaging showed punctiform hyper-FAF spots in 23 out of the 29 eyes (79%), which was significantly associated with a greater visual field mean deviation (-7 ± 7 versus -3 ± 2 dB, p = 0.04). Hypo-FAF was defined as peripapillary (n = 25; 86.2%), macular (n = 10; 34.5%), lichenoid (n = 17; 58.6%), and/or diffuse (n = 13; 44.8%). Lichenoid hypo-FAF was significantly associated with worse VA (0.18 ± 0.24 vs. 0.05 ± 0.07 LogMAR, p = 0.04). Macular hypo-FAF was associated with a history of macular edema (62.5%; p = 0.06). Diffuse hypo-FAF was observed more frequently (p = 0.01) in chronic disease (66.7%) than in active (0%) or quiescent disease (27.3%).'
3:::The static TT-TG distance measured with the knee in full extension cannot accurately predict dynamic lateral displacement of the patella. There was weak predictive ability among subjects with patellofemoral pain ( r(2) = 0.18, P = .02) and no predictive capability among controls. Among subjects with patellofemoral pain and static TT-TG distances 15 mm or more, 8 of 13 subjects (62%) demonstrated neutral or medial patellar tracking patterns.
3:::Thrombin and protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) agonist induced TGF-β1 activation and Smad3 phosphorylation. Pretreatment with TGF-β-neutralizing antibody completely inhibited thrombin-induced CCN2 synthesis. Neutralizing antibodies to integrin αv, β1, αvβ3, αvβ5, and Rho-associated coiled-coil forming protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y27632 completely blocked thrombin-induced TGF-β1 activation, Smad3 phosphorylation, and CCN2 synthesis. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) dose-dependently inhibited thrombin-induced TGF-β1 activation.
3:::Parental height dimorphism was statistically significantly associated with same-sex parent-offspring height differences (father-son: mean Δ = 3.88 cm, β = -71.47 ± 11.49 SE, t = -6.22, p ≤ .0005; mother-daughter: mean Δ = 4.15 cm, β = 80.46 ± 18.52 SE, t = 4.35, p ≤ .0005). Adjusted mean father-son differences increased significantly across grandfathers occupation categories (Privileged, Δ = 0.60, Business, Δ = 4.06, Farming & Labor, Δ = 5.28; p = .011). Mother-daughter differences were substantial, from 3.33 cm to 5.06 cm, but did not differ significantly across occupational categories (p = .63).'
3:::Compared with CTA O-O maximum sinuses diameter, the best correlation and agreement were obtained using the TTE SAX mid-diastolic L-L method (ρ = 0.89, 2.6 ± 2.3 mm, respectively). Compared with CTA O-O maximum Asc-Ao diameter, the TTE LAX systolic L-L method (ρ = 0.93, 1.3 ± 2.5 mm) was best. Compared with CTA I-I maximum sinuses diameter, the TTE SAX mid-diastole L-L method (ρ = 0.95, 0.6 ± 2.2 mm) was unbiased. Compared with CTA I-I maximum Asc-Ao diameter, the TTE LAX end-diastolic L-L method (ρ = 0.95, 0.6 ± 2.4 mm) was unbiased.
3:::A para-sulcal CL was detected which showed hypointense rim and iso- to hyperintense core. This was detected in the proximity of the leptomeninges in the left precentral gyrus extending to the adjacent postcentral gyrus.
3:::At baseline, 99 (65.6%) of the 151 eyes showed inferior mGCIPL loss. In addition, 112 eyes (74.2%) and 5 eyes (3.3%) showed inferoinferior pRNFL defect and pRNFL defect in the MVZ, respectively. At the 3-year follow-up, 112 (74.2%) of the eyes showed inferior mGCIPL loss, whereas 123 eyes (81.5%) and 25 eyes (16.6%) showed inferoinferior pRNFL defect and pRNFL defect in the MVZ, respectively. Ninety-four eyes initially showed inferior mGCIPL loss without pRNFL defect in the MVZ; among them, 19 (20.2%) subsequently showed defect during the 3-year follow-up interval. Meanwhile, among the 52 eyes without preexisting inferior mGCIPL loss, only 1 (1.9%; P < 0.001) developed a pRNFL defect in the MVZ during the 3-year follow-up interval.
3:::Sex differences became evident between 8.5 and 10.0 years of age. Thereafter, female growth velocities declined, while males showed increased growth velocities until 10.0-14.5 years across dimensions. Body dimensions varied in growth; females and males reached 98% of maximum body length at 11.7 and 13.1 years, respectively. Females attained 95.3% of maximum body length by mean age at first birth. Neonates were 31% of maternal size, and doubled in size by mean weaning age. Males reached maximum body and arm length and back width before emigration, but experienced continued growth in head dimensions.
3:::One hundred and four Group D eyes (92 patients) presented to our center during the study period, of which 32 (27 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Following IVC (vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin), adjuvant treatments included intraophthalmic artery chemotherapy in 5 (16%) eyes, plaque brachytherapy in 5 (16%), transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) in 18 (56%), and cryotherapy in 24 (75%) eyes. On last examination, 64.41 ± 6.76 months from presentation, mean final VA was 20/283 (logMAR equivalent of 1.15 ± 0.15). On univariate analysis, presentation age, foveal retinoblastoma (at initial examination), use of TTT, and tumor-foveola distance (at last visit) were found to be significant risk factors for worse VA (P < .026). On multivariate analysis, however, only TTT was found to be significant (P = .010). At last visit, 6 of 27 (22%) patients had nystagmus and 12 of 20 (60%) bilaterally salvaged patients had strabismus (n = 10 exotropia and n = 2 esotropia).
3:::Historical data revealed a mean referral to disposition time for patients with ATC of 8.7 days before our intervention. After the intervention, the mean referral to disposition time was reduced to 0.5 days. Participation in treatment trials for all patients with ATC was 34%.
3:::Four hundred and fifty-one patients responded (response rate 65%). Most patients thought that accessing doctors notes online was a good idea (95%), wanted to view their clinic notes online (94%), and agreed online access would increase their understanding of their eye problems (95%) and help them better remember their care plan (94%); 14% said online access would increase their worry; 43% had privacy concerns; and 96% indicated they would show or discuss their notes with at least one other person. Non-white patients were more likely than white patients to perceive online clinic notes as a useful tool, but they were also more likely to worry and to express greater privacy concerns.'
3:::Most common related AEs included immediate post-injection reaction or injection site pruritus reactions, somnolence and opioid overdoses. Adjusted analysis indicated that participants in the hydromorphone group were less likely to have any related AE or SAE compared to the diacetylmorphine group. Related somnolence and opioid overdose events were distributed throughout the six months treatment period. In the diacetylmorphine group, five of the eleven related SAE opioid overdoses (requiring naloxone) occurred in the first 30days since most recent treatment initiation. Analysis of somnolence and opioid overdose (AEs and SAEs) event rates by received dose suggested a non-linear relationship. However, in the diacetylmorphine group higher event rates per person days were recorded at lower doses.
3:::On univariate and multivariate analysis, perineural invasion (PNI) was found to be an independent adverse risk factor. Patients with PNI-positive disease had significantly worse 2-year disease-free survival (DFS), locoregional failure free survival, and overall survival (OS) as compared to patients with PNI-negative disease (P < 0. 001, 0.001 and < 0. 001) respectively.
3:::For the diagnosis of malignancy an S value of 60% was obtained, which means that 40% of malignant tumors were not diagnosed by FNA. Besides an E value of 97.5% was obtained, thus indicating that FNA was negative for malignancy in up to 97.5% of all benign neoplasms. According to predictive values, we observe that FNA hit in 83.3% cases given as malignant and in 92% of cases giving as benign (PPV=83,3%; NPV=92%).
3:::Overall, 32 and 29 panelists participated in the first and second rounds of the Delphi panel, respectively. Consensus was reached on treatment and HRU associated with a typical pacemaker implantation and complications. HRU was similar across regions, except for Japan, where panelists reported the longest duration of hospital stay in all scenarios. Infections were the most resource-intensive complications and were characterized by intravenous antibiotics days of 9.6?13.5 days and 21.3?29.2 days for pocket and lead infections respectively; laboratory and diagnostic tests, and system extraction and replacement procedures. DVT, on the other hand, was the least resource intensive complication.
3:::The urgency distribution of the CSs was 11%, 52%, and 37% in Crash, < 30-min, and > 30-min urgency categories respectively. Increased BMI was associated with longer DDI time in the < 30-min urgency category (33(13-176) vs. 38(18-118) min; P < 0.05 for BMI < 30 and > 35 group respectively). Regional anesthesia failures (new regional anesthesia, conversion to general anesthesia, or complaint of pain during surgery) took place in 3.7%, 6.8%, and 8.5% in the BMI < 30, 30-35, and > 35 groups respectively (P = 0.021). Epidural top-up resulted in shorter DDI and time delay between arrival at the operating room and skin incision across all urgency and BMI groups than combined spinal epidural (CSE) anesthesia.
3:::After covariate adjustment, ΣDAP concentrations were not associated with SRS scores [β=-1.2; 95% confidence interval (CI): -4.0, 1.6]. Among children with the PON1-108TT genotype, ΣDAP concentrations were associated with 2.5-point higher (95% CI: -4.9, 9.8) SRS scores; however, the association was not different from the 1.8-point decrease (95% CI: -5.8, 2.2) among children with PON1-108CT/CC genotypes (ΣDAP × PON1-108 p-value =0.54). The association between ΣDAP concentrations and SRS scores was not modified by PON1192 (ΣDAP × PON1192 p-value =0.89).
3:::Two hundred and two participants (with 202 masses) who underwent RN or PN were included; 37% of the masses were indolent. The predictive performances of the nomogram revealed areas under the curve of 0.866 for masses of all cases and 0.808 for cT1 masses without visible fat. DCA revealed that the nomogram was moderately clinically useful. The calibration plots showed a reasonable calibration and systematic overestimation of indolent disease based on nomogram predictions.
3:::This meta-analysis included 17 eligible studies meeting Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium consisting of 4864 patients with T2DM(cases) and 8779 people without diabetes(controls). All models had no heterogeneity or publication bias in the meta-analysis including all subjects. ADRB3 rs4994 polymorphism of all subjects was significantly associated with an increased risk of T2DM in all genetic models with random effects: AG(OR=1.18, 95% CI: 1.05-1.32), RG(OR=1.76, 95% CI: 1.27-2.42), DG(OR=1.16, 95% CI: 1.03-1.30), HMG (OR=1.78, 95% CI: 1.25-2.52), and HTG(OR=1.11, 95% CI: 1.01-1.23). Furthermore, in sub-group analysis all models except HTG exhibited significant associations between T2DM and ADRB3 in Asians. However, the non-Asian group had no significant association in any genetic models with random effects.
3:::KA, TCA, and PCA averaged 1.06 (±0.85) D, 1.05 (±0.83) D, and 0.33 (±0.17) D. The error of the model to estimate TCA averaged zero with an SD of ±0.21 D. Application of this model and of direct Pentacam TCA measurements in TIOL calculation gave similar results, namely a slight reduction of overcorrection in with-the-rule astigmatism, but an eradication of undercorrection in against-the-rule astigmatism.
3:::In patients with snapping scapulae, observer 1 did not find any Luschka tubercles, whereas observer 2 detected one; in the control group both observers found two Luschka tubercles (p > 0.49). One scapular osteochondroma was found in the group with snapping scapulae. No further abnormalities of the rib cage or periscapular soft tissues were found in that group. The superior angle of the scapula was significantly thicker in the snapping scapula group compared with the control group (4.8 ± 1.3 mm vs 4.0 ± 1.0 mm, p < 0.012). The subscapular fossa was significantly deeper in patients with snapping scapula than in control group subjects (25.7 ± 5.2 mm vs 21.8 ± 5.0 mm, p < 0.005). The remaining parameters did not differ significantly between the groups.
3:::Less than half of the programs highly implemented CMT, MAT, and culturally competent practices. CMT and cultural competence were not associated with successful treatment completion. However, Mexican Americans in programs with high degree of implementation of MAT had higher odds of successfully completing treatment compared to non-Latino Whites and programs with low MAT (OR=1.389; 95% CI=1.018, 1.897).
3:::Each patient received lung transplantation at an average age of 11 months (range, 5-15 months). All patients had pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and escalating levels of ventilator support before transplantation. All 6 patients survived initial lung transplantation; however, 1 patient died after a subsequent heart-lung transplant. The remaining 5 patients are living unrestricted lives on chronic immunosuppression at most recent follow-up (range, 19 months to 11.3 years post-transplantation). However, in all patients, severe ascending aortic dilation has been observed with aortic regurgitation.
3:::One hundred and forty patients were included and allocated into 2 groups that were comparable in demographic characteristics, surgical intervention type and anesthesia duration. Comparison of these two groups regarding the hemodynamic profile found more stability in group M for systolic arterial blood pressure. A calm recovery was more often noted in group M (77.1% versus 44%, p < 10(-3)). The average Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score was lower in the intervention group (33.8 ± 13.63 versus 45.1 ± 16.2; p < 10(-3)). The satisfaction rate was significantly higher among the experimental group (81.4% versus 51.4%; p < 10(-3)). The incidence of intraoperative awareness was higher in group C (8 cases versus 3 cases) but the difference was not statistically significant.
3:::In three distinct datasets spanning 684 samples, RANK mRNA expression was higher in primary tumors derived from TNBC patients than from those with other molecular subtypes (P < 0.01). Cell surface-localized RANK protein was consistently higher in TNBC cell lines (P = 0.037). In clinical samples, TNBC patients that expressed both RANK and RANKL proteins had significantly worse RFS (P = 0.0032) and OS (P = 0.004) than patients with RANK-positive, RANKL-negative tumors. RANKL was an independent, poor prognostic factor for RFS (P = 0.04) and OS (P = 0.01) in multivariate analysis in samples that expressed both RANK and RANKL.
3:::Aspirin-only prophylaxis was administered to 7.5% of patients after knee arthroplasty and 8.0% after hip arthroplasty. Post-operative VTE was diagnosed in 2217 (0.96%) patients after knee arthroplasty and 454 (0.41%) after hip arthroplasty. Compared to anticoagulants, aspirin was not associated with a higher risk for post-operative VTE either after knee arthroplasty (adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval [OR] 0.34 [0.24-0.48]) or hip arthroplasty (OR 0.82 [0.45-1.51]).
3:::Internal consistency of the ISEL was high (α=0.95). Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that most of the ISEL items loaded strongly (>0.45) on the original 4 factors. Mean ISEL score was 68.1, which indicated lower social support than population norms. ISEL scores were significantly but modestly negatively correlated with grief severity. ISEL total scores also varied by sociodemographic and clinical variables; never being married, depression or anxiety diagnosis, and living alone were all associated with lower ISEL scores.
3:::Ninety patients were matched into 45 pairs. There was significant improvement (P = .039) in locoregional control with PORT (84%) compared with surgery alone (60%), which was concentrated in the pN1 subgroup (P = .036), but not the pN0 subgroup (P = .331).
3:::In an independent validation cohort, we show that patients with indolent breast cancer had 100% breast cancer-specific survival at 15 years of follow-up.
3:::Clinically significant cancer was found in 87.4% (159/182) of patients. The cutoff PI-RADSv2 score for clinically significant cancer was 4 for readers 1 and 2 and 5 for reader 3. The AUCs were 0.829 and 0.853 for readers 1 and 2 (p < 0.001) and 0.602 for reader 3 (p = 0.067). For reader 1, sensitivity was 89.9% (143/159); specificity, 69.6% (16/23); positive predictive value, 95.3% (143/150); negative predictive value, 50.0% (16/32); and accuracy, 87.4% (159/182). The corresponding values for reader 2 were 81.1% (129/159), 82.6% (19/23), 97.0% (129/133), 38.8% (19/49), and 81.3% (148/182). For the experienced readers, 66.7-81.3% of patients with false-negative results had clinically significant cancers with tumor volume less than 1 cm(3).
3:::Compared with placebo, drug treatment resulted in delaying the development of hypertension by nearly 12years and reducing the absolute incidence of hypertension by 32.01% over lifetime. The cumulative incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure were reduced and survival was improved from 28.46 to 28.80years. The average incremental cost effectiveness ratio for drug treatment was $12,994 per quality-adjusted life-year and the value was mostly sensitive to the effect size of treatment and age starting treatment. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of >3×China gross domestic product per capita in 2014, there was a 30.48% chance that drug treatment would remain cost-effective and a low chance of being cost-effective if relative risk of treatment on hypertension was larger than 0.64.
3:::Logistic regression analysis found that the interaction of CMR and distress tolerance was significant in predicting substance abuse treatment retention. Higher score on CMR was significantly associated with increased likelihood of treatment retention in substance users with higher distress tolerance, but not in substance users with lower distress tolerance.
3:::Activation of the left frontal subcallosal gyrus in response to Cr was greater in smokers than in non-smokers. Smokers showed less activation in the right temporal lobe in response to Av than did non-smokers. Brain activation in response to Cr in the left frontal subcallosal gyrus was positively correlated with Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) scores in smokers. Brain activation in response to Av in the right temporal lobe was negatively correlated with the Korean Version of the Cognitive Avoidance Questionnaire (KCAQ) scores in non-smokers.
3:::We found that miR-372 expression was significantly lower in ovarian carcinoma than normal ovarian tissues and benign tumors. Moreover, miR-372 overexpression showed significant inhibition of cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. Western Blot revealed that miR-372 downregulated the expression of ATAD2, LATS2, P62, DKK1 and cyclinA1 to inhibit the proliferation of cells.
3:::The proteolytically activated forms of MMPs were not observed in the analyzed sera. Serum activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 did not statistically differ between patients with micro and macroadenomas. The analysis of material obtained from tissue of microadenomas showed slightly lower activities of both forms of MMP-9 (pro-MMP-9 and MMP-9/lipokalin heterodimer). Simultaneously the increased activity of pro-MMP-2 in comparison to macroadenomas was observed. Although differences observed did not reach statistical significance, only in the case of microadenomas the presence of the active form of MMP-2 (molecular weight 65kDa band) was observed.
3:::A total of 88 patients met the inclusion criteria for this study. There were 39 patients in the 1-stage revision surgery group (19 male, 20 female) and 49 patients in the 2-stage revision surgery group who underwent tunnel bone grafting first (27 male, 22 female). In both groups, the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) Physical Component Summary, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index, Lysholm, and Tegner activity scale scores significantly improved from preoperatively to postoperatively. There was no significant difference in the SF-12 Mental Component Summary score before and after surgery in either group. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in failure rates or other demographic data between the groups. We observed 4 failures in the 1-stage reconstruction group (10.3%) and 3 failures in the 2-stage reconstruction group (6.1%).
3:::Statistically significant differences in HGS measurements (grip, key pinch, and palmar pinch) between our measurements and normative data were detected in males and females regardless of handedness. When the population was stratified by five year age groups per Mathiowetz Rating Scale and compared to Mathiowetz normal values, 23 out of 120 possible comparisons (19%) had associated p-values <0.10, suggesting moderate evidence of differences between study and reference values. In simulated 10-year age groups, 23 out of 60 possible comparisons (38%) had relatively large differences between our measurements and Mathiowetz [20/23 (87%) were greater than 10% and 8 (35%) were greater that 15%]. Negative differences (N=19) were more frequent than positive differences (N=4), which indicates our patient population as a whole has decreased HGS compared to previous populations though we note this difference in HGS measurements is less in patients over 45 years of age.
3:::The study sample consisted of 51 infants with spinal anesthesia at the University of Vermont and 52 infants with general anesthesia at Columbia University. The decrease from baseline for mean intraoperative SBP was -8.2 ± 16.8% for spinal anesthesia and -24.2 ± 17.2% for general anesthesia (difference between means: 16.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 9.5-22.9]), while the decrease from baseline for mean intraoperative MAP was -16.3 ± 19.9% for spinal anesthesia and -24.6 ± 19.3% for general anesthesia (difference between means: 8.4% [95% CI, 0.8-16]). Spinal anesthesia patients also had smaller drops in minimum intraoperative MAP and SBP. These blood pressure differences persisted even after adjusting for covariates. No differences in heart rate were seen between spinal and general anesthesia.
3:::The literature search identified 3358 original records, of which 10 articles could be included in this review. Four of these studies had a comparative design which made it possible to report the results of, in total, 17 patient series. WBC (or AGA) scintigraphy and FDG-PET exhibit good accuracy for diagnosing PTO (sensitivity ranged from 50-100%, specificity ranged from 40-97% versus 83-100% and 51%-100%, respectively). The accuracy of both modalities improved when a hybrid imaging technique (SPECT/CT & FDG-PET/CT) was performed. For FDG-PET/CT, sensitivity ranged between 86 and 94% and specificity between 76 and 100%. For WBC scintigraphy + SPECT/CT, this is 100% and 89-97%, respectively.
3:::ASD was only half as common among recovered versus depressed BD outpatients, but was significantly associated with hastened depressive recurrence (Log-Rank p=0.007), mediated by lifetime anxiety disorder and attenuated by lifetime history of psychosis, and had only a non-significant tendency towards association with delayed depressive recovery (Log-Rank p=0.07). In both recovered and depressed BD outpatients, baseline ASD did not have significant association with any baseline BD illness characteristic.
3:::Findings show that parents are more involved during the assessment stage than during the implementation and that classroom teachers are often not involved in the initial stage. Speech pathologists in particular are seen to be to a great extent helpful when implementing assistive technology in the classroom. This study found that family-centred service is not yet fully achieved in schools despite being endorsed in early intervention and disability services for over 20 years. No statistically significant differences were found with respect to school staff and allied health professionals roles, their years of experience working with students with cerebral palsy and the scales in the Measure of Processes of Care for Service Providers.'
3:::Among the 70 cases analyzed, we have identified 16 potential clusters of transmission: 8 for genotype 1a (23 cases involved), 1 for genotype 1b (3 cases) and 7 for genotype 4d (27 cases). Although the initial phylogenetic reconstruction suggested a local transmission cluster of HCV gt4d, our approach based on low genetic differentiation did not corroborate it. Indeed, gt4d strains formed 4 independent groups related to patients from other countries.
3:::Relative to the lean non-NAFLD controls, lean patients with NAFLD were older (3.79±0.72 years, P=1.36×10(-6) ) and exhibited the entire spectrum of the MetS risk factors. Specifically, they had a significant (P=10(-10) ) increase in plasma glucose levels (6.44±1.12 mg/dL) and HOMA-IR (0.52±0.094-unit increment), blood lipids (triglycerides: 48.37±3.6, P=10(-10) and total cholesterol: 7.04±3.8, mg/dL, P=4.2×10(-7) ), systolic (5.64±0.7) and diastolic (3.37±0.9) blood pressure (mm Hg), P=10(-10) , and waist circumference (5.88±0.4 cm, P=10(-10) ); values denote difference in means±SE. Nevertheless, the overall alterations in the obese group were much more severe when compared to lean subjects, regardless of the presence of NAFLD. Meta-regression suggested that NAFLD is a modifier of the level of blood lipids.
3:::The apoptosis of the IL-1β-induced SW1353 cells treated with ASG-IV was greatly inhibited. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that gamma actin 1 (ACTG1) and Yes Associated Protein 1 (YAP1), participating in the Hippo signaling pathway and Vitronectin (VTN) and Collagen Type I Alpha 1 Chain (COL1A1), involving in the extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction signaling pathway, were all significantly up-regulated in the IL-1β-induced SW1353 cells after treatment with ASG-IV. The qRT-PCR and Western blotting results confirmed the up-regulation of these four genes.
3:::A total of 568 winter and 1643 summer athletes were included in this study. Privately educated athletes constituted 30.3% and 32.7% of winter and summer athletes, respectively; while 94.9% of winter and 81.7% of summer athletes were white. The CAIs of the Canadian, American, British and Australian winter Olympic teams were 0.52, 0.42, 0.61 and 0.45, respectively. The CAIs, for the Canadian, American, British and Australian summer Olympic teams were 0.89, 1.13, 0.82 and 0.83, respectively. Summer and winter sports with the greatest and least racial and socio-economic biases were identified.
3:::A total of 335 samples from 92 enrolled participants were assessed (mean 4 time-points per participant). At baseline, end of treatment response (ETR) and sustained virological response (SVR) visits, the sensitivity of the HCVcAg assay with quantifiable HCV RNA threshold was 94% (95% CI: 88%, 98%), 56% (21%, 86%) and 100%, respectively. The specificity was between 98 to 100% for all time-points assessed. HCVcAg accurately detected all six participants with viral recurrence, demonstrating 100% sensitivity and specificity. One participant with detectable (non-quantifiable) HCV RNA and non-reactive HCVcAg at SVR12 subsequently cleared HCV RNA at SVR24.
3:::Of the 2088 abstracts retrieved, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria. Following analysis, we identified three major categories of interventions: Comprehensive care plans (n=3), Complex Care Programs (n=8) and Integrated delivery models (n=3). The overall quality of included studies was moderate, with 21% (n=3) scoring 0.25, 29% (n=4) scoring 0.50, 43% (n=6) scoring 0.75, and 7% (n=1) scoring 1.0.
3:::The compared groups were found to be homogeneous in terms of age and systolic blood pressure; the number of sustained torso injuries was also identical. The UE group comprised a slightly greater percentage of females, however both groups were predominantly male. Patients with upper extremity injuries had a lower proportion of internal organ damage (36% vs. 38.5%) and lower mortality (0.9% vs. 2%). The higher mortality of patients without upper extremity wounds remained significantly different even when adjusted by other epidemiological parameters (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.33-5.08).The number of sustained upper extremity injuries was positively associated with deeper penetration of the torso by the stabbing instrument.
3:::A total of 74 patients with first AAP during the study period were included. Of these, 32% developed RAP during follow-up. Of the patients, 72% received a documented BI during initial hospitalization, with no difference between patients who later did or did not develop RAP (71 vs. 72%; ns). Younger age (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.92-1.00) and higher AUDIT points (P = 0.044; OR = 5.6; 95% CI = 1.02-30.9 for ≥20 AUDIT points) were associated with RAP. AUDIT test had 70% sensitivity and 71% specificity at a cut-off value of 20 points for predicting RAP.
3:::The natural logarithm of the average PM10 concentration lagged from 1 to 3 days before relapse onset was significantly associated with relapse risk (OR =1.40 [95% confidence interval 1.08-1.81]) in cold season. Consistent results were observed when considering PM10 as a binary variable, even if not significant.
3:::Among patients aged 15 to 64 years, insurance status was associated with OS (P < .001): being uninsured or having Medicaid was associated with worse 5-year OS in comparison with being insured (uninsured patients, 72.7%; Medicaid patients, 73.1%; insured patients, 86.6%). For patients who were 65 years old or older, insurance had less of an impact on OS (P = .07), with similar 5-year OS rates for patients with Medicaid and those with other insurance (40.2% vs 43.4%). In a multivariate analysis of patients aged 15 to 64 years, both uninsured patients (hazard ratio [HR], 1.93; P < .001) and Medicaid patients (HR, 1.83; P < .001) had an increased hazard of death in comparison with insured patients; patients younger than 40 years, female patients, and married patients also had a lower hazard of death.
3:::Tilting the patients from the horizontal position to the 20-degree head-down position led to a large reduction in oVEMP amplitudes to the 500 Hz tone burst (3.02 μV vs 1.17 μV, p = 0.005) and to a smaller one in the 1000 Hz tone burst (2.28 μV vs 1.78 μV, p = 0.013) in the Ménières ear. Accordingly, the 500/1000 Hz frequency-tuning ratio was significantly decreased in the Ménière's ear as a result of this manoeuver (1.36 vs 0.75, p = 0.005).'
3:::Amplitude adaptation was altered by cTBS, suggesting that cTBS interferes with cerebellar plasticity involved in saccade adaptation. Amplitude adaptation and spontaneous recovery were not affected by cTBS when recordings were preceded by memantine administration.
3:::We observed differences in allele distribution patterns between agriculturalists and hunter-gatherers for some markers. For instance, between-groups component of genetic variance (FCT ) for APOE rs429358 showed strong differences in allelic distributions between hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists (p = 0.00196). Gene-gene interaction analysis indicated that the APOE E4/CD36 TT and APOE E4/IGF2BP2 A carrier combinations occur at a higher frequency in hunter-gatherers, but this combination is not replicated in archaic (Neanderthal and Denisovan) and ancient (Anzick, Saqqaq, Ust-Ishim, Malta) hunter-gatherer individuals.'
3:::There were no significant between-group differences in the stage of HIV infection at the start of cART or the type of regimen received. The Latin American DMs and UMs included a higher proportion of transgender women than the other ethnic groups (P < 0.001). The UMs were less frequently followed up after 12 months than the DMs and natives (P = 0.004) and were more frequently permanently lost to follow-up (P < 0.001). UM status was an independent predictor of lost to follow-up (adjusted odds ratio 8.05, P < 0.001). The DMs and UMs were less frequently HIV suppressed after 12 months than the natives (78% and 80.7% vs 90.5%, P = 0.001), and Latin American migrants were significantly less likely to be virologically suppressed than the natives (adjusted odds ratio 0.30, P = 0.001).
3:::nTMS motor mapping is a reliable and clinically validated tool to identify functional areas belonging to both normal and lesioned primary motor cortex. In contrast, this is less clear for language-eloquent cortical areas identified by nTMS. The user group agreed on a core protocol, which enables comparison of results between centers and has an excellent safety profile. Recommendations for nTMS motor and language mapping protocols and their optimal clinical integration are presented here.
3:::Results from an Analysis of Variance corrected for whole brain multiple comparisons showed a significant group x condition interaction in the left amygdala and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Results from post-hoc analyses showed that the GAD group engaged these regions to a greater extent than HCs during Look-Negative but not Reappraise. Behaviorally, the GAD group reported feeling more negative than the HC group in each condition, although both groups reported reduced negative affect following regulation.
3:::A total of 126 adult patients (76 dental emergency patients and 50 implant consultation patients) participated in the study. The general population group was less informed about dental implants, especially information relating to implant material and longevity, and received information from less reliable sources than patients presenting for implant screening (friends or relatives vs primary dentist). Both groups reported cost of the procedure as a primary barrier to receiving implants (89% and 90%).
3:::Fifteen head and neck paragangliomas were identified. None of the patients developed a new lower cranial nerve palsy or progression of their presenting hearing loss during the follow-up period. Five patients displayed an increase in maximum linear dimension of 4 mm over an average of 57.4 months. A review of the literature showed that a watch-and-surveillance scan policy is evolving as a treatment option for head and neck paragangliomas without malignant risk factors.
3:::A total of 7630 infants from 32 studies in 17 countries were included. Mean (SD) age at baseline was 9.0 (2.3) weeks; 3906 (51.2%) were boys. Preexisting maternal antibody inhibited infant antibody responses to priming doses for 20 of 21 antigens. The largest effects were observed for inactivated polio vaccine, where 2-fold higher maternal antibody concentrations resulted in 20% to 28% lower postvaccination antibody concentration (geometric mean ratios [GMRs], type 1: 0.80; 95% CI, 0.78-0.83; type 2: 0.72; 95% CI, 0.69-0.74; type 3: 0.78; 95% CI, 0.75-0.82). For acellular pertussis antigens, 2-fold higher maternal antibody was associated with 11% lower postvaccination antibody for pertussis toxoid (GMR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.87-0.90) and filamentous hemagglutinin (GMR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.88-0.90) and 22% lower pertactin antibody (GMR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.77-0.80). For tetanus and diphtheria, these estimates were 13% (GMR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.86-0.88) and 24% (GMR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.74-0.77), respectively. The influence of maternal antibody was still evident in reduced responses to booster doses of acellular pertussis, inactivated polio, and diphtheria vaccines at 12 to 24 months of age. Children who were older when first immunized had higher antibody responses to priming doses for 18 of 21 antigens, after adjusting for the effect of maternal antibody concentrations. The largest effect was seen for polyribosylribitol phosphate antibody, where responses were 71% higher per month (GMR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.52-1.92).
3:::The median (interquartile range) of operative time of the operation was 4.7 (3.9-5.4) hours. The median (interquartile range) of operative time of the cutaneous pouch creation was 39 (33-43) minutes. No perioperative mortality had occurred. The incidence of continence was 95.2%. The overall complications were 42.8%, and most of them were grade 1 or 2 on Clavien-Dindo classification system.
3:::Data for 4,110 participants were included: 67.2% were women; median age was 37 (IQR: 31-43) years. Median baseline CD4 count was 197 (IQR: 95-337) cells/mm(3) . The proportion of participants with hypertension at baseline was 15.5% (n=638). Over a median follow-up time of 4.7 (IQR: 2.1-7.2) years, 57 patients developed T2DM; the overall incidence rate was 2.8 (95% CI: 2.1-3.6) per 1000 person-years of follow-up. Exposure to PIs was associated with T2DM (HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.04-3.09). In the multivariable analysis, obesity (BMI>30 kg/m(2) ) (aHR=2.26, 95% CI: 1.17-4.36), age >40 years (aHR=2.16, 95% CI: 1.22-3.83) and male gender, (aHR=2.13, 95% CI: 1.22-3.72) were independently associated with the risk of T2DM. HIV-related factors (baseline CD4 cell count and baseline WHO clinical stage) were not independent risk factors for developing T2DM.
3:::27,637 patients (58.0% women) had hypertension and diabetes and met selection criteria. Mean age was 75.9 years (standard deviation [SD]: 6.7). Both diseases were well controlled simultaneously in 34.2% of patients. The combination of biguanides and diuretics achieved the highest association with good control. Adherence to pharmacological treatment was more difficult in diabetes than in hypertension. Lack of control was associated significantly with non-adherence to treatment, 0-12 PHC visits, obesity and increasing number of diabetes prescriptions.
3:::Mean (SD) PIIINP was 5.47 (1.95) μg/L and ICTP was 3.37 (1.70) μg/L. PIIINP and ICTP were highly correlated with each other and with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Adjustment for age and eGFR attenuated relative risks, remaining 20%-30% per SD of both PIIINP and ICTP in prediction for total death and ChrIRD, and of PIIINP for cancer, with little additional attenuation by adjusting for risk factors and inflammatory biomarkers. CVD outcome was generally unrelated to PIIINP but became marginally inversely related to ICTP in the most adjusted model.
3:::Of 50 patients, 33 (66%) had conducted a search for the surgery on the Internet. All university graduates, 88.2% of high school graduates, and 18.7% of primary-secondary school graduates had conducted an Internet search. The quality and reliability of the information was high (4.5 points) for 2 (7.1%) websites, moderate (2.3 points) for 6 websites (21.4%) and poor (1 point) for 20 websites (71.4%) as scored with the DISCERN(®) instrument. The mean DISCERN(®) score of was 1.1 for websites of health-related institutions or healthcare news, 2.75 for personal websites of physicians and 2.5 for personal websites of non-physicians. The mean DISCERN(®) score of all websites was 1.5.
3:::In the overall study cohort, 5-year OS (75.2% versus 58.5%, p = 0.004) and DFS (71.8% versus 49.2%, p = 0.001) rates were significantly higher in the S+cRT group than in the S group. These data were confirmed in the matched samples (5-year OS, 75.7% versus 58.8% [p = 0.017]; DFS, 71.7% versus 50.3% [p = 0.009]). The overall (p = 0.001) and locoregional (p = 0.004) recurrence rates in the S+cRT group were significantly lower than in the S group. Multivariate Cox analyses in the matched samples revealed that surgery and postoperative cRT were independently associated with longer OS (hazard ratio = 0.505, 95% confidence interval: 0.291-0.876, p = 0.015) and longer DFS (hazard ratio = 0.513, 95% confidence interval: 0.309-0.854, p = 0.010) than resection alone.
3:::ROC analysis showed lower area under the curve (AUC) values for fixed threshold cutoffs (650 or 850 HU) compared to thresholds relative to LA. The LA+100 threshold had the highest AUC (0.81), and AUC was higher than all studied protocols, other than the LA x 1.25 and LA + 50 protocols, where the difference approached statistical significance (p = 0.05, and 0.068, respectively). Multivariable analysis showed calcium volume determined by the LAx1.25, LAx1.5, LA+50, and LA+ 100 HU protocols to independently predict PVR.
3:::Reported marijuana use doubled between 2009 and 2013 among Chilean adolescents. After controlling for secular trends in outcomes and for school characteristics, there was no evidence of increased marijuana initiation, alcohol and marijuana use, or of an increase in heavy use among adolescents being directly attributable to school strikes and occupations in 2011.
3:::The prevalence of social frailty was the following: nonfrailty, 64.1% (N = 2835); social prefrailty, 24.8% (N = 1097); social frailty, 11.1% (N = 493; P for trend < .001). All cognitive function tests (word list memory, Trail Making Test parts A and B, and the symbol digit-substitution task) significantly varied between social frailty groups; physical function (gait speed and grip strength) also varied between social frailty groups (all Ps for trend <.001). Referred to social nonfrailty, social frailty was independently associated with each cognitive deficit (odds ratio = 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.13-2.30) and deficits in physical function (odds ratio = 1.99, 95% confidence interval 1.57-2.52) after adjusting for covariates.
3:::Isthmic spondylolisthesis occurred from L3 to S1 and mostly occurred at two consecutive spinal levels (i.e., L4-L5 and L5-S1). Significant improvements in the ODI and visual analog scale were observed in patients at final follow up (p<0.05). The mean segmental lordosis significantly increased after operation (from 22.7° to 32.7°). The mean lumbar lordosis significantly increased after operation (from 45.8 to 53.1). Radiographs of all of the patients showed solid fusion at the last follow-up. There was one case of screw fracture at the S1 level; however, in this case the last follow-up radiograph exhibited solid fusion.
3:::One hundred and eleven women were included in the study with 55 in the pipelle group and 56 in the control arm. The baseline clinical characteristics were similar in both groups. The clinical pregnancy rates were not significantly different between pipelle and control group (34.09% vs. 27.65%; Odds ratio, OR 1.35, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.55-3.30). The live birth (31.81% vs. 25.53%; OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.55-3.39), multiple pregnancy (33.33% vs. 61.54%; OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.07-1.47), miscarriage (6.66% vs. 7.69%; OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.05-15.23) and preterm delivery rates (35.71% vs. 66.66%; OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.05-1.4) were also not significantly different between the two groups.
3:::The STS was present in 79% of controls, statistically greater than the PD/Parkinson-Plus patients. There was no difference in the presence of the STS between the PD/Parkinson-Plus subgroups or when scanning at 1.5 T or 3 T.
3:::Seventy two representative measurements were obtained. Mean differences (bias) between invasive and non-invasive measurements were <5 mmHg except for DAP measured on the tail, and SD (precision) were <15 mm Hg except for SAP measured at the pelvic limb. Correlation coefficients were >0.9 except for SAP on the pelvic limb and DAP on the tail. More than 50 and 80% of values measured using oscillometry lay within 10 and 20 mmHg, respectively, of values measured invasively except for SAP on the tail. SAP tended to be overestimated when measured non-invasively at low BP, and be underestimated at high BP. DAP was underestimated during low BP and overestimated during high BP. Hypotension (MAP <60 mmHg) was detected by the oscillometer with a sensitivity ≥83% and specificity ≥98% at all locations.
3:::The median difference between the nicotine value on the labels and the nicotine content in the bottles was 0.3mg/mL (range -5.4 to +3.5mg/mL, i.e. -8% to +30%). For 82% of the samples, the actual nicotine content was within 10% of the value on the labels. All models contained glycerol (median 407mg/mL), and all but three models contained propylene glycol (median 650mg/mL). For all samples, levels of anabasine, ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol were below our limits of detection. The pH of all the e-liquids was alkaline (median pH=9.1; range 8.1 to 9.9). The measured content of two batches of the same model varied by a median of 0% across batches for propylene glycol, 1% for glycerol, 0% for pH, and 0.5% for nicotine (range -15% to +21%; 5th and 95th percentiles: -15% and +10%).
3:::Repeatability experiments in five participants revealed large variability within each subjects evaluated characteristics, with almost all experiencing variation greater than 50% of full scale when repeating the same task.
3:::Although our DTNT did not significantly improve over the years, the median DTNT (59 minutes) was much less than the reported 75 minutes of GWTGS hospitals. Our DTCT time diminished from 20.6 minutes in 2009 to 15.9 minutes in 2014. The percentage of patients with a DTNT of 1 hour or less did not differ among all years (P = .296) and was 55.8%.
3:::In the sated session, negative mood induction produced a greater increase in tobacco choice from baseline to test in depressed (p<0.001, ηp(2)=0.782) compared to non-depressed smokers (p=0.045, ηp(2)=0.216, interaction: p=0.046, ηp(2)=0.150). Abstinence also produced a greater increase in baseline tobacco choice between the sated and abstinent sessions in depressed (p=0.002, ηp(2)=0.771) compared to non-depressed smokers (p=0.22, ηp(2)=0.089, interaction: p=0.023, ηp(2)=0.189). These mood and abstinence induced increases in tobacco choice were positively associated with depression symptoms across the sample as a whole (ps≤0.04, ηp(2)≥0.159), and correlated with each other (r=0.67, p<0.001).
3:::Significant increases in N120 amplitudes (p<0.01) were observed following iTBS over prefrontal cortex. Changes in TMS-evoked theta oscillations and LICI of theta oscillations were also observed following iTBS (increase) and cTBS (decrease). Change in LICI of theta oscillations correlated with change in N120 amplitude following TBS (r=-0.670, p=0.001).
3:::Compared to SAMR1 control, SAMP8 mice demonstrate impaired glucose tolerance and reduction in circulating adiponectin level; in the liver, SAMP8 mice have reduction in p-Aktser473, elevation in PTP1B and APP, p-eIF2α, GRP78 and p-JNK protein expression. In epididymal (EPI) fat, SAMP8 mice also have elevated p-Aktser473 and PTP1B compared to SAMR1 mice. In both epididymal (EPI) and subcutaneous (SC) fat, there were elevated ER stress markers, reduced p-AMPK and elevated APP, as well as elevated p-NF-κBp65 and TNF-α protein expression from SAMP8 compared to SAMR1 mice. In liver, the combined intervention significantly restored p-Aktser473, p-eIF2α and p-JNK protein expression. In both EPI and SC fat, the combined intervention is effective for reducing p-NF-κB p65 and TNF-α in both fat depot, while only partially reduced ER stress markers in SC fat. As for adiponectin, their combination is unable to reverse reduction in adiponectin level. Adiponectin secretion in SC fat from VD, RSV and VDRSV group were also significantly reduced compared to SAMR1.
3:::There was significant disagreement between both the two P1NP assays with a mean difference of -3 μg/L (LoA -19 to 14) (p < 0.001) and the two CTX assays with a mean difference of 13 ng/L (LoA-187 to 214) (p < 0.001). For CTX, there was a systematic bias: at low values, Cobas measured a higher value than iSYS and at higher concentrations, iSYS measured increasingly higher values than Cobas. Based on the results, we propose three reference intervals for each sex: 25-29, 30-39, and 40-80 years for men, and 25-29, >30 (pre-menopausal), and >30 years (post-menopausal) for women.
3:::There were 91 older-onset, 389 younger-onset, and 3431 young patients with Crohns disease. Older-onset patients had more ileal (37%) and colonic (27%) disease compared with younger-onset and young patients. There were no differences in disease behavior, location, or surgeries between older-onset and young patients with Crohn's disease within 5 years of diagnosis. Older-onset patients with inflammatory disease had a higher odds of being in remission. Young patients reported more anti-tumor necrosis factor and thiopurine use compared with younger-onset and older-onset patients (P < 0.01). There were 98 older-onset, 218 younger-onset, and 1702 young patients with ulcerative colitis. There were no differences in disease extent, activity index, or surgeries. Young patients with ulcerative colitis reported more anti-tumor necrosis factor use (26%) compared with younger-onset patients (17%, P < 0.01).'
3:::The time to react to target illumination reduced with learning of the movement sequence, irrespective of tDCS condition (p>0.1). JTT performance improved after unilateral tDCS (anodal or cathodal) compared with sham (p<0.05), but not after bihemispheric (p>0.1). There was no effect of tDCS on change in iSP duration (p>0.1).
3:::The 2012 national estimate of U.S. ED visits (children <10years) with definitive maltreatment is 14,457 (95% CI: 11,987-16,928). Suggestive child maltreatment was seen in an additional 103,392 (95% CI: 90,803-115,981) pediatric ED visits. After controlling for patient case mix, high volume hospitals had a significantly higher adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of admission/transfer among definitive cases (AOR=1.74, 95% CI: 1.08-2.81), and medium volume hospitals had a higher odds of admission/transfer among suggestive cases (AOR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.02-1.50) when compared with low volume hospitals. In hospitals with reliable reporting of imaging procedures, high volume hospitals reported skeletal surveys (age <2 years) significantly more often than low volume hospitals, AOR=3.32 (95% CI: 1.25-8.84); the AORs for head CT did not differ by hospital volume.
3:::SIP epochs selected at lower contraction levels have a stronger influence on the repeatability of MUNIX than those selected at higher contraction levels. MUNIX under repeatability conditions follows a normal distribution and the standard deviation can be significantly reduced by introducing more epochs near the MUNIX definition line.
3:::Of the 14,795 individuals in the analytic sample, there were 81.9% in the sole source category, 6.6% in the VHA+cash payment(s) category, and 11.5% in the VHA+noncash source(s) category. In logistic regression, controlling for age and sex, persons with multiple payment sources had significantly higher odds of each risky opioid therapy, with those in the VHA+cash having significantly higher odds than those in the VHA+noncash source(s) group.
3:::We identified 35, 793, 231, 668 and 252 differentially expressed (DE) genes for Blo, Amy, Cer, ACC and PFC regions. A region-dependent significant enrichment for several functional categories, such as gene ontologies, signaling pathways and topographic parameters, was identified. There was convergence with other available genome-wide studies, such as GWAS, DNA methylation analyses and miRNA expression studies.
3:::Vertebral compression fractures were present in 78% (7/9) of those aged over 50years but were not seen in younger mutation-positive subjects. All those with fractures had several severely compressed vertebrae. Altogether spinal compression fractures were present in 39% of those with a WNT1 mutation. Only 14% (2/14) mutation-negative subjects had one mild compressed vertebra each. The mutation-positive subjects had a higher mean spinal deformity index (4.0±7.3 vs 0.0±0.4) and more often increased thoracic kyphosis (Z-score>+2.0 in 33% vs 0%). Further, they had more often Schmorl nodes (61% vs 36%), already in adolescence, and their intervertebral discs were enlarged.
3:::Patients with low appendicular lean mass plus slowness or weakness showed a significantly lower recovery of MHQ score than those in the control group throughout 12 months. There was no significant difference in the range of motion between the groups. The radiologic outcomes showed no significant difference between groups in terms of volar tilt, radial inclination, or ulnar variance. According to multivariable regression analysis, the poor recovery of MHQ score was associated with an increase in age, weak grip strength, and lower appendicular lean mass, and these three factors accounted for 37% of the variation in the MHQ scores.
3:::Nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter concentrations were associated with type 2 diabetes in unadjusted models. There was no statistically significant association between nitrogen dioxide concentration and type 2 diabetes after adjustment for demographic factors (odds: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.29). The odds of type 2 diabetes was 1.10 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.32) after further adjustment for lifestyle factors and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.16) after yet further adjustment for neighbourhood green space. The associations between particulate matter concentrations and type 2 diabetes were also explained away by demographic factors. There was no evidence of exposure definition bias.
3:::One hundred and eighty-three patients were included (87 ulcerative colitis (UC); 93 Crohns disease (CD); three IBD-unclassified). The median (IQR) annual overall cost was higher in the CD versus UC group ($15,648 versus $5017; p < .001). The difference in cost between CD and UC was influenced by the difference in outpatient costs for CD patients $9602 ($4311-$29,805) versus $4867 ($3220-$7249), p < .001). The cost of treating patients with active disease was $3461 ($1607-$11,771) and was higher in the CD versus the UC group ($6098 ($2168-$16,471) versus $1638 ($1401-$3767); p = .026) and was influenced by inpatient admissions. The cost of treating patients in remission was $2090 ($1552-$12,954) and was higher in the CD versus the UC group [$7977 ($1579-$14,304) versus $1848 ($1508-$6601); p = .236].'
3:::The hip abduction and extension moments decreased as the hip moved from an adducted position and flexed position to an abducted position and extended position, respectively, resulting in a descending joint moment angle curve for each.
3:::Bleeding was gastrointestinal or intracranial in 37% (212 of 732) and 24% (141 of 732) of the cases, respectively. Creatinine clearance was lower than 60 ml/min in 61% (449 of 732) of the cases. The plasma concentration of direct oral anticoagulants was determined in 62% (452 of 732) of the cases and was lower than 50 ng/ml or higher than 400 ng/ml in 9.2% (41 of 452) and in 6.6% (30 of 452) of the cases, respectively. Activated or nonactivated prothrombin complex concentrates were administered in 38% of the cases (281 of 732). Mortality by day 30 was 14% (95% CI, 11 to 16).
3:::Mean age of the cohort was 72.8±11.2years, 1187 (50.5%) were women, and 1252 (53.4%) and 410 (17.5%) showed HFpEF and HFmrEF, respectively. At a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 2.3 (0.8-4.5) years, we registered 1114 (47.6%) deaths, and 1834 HF-related rehospitalizations in 943 (40.2%) patients. After multivariable adjustment, and compared to patients with normal PASP, severe PH exhibited an independent higher risk of recurrent HF admissions only in HFpEF (IRR=1.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.16-2.38; p=0.005), whereas in HFmrEF patients there was a non-significant trend to higher HF readmissions (IRR: 1.73; 95% CI, 0.85-3.55; p=0.132). Severe PH was not related with recurrent hospitalizations in HFrEF (IRR: 1.19; 95% CI, 0.66-2.14; p=0.553).
3:::AMI was the final diagnosis in 16.5% (95% CI, 14.6%-18.6%) of the 1372 patients in APACE, and 12.6% (95% CI, 10.7%-14.7%) of 1153 patients in ADAPT. The negative predictive value (NPV) and sensitivity for AMI were very high and comparable with both strategies using either hs-cTnT or hs-cTnI in both cohorts (all statistical comparisons nonsignificant). The percentage of patients triaged toward rule-out was significantly lower with the 2h-ADP (36%-43%) vs the 2-h algorithm (55%-68%) with both assays and in both cohorts (P < 0.001). The sensitivity of the 2h-ADP was higher for 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events.
3:::At baseline, the frequency of DSM-IV mixed episodes diagnoses obtained with the MINI was 17% and with the BISS was 20%. Using DSM-5 criteria, 9% of participants met criteria for hypomania/mania with mixed features and 12% met criteria for a depressive episode with mixed features. Symptom severity was also associated with increased mixed features with a high rate of mixed features in patients with mania/hypomania (63.8%) relative to those with depression (8.0%).
3:::DES revealed a novel nonsense mutation c.2596G>T (p.Glu866*) of the NSD1 gene in the proband, the first of monozygotic twins. Sanger sequencing analysis of the proband and his family members showed that this nonsense mutation was present in the proband and his sibling, but was absent in their parents, indicating that it occurred with de novo origin.
3:::Results from multivariate analysis showed that only the HLA-B*58:01 and female sex were identified as risk factors of allopurinol-induced SCARs in this Thai population. Patients who carried the HLA-B*58:01 allele were at a higher risk of allopurinol-induced DRESS [odds ratio (OR)=149.2, 95% confidence interval (CI)=24.0-∞, P<1.00×10]. Similar results were observed in allopurinol-induced SJS/TEN (OR=175.0, 95% CI=44.3-690.9, P=1.69×10). The risk of allopurinol-induced SCARs in women was higher than that in men (OR=4.6, 95% CI=1.4-15.6, P=1.44×10). The overall mortality rate of allopurinol-induced SCARs was 11.39% and a higher mortality rate was observed in elderly women.
3:::Baseline and dilation diameters were expressed as ratios of pharmacologically induced maximum dilation, whereas percent dilation was defined as the change in diameter over baseline diameter. We found a significant increase in resting diameter with BTX pretreatment (P = 0.0028). Compared with the control group, mean baseline diameter was 15% greater, and percent dilation was 25% less in BTX-pretreated flaps. There was no significant relationship between BTX pretreatment and dilation diameter (P = 0.2895) after adjusting for the effect of acute vasodilators.
3:::Patients with PTS were older (64.0 y vs 55.5 y; P = .007) and more frequently experienced recurrent DVT (15% vs 3%; P = .030). Patients with PTS had a lower rate of recanalization. Patients with residual thrombus appeared to be at increased risk for PTS development compared with patients with total recanalization (odds ratio 6.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-21.9; P = .006). No difference in the presence of reflux was observed.
3:::Detection rates of B. pseudomallei using CC, EC and PCR were 3.8%, 5.3% and 6%, respectively. Diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of CC and PCR were 71.4, 98.4% and 100 and 99.4%, respectively in comparison with EC as the gold standard test. With Bayesian latent class modelling, EC and PCR demonstrated sensitivities of 98.7 and 99.3%, respectively, while CC showed a sensitivity of 70.3% for detection of B. pseudomallei. An increase of 1.6% (95% CI: 1.08-4.32%) in the case detection rate of melioidosis was observed in the study population when EC and/or PCR were used in adjunct to the conventional culture technique.
3:::There was no difference in total fat for the BAT cohort (34±15 l) compared with the controls (34±16 l) (P=0.96). The BAT cohort had lower abdominal fat to total fat ratio compared with the controls (0.28±0.05 vs. 0.31±0.08, respectively; P=0.01). The BAT cohort had a lower visceral fat/(visceral fat+subcutaneous fat) ratio compared with the controls (0.30±0.10 vs. 0.34±0.12, respectively; P=0.03). Patients with BAT had higher liver density, suggesting less liver fat, compared with the controls (51.3±7.5 vs. 47.1±7.0 HU, P=0.003).
3:::Two-way ANOVA for repeated measures on absolute values (actual recordings) and on changes from baseline revealed that, compared to controls, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure and heart rate were significantly lower after mandibular extension. Compared to controls, mandibular extension induced an average blood pressure drop of 2.88 mmHg (systolic), 2.55 mmHg (diastolic) and 2.42 mmHg (mean) over the entire observation period. The average decline over the central part of the observation period (30th to 80th min) was, respectively, of 3.62, 3.70 and 3.61 mmHg. The decrements of heart rate were of 2.11 and 2.66 beats per min. All these differences were statistically significant. The hypotensive and bradycardic responses persisted for 70-120 min.
3:::The group comparison between alcohol-dependent individuals and controls clearly confirmed that emotional and interpersonal difficulties constitute a key factor in alcohol-dependence. However, the cluster analysis identified five subgroups of alcohol-dependent individuals, presenting distinct combinations of alexithymia and interpersonal problems ranging from a total absence of reported impairment to generalized socio-emotional difficulties.
3:::Of the six measured cytokines, three were nondetectable at rates greater than 50% (IL-10, IL-1β, TGF-β1) and, because of overall low prevalence, were not analyzed further. For the remaining cytokines (TNFα, IL-6, sTNFR1), results showed that TNFα and IL-6 increased during the follow-up period (between 6 and 12 weeks) rather than during the MBSR(BC) training period (between baseline and 6 weeks), while sTNFR1 levels did not change significantly across the 12-week period.
3:::HRV during REM sleep was decreased in depressed patients at week four as compared to controls (high effect size; Cohens d > 1), and showed a negative correlation with REM density in both, healthy subjects and patients at week four. Further, the fourteen responders had significantly higher prefrontal theta cordance as compared to the nineteen non-responders after the first week of antidepressant medication; in contrast, HRV at week one did not discriminate between responders and non-responders.'
3:::LOLA produced signals of the expected sizes for the cell lines. Normal control DNA yielded no signals. A dilution series yielded translocation-specific peaks at dilutions as low as 1%. Signal intensity was log linear to the DNA concentration (R(2) = 0.94). Furthermore, we were able to detect a LOLA peak in DNA from 53.3% of FL patients and 87.5% of CML patients. The concordance between LOLA, FISH, and δ-PCR in FL was also excellent.
3:::Maternal hypothyroxinaemia <5th percentile was associated with a 1.70 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-2.86) increased odds of teacher-reported hyperactivity/inattention after adjustment for confounders. By increasing the cut-off level to <10th percentile, the odds ratio became 1.47 (95% CI: 0.99-2.20). There were no associations between maternal thyroid function parameters and hyperactivity/inattention as reported by parents, nor with teacher or parent reports of other types of problem behavior.
3:::A total of 992 patients have been discharged with codes consistent with primary aldosteronism during 16 years in Emilia-Romagna, that is 1.9% of the expected cases of primary aldosteronism. A total of 160 of them underwent adrenalectomy in the same period, which corresponds to 1% of the expected cases of unilateral primary aldosteronism in Emilia-Romagna.
3:::A total of 72 participants were included (16 PSP, 18 PNFA, 16 LPA and 22 controls). Patients with PSP had motor features typical of the syndrome. Both the M/P ratio and Magnetic Resonance Parkinsonism Index differed significantly in PSP compared with controls. The M/P ratio was disproportionately reduced in PSP compared with PNFA and LPA (PSP, 0.182 ± 0.043; PNFA, 0.255 ± 0.034; LPA, 0.258 ± 0.033; controls, 0.292 ± 0.031; P < 0.001). An M/P ratio of ≤0.215 produced a positive predictive value of 77.8% for the diagnosis of PSP syndrome. Pathological examination revealed Alzheimers disease in three cases (all LPA), pathological PSP in two cases (one clinical PSP and one PNFA) and corticobasal degeneration in one case (PNFA). The M/P ratio was ≤0.215 in both pathological cases of PSP.'
3:::The absolute decrease in 1-year diabetes incidence rates in subjects treated with medication versus placebo was greatest in those with high-risk CMDS scores at baseline (10.43-6.29%), intermediate in those with moderate CMDS risk (4.67-2.37%), and small in the low-risk category (1.51-0.67%). The number of participants needed to treat to prevent one new case of diabetes over a 56-week period was 24, 43, and 120 in those with baseline CMDS scores of ≥60, 30-59, and 0-29, respectively.
3:::The recommended dose of capecitabine was determined to be 2000 mg/m(2). Median progression-free survival was 7.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.1-10.9 months], and median overall survival was 18.9 months (95% CI 11.6-28.4 months). Response rate was 17.4% (95% CI 6.4-28.3%). The most common Grade ≥3 hematotoxic adverse events were anemia (10.9%), neutropenia (10.9%), and leukopenia (8.7%), while the occurrence rate of Grade ≥3 non-hematotoxic adverse events was relatively low (<10%).
3:::One thousand one hundred eighty-eight (7.4%) respondents completed the e-survey. The top three items overall were Having easy access to advice and information from health professionals' (63.8%), 'Understanding further the safety and benefit of osteoporosis drug treatments' (49.9%) and 'Identifying the condition early by screening' (49.2%). Latent class analysis revealed distinct clusters of responses within each topic including primary care management and self-management. Those without a history of prior fracture or aged under 70 were more likely to rate items within the cluster of self-management as important (21.0 vs 12.9 and 19.8 vs 13.3%, respectively).'
3:::A total of 923 patients from 2004 to 2012 were analyzed. Of these, 43% underwent clinical Obs, 22% underwent CRT, 25% underwent LE, and 10% underwent Eso. Patients undergoing Obs were older, had more comorbidities, were treated at nonacademic centers, and lived 25 miles or less from the facility. Patients receiving an operation (Eso or LE) were more often younger, male, white, and in the top income quartile. The postoperative 30-day mortality rates in the LE and Eso groups were 1.3% and 9.6%, respectively (p < 0.001) and increased to 2.6% and 20.2% at 90 days, respectively (p < 0.001). The 5-year OS rate was 7% for Obs, 20% for CRT, 33% for LE, and 45% for Eso (p < 0.001). Multivariate analyses showed improved OS with any local definitive therapy: CRT (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34-0.52, p < 0.001), LE (HR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.24-0.38, p < 0.001), and Eso (HR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.23-0.44, p < 0.001).
3:::Neither acute grade 3 or higher GU nor rectal toxicity was observed. Regardless of the fact that 29 (13.3%) patients experienced intermediate-term toxicity requiring diagnostic interventions, the rates of intermediate-term grade 3 GU, rectal and infectious toxicity were low, 1.8%, 0.9% and 1.4%, respectively. A biochemical relapse was observed in ten (4.6%) patients. With the median follow-up time of 23 months the biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) rate was 100%, 96.6% and 92.8% in low-, intermediate- and high-risk group, respectively.
3:::The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia was 6.6%, it was found to be higher in urban areas (8.4%) than in rural areas (4.6%). The prevalence of low HDL cholesterol levels was higher in urban (28.8%) than rural (23.9%) areas. The prevalence of family history of cardiovascular disease did not differ between the two sexes and between urban (15.7%) and rural (14.0%) areas. The prevalence of hypertension was higher in urban (28.0%) than in rural (16.8%) areas, and was highest among women aged 65 years or older in urban areas (67.3%) and in rural areas (66.6%). The prevalence of diabetes was higher among women living in urban areas (21.4%) compared with rural areas (15.4%). Obesity was much more frequent among women than among men in urban areas (24.7% in women and 9.5% in men) and in rural areas (28.3% in women and 8.3% in men). The prevalence of smoking was 45.8% for men and with no significant variations between urban areas and rural areas.
3:::From 1996 to 2013, the total number of cycles in women ≥40 years increased from 8672 to 28,883 (p < 0.0001), with frozen cycles almost tripling in the last 8 years. Cycles in women ≥40 years accounted for 16.0% of all cycles in 1996 and 21.0% in 2013 (p < 0.0001). For fresh cycles from 2007 to 2013 (n = 157,890), the cancelation rate was 17.1%. Among cycles resulting in transfer (n = 112,414), the live birth rate was 16.1%. The following were associated with higher live birth rates: multiparity, fewer prior ART cycles, use of standard agonist or antagonist stimulation, lower gonadotropin dose, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, more oocytes retrieved, use of pre-implantation genetic screening/diagnosis, transferring more and/or blastocyst stage embryos, and cryopreserving more supernumerary embryos. Of the singleton infants born (n = 14,992), 86.9% were full term and 88.3% normal birth weight.
3:::There were no differences between AgP and H groups with regard to MCP-1 and CCR2 genotype distribution and allele frequencies (p>0.05). In contrast, the MCP-1 mRNA expression levels were higher in homozygous ""AA"" control subjects than having G(+) genotype and AA homozygous AgP patients.
3:::Their tailored fit greatly facilitated surgical implantation, and eliminated the gap between the implant and the bone. To date, our implants remain robust and well-integrated with the skull.
3:::Sixty-seven patients were identified. Median age was 74 years (interquartile range [IQR], 63.5-78) and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 17 (IQR, 12-21). Median transfer time measured by PSC-door-to-comprehensive stroke center-door was 128 minutes (IQR, 107-164), of which 82.8% was spent at PSCs (door-in-door-out [DIDO]; 106 minutes; IQR, 86-143). The lengthiest component of DIDO was computed-tomography-to-retrieval-request (median 59.5 minutes; IQR, 44-83). The 37.3% had DIDO exceeding 120 minutes. DIDO times differed significantly between PSCs (P=0.01). In multivariate analyses, rerecruiting the initial ambulance crew for transfer (P<0.01) and presentation during working hours (P=0.04) were associated with shorter DIDO times.
3:::Forty-eight case patients and 154 control patients were included. Patients with preoperative CDI were younger (P = 0.010), had higher rates of medically refractory disease (P = 0.002), and had greater use of biologic therapy (P = 0.046). The rate of pouchitis was 50.0% (n = 24) and 46.8% (n = 72) (P = 0.694) among patients with and without preoperative CDI, respectively. Patients with preoperative CDI who developed pouchitis post-IPAA were more likely to require medical management with an anti-TNFα (P = 0.042) and surgical management with end/diverting ileostomy (P = 0.042). Preoperative CDI was associated with higher rates of postoperative IPAA anastamotic or pouch strictures (P = 0.018). Multivariable analysis revealed primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) as the only variable associated with increased risk for pouchitis (OR 10.59; 95% CI, 3.07-51.08; P < 0.001).
3:::Compared with the bottom tertile, the highest tertile of maternal urinary As during pregnancy was associated with a 145.2ng/ml (95% CI 4.1, 286.3; p=0.04) increase in cord blood ICAM1 and 557.3ng/ml (95% CI -56.4, 1171.1; p=0.09) increase in cord blood VCAM1. Among mothers, the highest tertile of maternal urinary As during pregnancy was related to a 141.8ng/ml (95% CI 26.1, 257.5; p=0.02) increase maternal plasma VCAM1 levels. Urinary As was unrelated to MCP1 or TNFα in maternal plasma and cord blood. In structural equation models, the association between maternal urinary As and infant VCAM was mediated by maternal levels of VCAM (βmediation: 0.024, 95% CI: 0.002, 0.050).
3:::It was observed that there is a loss of organization of crystallites in deciduous incisal enamel affected by Hunter syndrome (MPS II) as compared to healthy deciduous enamel tissue. Generally it was observed that, in contrast to the healthy enamel, the enamel affected by MPS II possessed a lower crystallographic preferred orientation, with a more uniform spatial distribution; however, the enamel at the incisal tip was relatively unaffected.
3:::With the established IVIVC model, there was a good correlation between the observed fraction of dose excreted in urine and the time-scaled and time-shifted fraction of the drug dissolved, and between the in vitro dissolution time and the in vivo urinary excretion time for the ER formulations. The percent prediction error (%PE) on cumulative urinary excretion over the 24 h interval (Ae0-24h) and maximum urinary excretion rate (Rmax) was less than 15% for the individual formulations and less than 10% for the average of the two formulations used to develop the model. Further, the %PE values using external predictability were below 10%.
3:::Peptides 25 (241-251) and 29 (282-296) induced the highest IL-10 production by CD4 T cells. These peptides also inhibited the peak T cell proliferative response. 6 and 10 weeks after peptide inhalation, the total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a in mice treated with both peptides 241-251 and 282-296 were significantly higher than control (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference in the mean hematocrit between of the peptide-treated mice and the control group was found.
3:::We found a significant interaction between specific PM2.5 compositions and airborne pollen. Specifically, the odds ratio of daily clinic visits for pollinosis per interquartile increase in pollen concentration (39.8 grains/cm(2)) at the average cumulative lag of 0 and 2 days during high levels of non-sea-salt Ca(2+) was 1.446 (95% CI: 1.323-1.581), compared to 1.075 (95% CI: 1.067-1.083) when only moderate levels were observed. This result remained significant when other air pollutants were incorporated into the model and was fairly persistent even when different percentile cut-off points were used. A similar interaction was found when we stratified the data according to non-sea-salt SO4(2-) levels. This finding differed from estimates made according to PM2.5 and NO3(-) levels, which predicted that the effects of pollen were strongest in the lower levels.
3:::The main reasons for students to become nurses were the caring aspect, personal experiences with healthcare, role models in their immediate environment, and job opportunities. They had both altruistic and professional perceptions of their profession. Reasons for attrition were strongly related to the training programme and to their clinical placements, in particular the perceived lack of support from mentors and team. Feelings of being welcomed and working in a nice team proved to be more important reasons for completing the programme than the specific clinical field.
3:::In the first year that recreational marijuana was legal in Colorado, 71.4% of respondents tried a new marijuana or hashish product, and 53.6% used an edible product. Trial of new products was associated with greater odds of experiencing an unexpected high after controlling for age, gender, education, mental health status, current marijuana or hashish use, and mean amount of marijuana or hashish consumed in the past month (OR=2.13, p<0.001). Individuals who reported having used edibles had greater odds of experiencing an unexpected high, after controlling for the same set of variables (OR=1.56, p<0.05).
3:::The mean age was 29.6 ± 10.1 years. Surgical indications were mainly persistence or recurrence of pneumothorax. Sixty-seven patients (19%) presented with complications. At the 30-day control, 60.1% of patients were asymptomatic; 85% of patients were satisfied with the single small scar. The recurrence rate was 3.6% at 24 ± 13 months.
3:::Of the 81,447 women, 666 (0.82%) had PPD. PPD risk was higher in women who discontinued breastfeeding than in those who continued breastfeeding (hazard ratio=3.23, P<0.0001), in women with cesarean section delivery than in those with vaginal delivery (hazard ratio=1.26, P=0.0040), and in women with cesarean section delivery who discontinued breastfeeding than in those with vaginal delivery who continued breastfeeding (hazard ratio=4.92, P<0.0001).
3:::Vein cross-sectional area, shortest vein diameter, and longest vein diameter were significantly increased in the active warming group compared with the passive warming group (p <0.01). Tourniquet application after local warming was superior to tourniquet application alone in increasing vein cross-sectional, shortest diameter, and longest diameter (between-group differences of 2.2mm(2), 0.5mm, and 0.5mm, respectively), and in raising skin temperature (between-group difference: 5.2°C). However, there were no significant differences in body temperature, pulse, or systolic or diastolic blood pressure between the groups. There were no adverse events associated with either intervention.
3:::Mostly occurring among young people at weekends, binge drinking increases the risk of both acute (e.g. injuries) and long-term negative consequences (e.g. alcohol disorders). Binge drinkers tend to be extrovert, impulsive and sensation-seeking. Stress, anxiety, traumatic events and depression are also related to binge drinking. Both alcohol-related behaviour of parents and general parenting (e.g. parenting styles, monitoring) are also important. Other major risk factors for binge drinking are frequently spending time with friends who drink, and the drinking norms observed in the wider social environment (e.g. school, community, culture). Emergency departments, birthday parties, fraternities and the workplace serve as settings for interventions; these are increasingly delivered via digital and mobile technology. There is evidence of small-sized effects across approaches (brief interventions, personalised normative feedback, protective behavioural strategies etc.) and populations.
3:::The optimization and validation of this method to track long-term cell proliferation assays have been achieved with high reproducibility, without cell cycle disruption. This method has been successfully applied in several adherent and suspension cells including hard-to-transfect cells and isolated human primary lymphocytes.
3:::Sixty-eight patients agreed to participate but only 28 (41%) engaged in a prescribed social activity. There was no statistically significant difference in GP contacts (visits to GP, home visits or telephone calls) or number of new repeat prescriptions between referral and completion of 12 weeks of social prescribing activity. Similarly there was no statistically significant difference in the total number of repeat prescriptions between referral and 6-12 months after social prescribing activity in either intention to treat or per protocol analyses. Social prescribing participants had similar demographic factors. Mental health issues (anxiety and/or depression) were more common among participants than those who were referred but declined participation in a social prescribing activity (P = 0.022).
3:::The searches resulted in 1238 articles from which 7 met all the inclusion criteria. The trials involved 370 older adults (68.7±1.7years), healthy and with peripheral arterial disease. Studies included resistance and endurance exercises as well as walking sessions. Training sessions were 2-6 time per week, lasted 3-24 months and with different training intensity throughout studies. After a long-term resistance training, healthy older adults showed enhanced muscle oxygen extraction capacity, regulation of vessels and vascular endothelium function; endurance training is reported to improve microvascular blood flow and matching of oxygen delivery to oxygen utilization, muscle oxidative capacity and muscle saturation, and walking sessions results in better muscle oxygen availability and muscle oxygen extraction capacity in older adults with peripheral arterial disease.
3:::Weight Loss Only participants lost an average of 2.2 kg (P < 0.001). Weight Loss Plus participants lost an average of 3.2 kg (P < 0.001). The proportion of the total sample that lost at least 5% of their body weight was 27.1% with no difference between treatment groups. Similarly, we observed statistically significant reductions in blood pressure, waist circumference and triglycerides in each treatment group, with no statistical differences between groups.
3:::In detection of adhesive capsulitis, sensitivity is 76.7% and specificity is 53.3% for coracohumeral ligament thickening, sensitivity is 66.7% and specificity is 55.2% for coracohumeral ligament thickening and rotator interval infiltration, and sensitivity is 23.3% and specificity is 86.7% for coracohumeral ligament thickening, rotator interval infiltration, and axillary recess thickening/edema.
3:::Mean OSDI scores increased from 5.52 to 8.54 (P = 0.016), corneal fluorescence staining scores increased from 0.05 to 0.25 (P = 0.034), first noninvasive tear breakup time (NIBUT-F) decreased from 9.66 to 7.33 seconds (P = 0.014), and average noninvasive tear breakup time (NIBUT-Ave) decreased from 12.32 to 10.26 seconds (P = 0.047) 1 month after CRS. Meanwhile, mean total blink frequency in 20 seconds decreased significantly from 12.62 to 6.31 (P < 0.001); LLT did not change significantly (P = 0.447). The change in NIBUT-Ave was positively correlated with that in LLT (P = 0.003) and negatively correlated with that in the partial blink rate (P = 0.013). The changes in the OSDI questionnaire, NIBUT, LLT, and blink pattern were not different between the laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis and laser-assisted subepithelial keratomileusis groups.
3:::Drug use disorders (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]=2.68), as well as borderline, antisocial, and schizotypal personality disorders (AORs=2.50-4.10), were associated with increased likelihood of drinking despite health problems among individuals with liver disease, all ps<0.05. Any anxiety disorder trended toward significance (AOR=2.22), p=0.06, but major depressive disorder was not associated with increased risk, (AOR=0.99), ps=0.97. Individuals with a family history of alcohol problems were also more likely to drink despite health problems (AOR=2.79), p<0.05.
3:::A total of 149 eligible women were approached, 125 (84%) consented and enrolled (ages = 21-65 years). Forty-seven (44%) reported participating in some type of anal-related sexual practice: anal fingering, oral-anal penetration, or anal intercourse. Of those participating in anal-related practices, 5 (11%) reported only anal fingering or oral-anal penetration. Thus, adding the new anal questions detected an additional 5% of women with high-risk anal behaviors that may have been missed by the standard question (p = .06). Seventy-nine women (63%) reported receiving oral penetration of the vagina, and 102 (82%) reported receiving vaginal fingering. Fifty-nine women (47%) used sex toys: 58 (98%) used sex toys vaginally, with 5 (8.5%) using them also anally.
3:::Fifteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria. For the comparison of simulation-based training to other learning strategies on nurses skills, six studies in the meta-analysis showed a significant, but small effect in favour of simulation (SMD -1.09, CI -1.72 to -0.47). There was large heterogeneity (I(2) 85%). For the other comparisons, there was large between-study variation in results. The quality of evidence for all comparisons was graded as low.'
3:::The search resulted in 3495 references, of which 27 studies were included in the final analysis. The studies described 845 EoE patients, including 87 paediatric patients, who underwent a total of 1820 oesophageal dilations. The median number of dilations was 3 (range: 1-35). Clinical improvement occurred in 95% of patients (95% CI: 90%-98%, I(2) : 10%, 17 studies). Perforation occurred in 0.38% (95% CI: 0.18%-0.85%, I(2) : 0%, 27 studies), haemorrhage in 0.05% (95% CI: 0%-0.3%, I(2) : 0%, 18 studies), and hospitalisation in 0.67% (95% CI: 0.3%-1.1%, I(2) : 44%, 24 studies). No deaths occurred (95% CI: 0%-0.2% I(2) : 0%, 25 studies).
3:::A total of 3524 patients were enrolled with a median follow-up of 13 (6-20) months. Overall, 70% (60-85) of patients in ATP-guided ablation vs. 63% (48-79) in no ATP-guided ablation were free of atrial fibrillation at follow-up. Pooled results revealed that ATP-guided ablation reduced the risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence of 42% [odds ratio (OR) 0.58, 0.41-0.81], but this result was primary because of the contribution of retrospective over-randomized studies [OR 0.48 (0.35-0.65) vs. 0.76 (0.42-1.40), respectively]. 3.2% of patients experienced an adverse event. ATP-guided ablation is related to a nonsignificant increase in fluoroscopy time (OR 1.71, 0.98-2.96) and to a significant increase in procedure time (OR 2.84, 1.32-6.09).
3:::One hundred and fourteen participants completed the CAMCI, of which 38 (33.3%) participants additionally completed the MOCA and 41CT. The median (IQR) percentile score for CAMCI for all 114 participants was 33.5 (18.3, 49.8), which corresponds to moderately low risk of impairment. The median (IQR) for the MOCA was 22.0 (19, 24.8) out of a possible 30, which is considered indicative of abnormal cognitive function, and for the 41CT was 6 (5, 7) out of a possible 7 points when all 38 participants were included. MOCA correlated strongly with the overall CAMCI score (r=0.71); the CAMCI correlated moderately strongly with the 41CT (r=0.62) and the MOCA and 41CT were moderately strongly correlated with each other (r=0.56). When all 114 CAMCI scores were considered, the Executive Accuracy subscale was strongly correlated with the overall CAMCI score (r=0.81).
3:::One in four adolescents (25%) reported to have LTID and one in eight adolescents (12.5%) reported sports injuries. The odds for adolescents with chronic conditions, functional and learning difficulties was the highest (OR 3.55, CI = 2.3-5.4) for overall injuries, when compared with adolescents without LTID. Adolescents with affected LTID (OR = 2.08, CI = 1.5-2.9) were more likely to report medically attended injuries than adolescents without LTID. Sports-related injuries (OR = 0.33, CI = 0.1-0.8) were lower in adolescents with affected LTID than those without LTID after adjusting for personal and environmental factors.
3:::The psychomotor development index (PDI) and the mental development index (MDI) at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months of age were not significantly associated with maternal mobile phone use during pregnancy. However, among children exposed to high maternal BLL in utero, there was a significantly increased risk of having a low PDI up to 36 months of age, in relation to an increasing average calling time (p-trend=0.008). There was also a risk of having decreasing MDI up to 36 months of age, in relation to an increasing average calling time or frequency during pregnancy (p-trend=0.05 and 0.007 for time and frequency, respectively). There was no significant association between child neurodevelopment and prenatal RFR exposure measured by PEM in all subjects or in groups stratified by maternal BLL during pregnancy.
3:::Latent class analysis identified a high and low risk profile. Domains of primary influence included substance use, sexual assault, same-sex behavior, and unsafe sex. The high-risk group was 11 times more likely to have made a suicide attempt, five times more likely to report a history of suicidal ideation and behavior, and three times more likely to report recent suicidal ideation and behavior.
3:::Cross-sectional analysis revealed that posterior cingulate hypometabolism, diagnosis, male sex, and antidepressant use were associated with higher apathy scores. Longitudinal analysis revealed that the interaction of supramarginal hypometabolism and time, posterior cingulate hypometabolism, and antidepressant use were associated with higher apathy scores across time; only supramarginal hypometabolism was positively related to rate of increase of apathy.
3:::In cultured neurons, insulin, Gla, and Det increased phosphorylation of Akt and enhanced gene expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor to a similar extent, although Deg was less effective. The effects of Det and Deg, but not insulin and Gla were suppressed by addition of albumin. When the drug was centrally administered, the increasing effects of insulin on the Akt phosphorylation were comparable to those of Gla but greater than those of Det in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of diabetic db/db and non-diabetic db/m+ mice. Moreover, insulin and Gla enhanced memory functions in Y-maze test and suppressed depression-like behavior in forced swim test in normal mice to a similar extent, and these effects were more potent than those of Det.
3:::Prior to treatment, non-responders displayed hyper-connectivity in ACC/VMPFC, PCC/pC, dACC and insula within RSNs that have been associated with MDD pathology. Regression results showed that regions associated with clinical improvements overlapped largely with regions that showed aberrant connectivity. ACC/VMPFC, dACC and left insula, which are hub regions of DMN and SN, exhibited excellent performance (highest sensitivity=100% and highest specificity=82%) in discriminating the response status of the patients.
3:::Markers of collagen type I synthesis (PICP and PINP) were almost homogenously increased over the 3- and 12-month period, whereas PIIINP values decreased and PIIICP levels were unchanged in new-onset and chronic DCM, and in pts with and without ECM fibrosis. Both TGF-β and CTGF levels decreased over the observation period. Kinetics of serum markers of collagen synthesis and fibrosis controlling factors did not differ between DCM pts categorized according to disease duration and fibrosis status.
3:::We established a prognostic scale using the MMSE, m-NIHSS, TCT, and KES/BW-US. A score of 56.8 or higher on the prognostic scale suggested that the patient would be able to walk and that assistance with ADL would be unnecessary at the time of hospital discharge. In addition, a score of 41.3 points indicated that the patients return home was feasible. The reliability and the results were in good agreement. These findings showed that the ability or inability to walk was predictable in 85%, the need of assistance with ADL in 82.5%, and the feasibility of home return in 76.3% of cases.'
3:::One-hundred and sixty patients with mRCC, received axitinib in second (40%) or further next-line therapy (60%). International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk group classification was good, intermediate and poor in 13%, 54% and 32%, respectively. Dose titration (DT) to 7 mg twice a day (bid) was performed in 38% and to 10 mg bid in 19% of the patients. Hypertension was the most common adverse event, (grade (G)3: 39%; G4: 2%). ORR occurred in 32% (n = 33, only partial response). Median PFS, TTF and OS were 8.3, 5.8 and 16.4 months, respectively. IMDC risk group and DT at 2 weeks are associated to ORR while grade 3 hypertension is marginally associated. IMDC risk group and grade 3 hypertension are significantly associated with better PFS, TTF and OS while DT at 2 weeks is associated to PFS and TTF.
3:::At baseline, perfusion was similar among the three groups. During post-ischemic phase, microcirculatory perfusion significantly increased in controls compared to baseline (baseline perfusion units [PU] 3.65±1.8 to 4.59±2.1 during hyperemia; p for trend=0.041), whereas in ARDS group perfusion tended to decrease. Comparing results across groups, ARDS showed lower values compared to either controls or Cardio groups (p<0.05). Controls, and to a lesser extent Cardio group, showed recruitable MFR (1.78±1.13 and 1.19±0.30 in controls and Cardio group, respectively). MFR was absent in ARDS (0.88±0.48; p<0.05), documenting impaired microcirculatory response.
3:::We examined 13 557 children at a median age of 16.2 years (48.5% were girls). The intervention substantially increased breastfeeding duration and exclusivity compared with the control arm (exclusively breastfed: 45% vs 6% at 3 months, respectively). Mean differences at 16 years between intervention and control groups were 0.21 (95% CI, 0.06-0.36) for BMI; 0.21 kg/m2 (95% CI, -0.03 to 0.44) for fat mass index; 0.00 kg/m2 (95% CI, -0.21 to 0.22) for fat-free mass index; 0.71% (95% CI, -0.32 to 1.74) for percentage body fat; -0.73 cm (-2.48 to 1.02) for waist circumference; 0.05 cm (95% CI, -0.85 to 0.94) for height; -0.54 mm Hg (95% CI, -2.40 to 1.31) for systolic BP; and 0.71 mm Hg (95% CI, -0.68 to 2.10) for diastolic BP. The odds ratio for overweight/obesity (BMI ≥85th percentile vs <85th percentile) was 1.14 (95% CI, 1.02-1.28) and the odds ratio for obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile vs <95th percentile) was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.92-1.29). The intervention resulted in a more rapid rate of gain in postinfancy height (1 to 2.8 years), weight (2.8 to 14.5 years), and BMI (2.8 to 8.5 years) compared with the control arm. The intervention had little effect on BMI z score changes after 8.5 years.
3:::Hyposmia was reported by all laryngectomees and hypogeusia by 54% of patients. Sniffin Sticks and Taste Strips tests demonstrated a statistically significant difference between controls and laryngectomees regarding olfactory threshold, odor discrimination and identification, Threshold Discrimination Identification (TDI) score, and sour, salty, and gustatory Total Taste score ( P < .05). Multivariate analysis for Total Taste score in laryngectomees showed a statistically significant correlation with aging, having an odds ratio of 0.127 for age ≥65 years, but not with TDI score, radiotherapy, and follow-up time, whereas multivariate analysis for TDI score demonstrated no correlation with radiotherapy, age, and follow-up time.'
3:::Compared with healthy controls, the results showed that PMS patients had increased fALFF in bilateral precuneus, left hippocampus and left inferior temporal cortex, and decreased fALFF in bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and cerebellum at luteal phase. Moreover, the DRSP scores of PMS patients were negatively correlated with the mean fALFF in ACC and positively correlated with the fALFF in precuneus.
3:::We found low preoperative BMD in ROI1 to be significantly related to high MTPM at all follow-ups: after 3 months (R(2) = 20%, PBMD = 0.017), 6 months (R(2) = 29%, PBMD = 0.003), 12 months (R(2) = 33%, PBMD = 0.001), and 24 months (R(2) = 27%, PBMD = 0.001). We also found a significant relation for low BMD in ROI2 and high MTPM: 3 months (R(2) = 19%, PBMD = 0.042), 6 months (R(2) = 28%, PBMD = 0.04), 12 months (R(2) = 32%, PBMD = 0.004), and 24 months (R(2) = 24%, PBMD = 0.005).
3:::Stopping criteria were met at 1.00 mg/kg dose. No serious adverse events were reported. Adverse events were dose-dependent and comprised involuntary muscle movement, tachycardia, and ventilatory effects. Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation evoked a physiologic cortisol response in all subjects, no different from placebo. Pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional. A three-compartment pharmacokinetic model described the data well. A rapid onset of anesthesia/sedation after bolus administration and also a rapid recovery were observed. A quantitative concentration-effect relationship was described for the modified observers assessment of alertness/sedation and Bispectral Index.'
3:::Regression analyses found moderation of group differences by RS for three outcomes: social participation, self-perceptions of social acceptance, and externalizing behavior problems. Conditional effects at varying levels of RS indicated that externalizing problems and social participation were significantly worse for children with STBI at high levels of RS, compared to children with OI. Social participation for the STBI group remained significantly lower than the OI group at mean levels of RS, but not at low levels of RS. At high levels of RS, self-perceptions of social acceptance were lower for children with moderate TBI compared to OI, but group differences were not significant at mean or low levels of RS. No evidence of moderation was found for global self-worth, self-perceptions of physical appearance or athletic ability, or internalizing problems.
3:::Ninety patients were studied. Forty-one of ninety (45%) were sarcopenic; of these, 17 (41.5%) had a normal body mass index and 8 (19.5%) were overweight/obese. More men were sarcopenic (68% versus 32%, P < 0.001). CRP was higher and albumin lower in sarcopenic subjects. Sarcopenia did not predict outcomes in the cohort but was the only significant predictor of need for surgery in overweight and obese subjects (P = 0.002).
3:::A total of 64 badges were sampled, with no methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) cultured on any of the badges. Two of 64 had enterococcus (3%), and 1 of those was vancomycin resistant. Pagers had similar results, with only 1/42 growing MSSA or enterococcus (2.4%), and no MRSA. Lanyards showed higher rates of contamination. There were 11% with MSSA or MRSA out of 27 sampled. Highest contamination rates were with orthopedic staff and resident lanyards, with 3/22 (13.6%) growing MSSA or MRSA. No lanyards grew enterococcus. When comparing rates of MSSA and/or MRSA between groups, lanyards had a statistically significant higher rate (P < .05).
3:::Everolimus treatment resulted in rapid reduction in tumor size, symptomatic improvement, and decrease in cerebrospinal fluid protein.
3:::The annual traumatic death rate for the Top End was 58.7 per 100 000, with variance between regions (accessible 38.1; remote 119.1 per 100000, respectively). Overall alcohol was involved in 56.5% of cases. The three most frequent mechanisms of death were suicide, transport related and assault, accounting for 81.5% of deaths. These respective mechanisms of death demonstrated seasonal influence, with transport related deaths 2.5 times more likely to occur in the dry than the wet season (p < 0.001), while assault related deaths were 3.3 times more likely to occur during the wet season (p = 0.005), and suicide was 1.6 times more likely to occur during the wet season (p = 0.022). Transport related deaths were 2.2 times more likely in remote and very remote settings than in accessible or moderately accessible regions (p < 0.003), whereas death by suicide was less likely to occur in remote and very remote regions than in accessible or moderately accessible areas (p = 0.012).
3:::The size of the phase separated domains for the ITZ-HPMC ASDs was affected by the solvent evaporation rate. Smaller domains (<10 nm) were observed in spray-dried ASDs, whereas larger domains (>30 nm) were found in ASDs prepared using slower evaporation rates. Confocal imaging provided visual confirmation of phase separation along with chemical specificity, achieved by selectively staining drug-rich and polymer-rich phases. ssNMR confirmed the results of fluorescence-based techniques and provided information on the size of phase separated domains.
3:::Average LOS was 1.24 days (range 1-14); 86.1% discharged on day 1; 96.9% by day 2, a value comparable or better than that of other ERAS studies vs standard care according to meta-analysis. Complications 2.9%; readmission 2.1%; reintervention 1.3%.
3:::A total of 373 DEGs including 342 up- and 31 down-regulated genes were identified. These DEGs were significantly enriched in pathways of protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Finally, the most significant regulatory TFs were obtained, including E2F Transcription Factor 1 (E2F1), GA Binding Protein Transcription Factor (GABP), Nuclear Factor, Erythroid 2-Like 2 (NRF2) and ELK1, Member of ETS Oncogene Family (ELK1).
3:::There were 240 patients with lung cancer and 68 patients with other diseases. The operations included 49 wedge resections, 58 segmentectomies, and 201 lobectomies. A postoperative air leak was observed in 61 patients (20%). A prolonged air leak exceeding 20 mL/min lasting 5 days or more was observed in 18 patients (5.8%). Multivariate analysis of various perioperative factors showed forced expiratory volume in 1 second below 70%, patterns of air leakage, defined as exacerbating and remitting or without a trend toward improvement, and peak air leakage of 100 mL/min or more were significant positive predictors of prolonged air leak. Fluctuations in pleural pressure occurred just after the air leakage rate decreased to less than 20 mL/min.
3:::In 1994-1996, men aged 51-65 years (16,872) were invited to SPGI assay and 12,175 men (72%) attended. SPGI was 25 microg/l or less in 610 (5%) men, indicating severe atrophic gastritis (AG). Post-screening gastroscopy was performed to 435 men with low SPGI. Of these, 168 men were referred for treatment due to abnormal focal lesions. Attributable proportions in reductions of SMR and PYLL from gastric cancer due to screening were 59% and 67%. After correcting for selective participation, attributable proportions were reduced to 23% and 39%.
3:::101 patients were included. Wrist MRI altered management in 86% (95% CI: 77-92%) and diagnosis in 46% (36-56%) of patients. MRI changed both diagnosis and management in 41% (31-51%), changed management only in 46% (35-56%), changed diagnosis only in 5% (2-12%), and had no change in diagnosis or management in 9% (95% CI: 4-17%).
3:::AN patients and HCs differed in all affective temperaments. The diagnostic subtypes of AN differed as well with binge-purging individuals being more cyclothymic and anxious than those with restricting-type AN. TEMPS-A scores correlated with body mass index and eating psychopathology but not with duration of illness. Concerning comorbidity, grater scores on the depressive and lower scores on the hyperthymic temperaments were found in depressed patients. Those who had either an anxious or irritable temperament were significantly more diagnosed with an anxious disorder than those who did not show this temperament. When logistic regression was performed, high depressive/low hyperthymic and high irritable/anxious traits resulted to be associated with depressive and anxious comorbidity, respectively, independently of confounding factors.
3:::Seven articles met the inclusion criteria. All included studies were case series of moderate quality with a mean Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies score of 12/16. Overall, 94% (119/126) of patients undergoing OAT for OCD lesions of the capitellum successfully returned to competitive sports. The mean reported time for unrestricted return to athletic competition after OAT was 5.6 months (range, 3-14 months).
3:::Deguelin inhibited migration and invasion processes in NSCLC cell lines and decreased NEK2 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, NEK2 knockdown inhibited NSCLC cell migration and invasion. Finally, overexpressing NEK2 in NCI-H520 and SK-MES-1 cells could restore the inhibition of metastasis induced by deguelin.
3:::One hundred eighty and 188 matching research and clinical echocardiogram reports were available for the 7-day and 36-week PMA studies. At least one of the specific qualitative measures of PVD was missing from 54% of the clinical reports. PVD was diagnosed at 7 days in 31% and 20% of research and clinical interpretations, respectively (PABAK score of 0.54). At 36 weeks, PH was diagnosed in 15.6% and 17.8% of research and clinical interpretations, respectively (PABAK score of 0.80).
3:::We demonstrated that IL-6 is secreted by monocyte-lineage cells in response to CAR T-cell activation in a contact-independent mechanism upon T-cell engagement of target leukemia. We observed that the presence of antigen-presenting cell-derived IL-6 has no impact on CAR T-cell transcriptional profiles or cytotoxicity. Finally, we confirm that CAR T cells do not secrete IL-6 in vivo during clinical CRS.
3:::The lengths of ELM, EZ and IZ defects correlated significantly with BCVA in each study period (P < 0.001). Preoperative measures of these band defects were also associated with visual outcomes 3 and 6 months after surgery (P < 0.05). Considering all preoperative parameters, the length of the ELM defect was the factor most strongly correlated with BCVA at 6 months (β = 0.643, P < 0.012). The integrity of the ELM was the only factor significantly associated with BCVA at 6 months (β = 0.427; P = 0.004).
3:::13.9% of the participants reported personal history of thyroid disease. MD was not associated to hyperthyroidism (e(β):1.05, 95%CI: 0.82-1.36), hypothyroidism (e(β):1.02, 95%CI: 0.75-1.38), thyroid nodules (e(β):1.01, 95%CI: 0.85-1.19) or thyroid cancer (e(β):1.03, 95%CI: 0.56-1.92). However, women with goiter had lower MD (mean MDno-goiter: 13.4% vs mean MDgoiter: 10.6%; e(β):0.79, 95%CI: 0.64-0.98) and those with Hashimoto thyroiditis had higher MD (mean MDno-thyroiditis: 13.3% vs mean MDthyroidits: 25.8%; e(β):1.94, 95%CI: 1.00-3.77).
3:::A total of 847 responses on 11 cases were received. Depending upon the vignette, the proportion of responses within each case that did not have an ICD-10 seizure code ranged from 3% to 62%. G40.9 (Epilepsy, unspecified) resulted from 43% of responses, and R56.8 (Other and unspecified convulsion) resulted from 38% of responses.
3:::Nearly all states set minimum varieties and quantities of fruits and vegetables, 100% juice, whole grain-rich foods, breakfast cereal, milk, cheese, eggs, legumes, and peanut butter. Fewer states set requirements for canned fish, yogurt, and tofu. Most measures had a large range in minimum requirements (e.g., $8-$100 of fruits and vegetables, 60-144 oz of breakfast cereal).
3:::Arytenoid abduction (higher LRQ) was greater with FASTak II construct than either of the suture patterns. The largest difference occurred at 5N. Approximately 50% less force was required to achieve an LRQ of 1.0 with the FASTak II anchor compared to the suture patterns. No difference was detected between the 2 suture constructs throughout the study.
3:::Qualitative image quality was significantly higher using 3rd generation DSCT as compared to 2nd generation (p < 0.001). Mean attenuation in the proximal coronary arteries was also significantly higher on 3rd generation DSCT than for 2nd generation (586 HU vs. 426 HU in the left main coronary artery (LM), p < 0.001). Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) values, however, were lower in 3rd generation DSCT than 2nd generation (SNR 11.2 [9.9-13.4] vs 13.5 [11.0-15.5] and CNR 12.4 [10.9-14.8] vs 15.2 [12.8-17.9] in the LM, p < 0.001). Median effective dose was also lower for 3rd generation DSCT than for 2nd generation (2.9 [2.3-5.0] mSv and 3.7 mSv [2.5-5.7], respectively) although this trend did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.065).
3:::The PubMed search resulted in 137 articles, of which 11 articles and 4 cited publications were included in our analysis. We found 53 cases of IBD after anti-TNF-α therapy reported in the literature; most of them were case series collected retrospectively from national databases or studies. Almost all the patients developed IBD after the introduction of etanercept (ETN); 2 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were also included. The average age at IBD onset was 17.3 years and the average time from ETN introduction to IBD onset was 27 months (± 24). Gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported as improving or subsiding in most of the patients after discontinuing ETN.
3:::Compared with white individuals, South Asians had a faster increase in FPG before diagnosis (slope difference 0.22 mmol/l per decade; 95% CI 0.02, 0.42; p = 0.03) and a higher FPG level at diagnosis (0.27 mmol/l; 95% CI 0.06, 0.48; p = 0.01). They also had higher FSI and 2hSI levels before and at diabetes diagnosis. South Asians had a faster decline and lower HOMA2-S (log e -transformed) at diagnosis compared with white individuals (0.33; 95% CI 0.21, 0.46; p < 0.001). HOMA2-B increased in both ethnic groups until 7 years before diagnosis and then declined; the initial increase was faster in white individuals. ISI0,120 declined steeply in both groups before diagnosis; levels were lower among South Asians before and at diagnosis. There were no ethnic differences in 2hPG trajectories.
3:::Our cross-sectional study indicated an increased risk of (near) accidents if imaging technicians had worked with MRI in the year prior to the survey (odds ratio OR 2.13, 95%CI 1.23-3.69). Risks were higher in persons who worked with MRI more often (OR 2.32, 95%CI 1.25-4.31) compared to persons who worked sometimes with MRI (OR 1.91, 95%CI 0.98-3.72), and higher in those who had likely experienced higher peak exposures to static and time-varying magnetic fields (OR 2.18, 95%CI 1.06-4.48). The effect was seen on commuting accidents that had occurred on the commute from home to work as well as accidents from work to home or elsewhere.
3:::There were 204 outpatients with SLE enrolled in the study and 162 completed a retest. PROMIS CAT showed good performance characteristics and moderate to strong correlations with similar domains in the 2 legacy instruments (r = -0.49 to 0.86, p < 0.001). However, correlations between PROMIS CAT and the SELENA-SLEDAI disease activity and SDI were generally weak and statistically insignificant. PROMIS CAT test-retest ICC were good to excellent, ranging from 0.72 to 0.88.
3:::Total search results yielded 2574 records. Of these, 12 studies were identified and reviewed. Two were randomised controlled trials and the remaining 10 were one-group pretest/posttest designs or posttest-only designs, including self-report evaluations of communication skills training and objective evaluations of trainee skills. There were no studies with outcomes related to behaviour change or patient outcomes. Two randomised controlled trials reported an improvement in clinician empathy and psychotherapeutic interviewing skills due to specific training protocols focused on those areas. Non-randomised studies showed varying levels of skills gains and self-reported trainee satisfaction ratings with programmes, with the intervention being some form of communication skills training.
3:::Nine boys and 3 girls (average age, 10.6 years; range, 5 years 7 months-16 years 2 months) were included in the study. Initial displacement and angulation of the fractures were 5 mm (2-7 mm) and 12° (4°-25°), respectively. Two cases had radial neck fractures of the ipsilateral elbow. All patients had a perfect Mayo Elbow Performance Score after 8 weeks postoperatively. Pin removals were performed at 13.1 weeks. No complications, including growth arrest, were observed.
3:::Twenty-four patients between ages two and 18 years were identified. Psychosis was a primary presenting symptom in two thirds of patients, and just over 20% of these were admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility. Ultimately, all patients developed psychiatric symptoms during the course of the illness. There was a characteristic progression of symptoms that was consistent with that noted in other studies, with prominent psychiatric symptoms initially, which then progressed to seizures and autonomic instability in most patients. All of those examined developed movement abnormalities, which included primarily orofacial dyskinesias and choreiform movements.
3:::Seventy-six of the 181 patients (42.0%) underwent immediate surgery. A Gastrografin® challenge was initialized in 105 of the 181 patients (58.0%). Twenty of these 105 patients (19.1%) with persisting or progressive symptoms and absence of contrast agent in the colon after 12 and 24 h subsequently underwent surgery. Here, a segmental bowel resection was necessary in 6 of these 20 patients (30.0%). In 16 out of 20 patients (80.0%) who failed the Gastrografin® challenge, a corresponding correlate in terms of a strangulation was detected intraoperatively. The Gastrografin® challenge had a specificity of 96% and a sensitivity of 100%; accuracy to predict the need for exploration was 96%.
3:::Serum phosphate correlated inversely with weight, BMI and fat mass across all three cohorts (r = -0·13 to -0·31, P < 0·0001-0·02). Associations were diminished after adjustment for PTH, but remained significant. In the FGF23 Cohort, FGF23 was positively correlated with weight (r = 0·60, P = 0·007) and BMI (r = 0·49, P = 0·03). Phosphate was inversely associated with BMD in Female Cohorts 1 and 2 (r = -0·08 to -0·29, P < 0·0001-0·02). This relationship was attenuated, but remained significant at most sites, following adjustment for age, fat mass, renal function and 25-hydroxyvitamin D.
3:::Preliminary results indicated that patients with an EF ≤ 35% had a significantly greater risk of developing life-threatening arrhythmias, and were much more likely to suffer from cardiogenic shock. Patients often required varying forms of mechanical respiratory support. The in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, 1-year mortality and ongoing long-term mortality was significantly higher in TTS patients with an EF ≤ 35%. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, an EF ≤ 35% (HR 3·3, 95% CI: 1·2-9·2, P < 0·05) was identified as a strong independent predictor of the primary endpoint.
3:::The prevalence of depression among U.S. adults is 15.08%. The two most often reported depression symptoms were ""Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much"" and ""Feeling tired or having little energy"", with rates of14.68% and 13.09%, respectively. Participants who engaged in only light physical activity were more likely to have been identified as experiencing depression and MetS than those who engaged in vigorous physical activity with odd ratios 3.18 (95% CI: 1.59, 6.37) and 3.50 (95%CI: 2.17, 5.63), respectively. Individuals in the study having poor diets were more likely to suffer from depression than those eating good diets (OR=2.17, 95%CI: 1.47, 3.22).
3:::Flow cytometry results showed significantly elevated levels of Th9 cells in reticular and erosive OLP compared to HCs. Th9 expression in erosive OLP was less than in reticular OLP, indicating that Th9 but not Th17 cells may play a predominant role in reticular disease. However, in erosive OLP patients, we found much higher levels of Th17 cells compared to reticular OLP patients and HCs, indicating that Th17 dominates in erosive OLP. Statistical analysis showed positive correlations of Th9 cells and Th17 cells in patients with reticular or erosive OLP but none in HCs.
3:::The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry-Delirium Special Interest Group determined that the VADIC demonstrated high content validity. The VADIC (1) preserved the core Diagnostic and Statistical Manual delirium criterion, (2) appropriately paired interactive assessments with key criterion based on development, and (3) addressed confounders for delirium. A cohort of 300 patients with a median age of 20 months was assessed for delirium using the VADIC. Delirium prevalence was 47%.
3:::We confirmed that TREM2 mRNA expression in leukocytes was significantly higher in AD patients than in controls (p = 0.007). The percentage methylation at three CpG sites in TREM2 intron 1 was significantly lower in AD subjects than in control: CpG1, 9.4 ± 3.2 vs 11.9 ± 4.0 (p = 0.001); CpG2, 15.4 ± 4.9 vs 19.1 ± 4.8 (p = 0.001); CpG3, 20.8 ± 5.5 vs 25.5 ± 5.4 (p < 0.001); and the average percentage methylation of all CpG sites: 13.5 ± 3.7 vs 16.1 ± 3.8 (p = 0.002), respectively. In addition, there were significant negative correlations between TREM2 mRNA expression and the percentage DNA methylation of each of CpG sites (CpG1, r = -0.416, p < 0.001; CpG2, r = -0.510, p < 0.001; CpG3, r = -0.504, p < 0.001; CpG4, r = -0.356, p < 0.001).
3:::Twelve papers met the selection criteria. Study endpoints were not consistent between papers, and most failed to report their clinical significance. A variety of tools were used to measure team skills in five papers; only one paper measured the relationship between team factors and patient outcomes. Two papers reported that equipment failures were common and had a significant impact on operating room efficiency. The influence of hospital characteristics on failure-to-rescue rates was tested in one large study, although their conclusions were limited to the American Medicare population. Five papers implemented changes in the patient pathway, but most studies failed to account for potential confounding variables.
3:::HPLC analysis of APAE revealed the presence of rutin. APAE showed significant scavenging effect on DPPH (IC50 49.37 μ g/mL) and peroxide (IC50 288.2 μ g/mL) radicals. The extract exhibited reducing potential and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. APAE treatment significantly attenuated mean increase in paw volume and exhibited inhibition of paw oedema in both in vivo models with inhibition of 45.11% and 49.42%, respectively at 5 h.
3:::Our results showed that blockade of ASIC1a using ASIC1a-siRNA inhibited acid-induced osteoclast precursor migration and adhesion, as well as osteoclast adhesion and bone resorption; we also demonstrated that inhibition of ASIC1a decreased the cell surface αvβ3 integrin and β3 protein expression. Moreover, blocking of ASIC1a inhibited acidosis-induced actin ring formation and reduced Pyk2 and Src phosphorylation in osteoclasts and also inhibited the acid-induced association of the αvβ3 integrin/Src/Pyk2.
3:::All implants were osseointegrated. Histologic measures show mineralized bone matrix in intimate contact with the implant surface in both groups. The median BIC was 57.5% (IQR 9.0) in the MDI group and 55.0% (IQR 4.5) in the control group (P > 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). There were no statistical differences in osseointegration at 6 weeks between MDIs and standard implants in rabbit tibias.
3:::The results showed that the formulated nanoparticles demonstrated attractive physicochemical properties, low cytotoxicity, potent antibacterial efficacy, and slow degradation and gradual CHX release profiles. Nanoparticles delivered efficiently inside dentinal-tubules structure to sufficient depth (>10μm) against the simulated upward pulpal hydrostatic-pressure, even after bonding-resins infiltration and were attached/retained on collagen-fibrils. These results verified the potential significance of this newly introduced drug-delivery therapeutic strategy for future clinical applications and promote for a new era of future dental research.
3:::The patients median age was 70 years, and 70 patients were cirrhotic. Three patients (3%) discontinued treatment due to adverse events. The SVR rate was 64%. Factors that significantly contributed to the SVR included the γ-glutamyl transferase and α-fetoprotein levels, interleukin- 28B (IL28B) polymorphism status, and the level and reduction of HCV RNA at weeks 2 and 4. The multivariate analysis showed that the IL28B polymorphism status was the only independent factor that predicted the SVR, with a positive predictive value of 77%.'
3:::There were 412 individuals with documented ulceration during the registration period (0.50%). The annual incidence rate of foot ulcers was 0.34% (range 0.22-1.08%). Of those individuals with a documented foot examination, 14.6% had absent pedal pulsations, 17.3% had neuropathy and 10.1% had callus/pressure marks.
3:::Clinicians evaluated a total of 285 UDS studies during the study period. The average age of study participants was 56.0 (±16.4) years, 59.5% were female, and 29.3% had a neurologic diagnosis. The most common indication for performing UDS was to discern the predominant type of urinary incontinence (stress vs urgency) in patients with mixed incontinence symptoms (38.5%) and to assess the safety of the bladder during filling (38.2%). UDS statistically significantly changed the ordering clinicians clinical impression of the patient's lower urinary tract diagnosis for stress urinary incontinence and for urgency and urgency urinary incontinence (both had P values of <.05). Fluoroscopy was found to be helpful in 29.5% of urodynamic studies, and clinicians reported that UDS changed their treatment plans in 42.5% of the studies, most commonly pertaining to changes related to surgery (35.0%).'
3:::The odds of being retained in treatment ≥90days increased with age (5% increase with each year of age; p<0.001), adjusting for other sociodemographic factors. Clients who reported unstable housing had a 41% decreased odds of remaining in treatment for 90 or more days compared to clients who lived independently at intake. Treatment success did not significantly differ by several other client-level characteristics including gender, race, employment, legal issues and incarceration.
3:::From January to July 2016, 2234 patients suspected of having ZIKV infection were reported in both affected and control areas. A total of 1110 patients had a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay, and 159 were positive for ZIKV. The cumulative incidence of ZIKV in the affected area was 11.1 per 100 000 after the earthquake. The odds ratio of having ZIKV infection in those living in the affected area was 8.0 (95% CI = 4.4, 14.6; P < .01) compared with the control area and adjusted for age, gender, province population, and number of government health care facilities.
3:::Ansan Danwon showed a significantly greater increase (5.6%) in the prescription rate of antidepressants compared to Cheonan city following the Sewol Ferry disaster. There were no significant differences in changes in the prescription rates of anxiolytics or sedatives/hypnotics. In the secondary analysis, a significantly greater increase in the prescription rate of antipsychotics was observed in Ansan Danwon compared to a control community after the disaster.
3:::There were 54,534 admissions: the no-consultation group (N = 53,196) and the consultation group (N = 1,398). English as PL was more common in the consult group (72.0% of consult group, 62.0% of no-consult group, χ(2) = 92.98, p < 0.0001). Spanish speakers were underrepresented in the consult group (14.2% of consult, 25.8% of no-consult, χ(2) = 98.78, p < 0.0001).
3:::All pulmonary veins were successfully isolated. The procedure time was 125 mins with a fluoroscopy time of 44.3 mins. The fluoro dose was 2095cGycm2. There were no procedural complications.
3:::The differences in aT-ADC between MRI protocols were negated by sT-ADC. The best sT-ADC cut-offs to predict cancer aggressiveness in the development cohort worked in the validation cohort compared to the development cohort.
3:::The challenges faced by older nurses in their practice are synthesised across three primary domains: Nursing and the ageing body; Recognition and support of the older nurse and Demands associated with middle-age.
3:::Linear regression analyses, conducted separately for MDD and GAD, indicated main effects of past-year MDD and GAD, such that those with a mental disorder reported greater functional disability than those without a mental disorder. Social support did not moderate the associations between either MDD and functional disability or GAD and functional disability.
3:::Pregnant women with high or moderate level of psychiatric symptoms had significantly more errors in visuospatial working memory/executive functioning task than mothers with low symptom level. Depressive symptoms throughout pregnancy and concurrent pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms were significant predictors of the performance in the task. General anxiety symptoms were not related to visuospatial working memory.
3:::The mean age for the subjects was 43.58±9.01years. The mean BMI was 33.4±2.1. The success rate of TVT-O operation was 21 out of 26 patients (≈81%). Normal maximum flow rate was in 88% of patients at week one and was normal in 100% of patients at months three and six (p=0.101 & 0.101). Postoperative groin pain was the main complaint during the first week after operation and decreased significantly from week one to the 1st month postoperative (84.62% & 65.38%, P=0.041).
3:::Dissociative symptoms were related to increased delta and lowered beta power. Adversity-related measures modulated theta and alpha oscillatory power (in particular childhood sexual abuse) and differed between patients and controls.
3:::We found limited change in claims for lactation classes over the study period. By contrast, the number of claims for breast pumps among women with private insurance increased from 70 claims in the third quarter of 2012 to 629 claims 1 year later and 803 claims in the third quarter of 2014. Women with Medicaid had only 11 claims for breast pumps over the entire study period.
3:::Our analysis was based on 1758 incident strokes (1311 were ischaemic and 256 were haemorrhagic). We found no evidence of an association between all stroke or ischaemic stroke and same day exposure to PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2 or NOX. For haemorrhagic stroke, we found a negative association with PM10 suggestive of a 14.6% (95% CI 0.7% to 26.5%) fall in risk per 10 µg/m(3) increase in pollutant.
3:::Sixty studies were identified and examined for evidence of benefits and disadvantages of piezoelectric surgery and its application in otolaryngology. The technique was compared with traditional surgical methods, in terms of intra-operative bleeding, histology, learning curve, operative time and post-operative pain.
3:::BmMSCs and ucMSCs showed decreasing proliferative capacity over time, while their telomere lengths and mitochondrial activity remained stable. Percentage of aneuploidy in cultures was unchanged after expansion. Furthermore, expression of MSC markers and markers associated with stress or aging remained unchanged. Reduced capacity to suppress CD4 and CD8 T-cell proliferation was observed for passage 8 and 12 bmMSCs and ucMSCs. Finally, susceptibility of bmMSCs and ucMSCs to NK-cell lysis remained stable.
3:::In 2010, 228 respondents completed the survey compared to 237 in 2015, of whom 204 were consultants (105 General or Breast Surgeons and 99 Plastic Surgeons). The range of procedures performed by Plastic Surgeons has remained static, the General and Breast Surgeons are performing proportionally more therapeutic mammaplasty (p < 0.001), breast reduction/mastopexy, and latissimus dorsi reconstructions. In 2015, surgeons are less concerned about the risks of lipomodelling than in 2010, with an increase the proportion of breast (55% vs. 26%) and plastic (91% vs. 58%) surgeons performing the technique.
3:::Controls versus SCI and MCI differed significantly regarding ETs reported as used, but not SCI versus MCI. Similarly, in ability to use ET, controls versus SCI and MCI differed significantly but not SCI versus MCI.
3:::Six thematic areas of assumed health benefits were identified: (i) quality improvement; (ii) improved risk management; (iii) reduced procurement costs; (iv) increased efficiency; (v) community involvement; and (vi) sustainable investment. Primary Care Trusts that chose to procure their surgeries through LIFT were expected to support its implementation by providing an environment conducive for the private participants to achieve these benefits. Private participant activities were found to be based on a range of explicit and tacit assumptions perceived helpful in achieving government objectives for LIFT.
3:::Severity of OCD (as indexed by higher scores on the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised) was unrelated to frequency and quantity of cannabis use, but it was significantly, positively related to increased cannabis misuse. These effects persisted after controlling for anxiety, depression, and stress. The specific feature of obsessing was found to consistently predict cannabis misuse. Finally, an indirect effect of severity of OCD on cannabis misuse via coping motives was discovered.
3:::Overall, 110 and 96 patients underwent PRT and SRVRT, respectively. The SRVRT group had more advanced disease based on FIGO stage and positive pelvic lymph nodes (PLNs). The median follow-up time was 60months (range, 7-143). For the total study population, the 5-year PALN recurrence-free survival (PARFS) and overall survival (OS) for PRT vs. SRVRT were 87.6% vs. 97.9% (p=0.03) and 74.5% vs. 87.8% (p=0.04), respectively. In patients with FIGO III-IVA or positive PLNs, the 5-year PARFS and OS for PRT vs. SRVRT were 80.1% vs. 96.4% (p=0.02) and 58.1% vs. 83.5% (p=0.012), respectively. However, there were no significant differences in these outcomes for patients with FIGO IB-IIB and negative PLNs. In a multivariate analysis, only SRVRT was associated with better PARFS (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06-0.78; p=0.02). The SRVRT did not significantly increase severe late toxicities.
3:::Of 135 patients enrolled and eligible for performance assessment on whole blood, the sensitivity was 95.7% [95% CI: 85.5-99.5] and specificity 100% [95% CI: 95.9-100]. Of the 37 symptomatic infected patients able to provide saliva and/or urine samples, 34 of the 35 saliva samples and all 3 of the urine samples were positive with the BioThreat-E test.
3:::Forty-eight percent of use-of-force interactions occurred between a White officer and a non-White civilian (White-non-White). In bivariate models, the odds of hard-empty hand control and intermediate weapon use were significantly higher among White-Black dyads compared with White-White dyads. The bivariate odds of intermediate weapon use were also significantly higher among Black-Black, Hispanic-White, Black-Hispanic, and Hispanic-Black dyads compared with White-White dyads. However, after we controlled for individual and situational factors, the relationship between race/ethnicity dyad and hard-empty hand control was no longer significant.
3:::In total, 121 patients (mean age 75, 71% females) were randomized to the study interventions. Compared with the S group, patients in the S+PAE group displayed greater improvements of MOCA total scores (p=0.006, effect size=0.37), visuospatial/executive functions (p=0.001, effect size=0.13), and disability (p=0.02, effect size=-0.31). Participants in the S+NPE group did not display significant differences with the control group.
3:::Both the knowledge and certainty construct of the KOP-Q proved unidimensional in the Netherlands and USA sample. Test results of the measurement invariance across the Netherlands and USA indicated a stable, partial scalar invariance (15 items full scalar invariance) for the knowledge items and full scalar invariance for the certainty items.
3:::The proportion of days on which there are Saharan dust intrusions rises to 30% of days. The synoptic pattern is characterised by an anticyclonic ridge extending from northern Africa to the Iberian Peninsula. Particulate matter (PM) on days with intrusions are associated with daily mortality, something that does not occur on days without intrusions, indicating that Saharan dust may be a risk factor for daily mortality. In other cases, what Saharan dust intrusions do is to change the PM-related mortality behaviour pattern, going from PM2.5.
3:::Both reduced application time and thermomechanical cycling resulted in significantly lower bond strengths, thinner hybrid layers, and significantly more extensive nanoleakage after thermomechanical cycling. Using the conventional 10-s application time improved bonding performance when compared with the no-waiting self-etch technique. Nevertheless, nanoleakage was generally extensive under all testing parameters employed for examining the adhesive.
3:::symptoms of PPD and PTSD did not significantly differ between birth groups; however, measures of subjective childbirth experience and obstetric factors did. Moderation analyses indicated a significant interaction between pain and birth group, such that higher ratings of pain among women who were transferred was associated with greater symptoms of postpartum PTSD.
3:::Following the screening process of the available literature it can be said that a) PG enlargement has been found in both BD and MDD, therefore potentially representing a common neurobiological marker characterizing mood disorders, and b) PG volumes are moderated by age and sex in both illnesses, although the direction and the extent of this moderation are still not fully clear.
3:::Smoking history, histologic subtype, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, sex, and geographic region predicted veliparib benefit in univariate analyses. In multivariate analysis, history of recent smoking was most predictive for veliparib benefit. Recent smokers treated with veliparib derived significantly greater progression-free survival and overall survival benefits (HR = 0.38 [p < 0.01] and HR = 0.43 [p < 0.01]) than former smokers (HR = 2.098 [p = 0 0208] and HR = 1.62 [p = 0.236]) and never-smokers (HR = 1.025 [p = 0.971] and HR = 1.33 [p = 0.638]). Sequencing data revealed that mutational burden was not associated with veliparib benefit. The rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was higher in recent smokers with veliparib treatment; all-grade and serious adverse events were similar in both treatment arms.
3:::The synthetic procedures yielded the desired drug conjugates with full supporting characterisation. Drug regeneration through photolysis of the synthesised conjugates was successful in both acetonitrile solution and within the pMEA scaffold upon UV irradiation. Conjugates were retained within the pMEA scaffold with exclusive drug liberation following irradiation and increased drug dose with increasing exposure. Multi-dosing capacity was demonstrated though the ability of successive irradiation periods to generate further bursts of drug.
3:::Exposing hMVEC to 50 and 95% O2 for more than 24 h impaired cell viability and proliferation. Hyperoxia did not significantly affect nitrotyrosine levels, nor eNOS mRNA and protein levels, regardless of the exposure time or oxygen concentration used. Phosphorylation of eNOS at the serine 1177 (S1177) residue and ET-1 mRNA levels were also not significantly affected.
3:::Mean age at presentation was 32 years, with a 3:2 male-to-female distribution. Family history was positive in all patients. Nine eyes had pseudopodia lentis, whereas all 10 had glass wool-like vitreous. Glaucoma developed in 1 patient (2 eyes). Waxy paper-like vitreous with firm vitreous adhesions beyond major arcades and along retinal vessels was noted during surgery in all eyes. Congo red staining and apple green birefringence demonstrated vitreous amyloidosis. The mean preoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.39±0.64 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), whereas the postoperative BCVA improved to 0.17±0.07 logMAR (P = 0.004). Gene sequencing revealed a phenylalanine→isoleucine mutation in the 33rd position of exon 2 of TTR in 1 patient of 1 pedigree, confirming the diagnosis of FAP. Two patients subsequently were found to have sensorimotor autonomic neuropathy, whereas 2 others had subclinical autonomic dysfunction.
3:::A consecutive series of 32 patients was treated between July 2010 and June 2016. Mean follow-up after surgery was 29 months (median 24, range 4-78). Mean presurgical tumor volume was 12.5 cm(3) (range 1.47-34.9). Postoperative status showed normal facial nerve function (House-Brackmann I) in all patients. In a subgroup of 17 patients with serviceable hearing before surgery and in which cochlear nerve preservation was attempted at surgery, 16 (94.1%) retained serviceable hearing. Among them, 13 had normal hearing (Gardner-Robertson class 1) before surgery, and 10 (76.9%) retained normal hearing after surgery. Mean duration between surgery and GKRS was 6.3 months (range 3.8-13.9). Mean tumor volume at GKRS was 3.5 cm(3) (range 0.5-12.8), corresponding to mean residual volume of 29.4% (range 6-46.7) of the preoperative volume. Mean marginal dose was 12 Gy (range 11-12). Mean follow-up after GKRS was 24 months (range 3-60). Following GKRS, there were no new neurological deficits, with facial and hearing functions remaining identical to those after surgery in all patients. Three patients presented with continuous growth after GKRS, were considered failures, and benefited from the same combined approach a second time.
3:::The vancomycin trough concentration varied significantly among ICU patients on a fixed dose of 2g/day. Only 16.9% of ICU patients met the concentration target of 15-20mg/l, while 25% of patients showed supratherapeutic concentrations. A higher proportion of female patients than male patients showed supratherapeutic concentrations (40.4% vs. 15.5%). The trough concentration was positively correlated with age (y=0.279x-2.085; R(2)=0.186) and negatively correlated with eGFR (y=-0.2x+33.776; R(2)=0.366). Vancomycin-related nephrotoxicity occurred at an incidence of 5.9%.
3:::Post-biopsy hematoma rate was 0.8% (43/5121) for ultrasound guided-fine needle aspiration and 4.9% (9/183) for ultrasound guided-core needle biopsy (P < 0.001). For ultrasound guided-fine needle aspiration, gender, age, size, presence of vascularity, and suspicious US features were not associated with post-biopsy hematoma according to experience level. Post-biopsy hematoma occurred significantly more with ultrasound guided-core needle biopsy (9/179, 5.0%) than with ultrasound guided-fine needle aspiration (9/1138, 0.8%) (P < 0.001) in experienced performers and ultrasound guided-core needle biopsy was the only significant risk factor for post-biopsy hematoma (adjusted Odds Ratio, 6.458, P < 0.001).
3:::In 9 cadavers, changes (mean±SD) in the AP distance (cm) during the applied forces were 2.1±1.2 for a compression force of 30kg, 2.9±1.3 for 40kg, 4.3±1.0 for 50kg, 1.0±0.8 for a decompression force of -10kg and 1.8±0.6 for -15kg. After 5min of automated CPR, AP excursion distances were significantly greater (p<0.05). AP distance increased to 3.7±1.4 for a compression force of 30kg, 4.9±1.6 for 40kg, 6.3±1.9 for 50kg, 2.3±0.9 for -10kg of lift and 2.7±1.1 for -15kg of lift.
3:::Seven variants were detected in TSHR-p.P52T, p.G132R, p.M164K, p.R450H, p.C700E, p.A522V, and p.R528S. The p. G132R, p. M164K and p. R528S variants were first identified in public databases. Five variants (p.G44D, p.G360V, p.R401Q, p.L418I, and p.E453Q) were found in NKX2.1 and one variant (p.P243T) was detected in FOXE1. In addition, one variant (p.N291I) was found in NKX2.5 and two variants (p.A355V and c.-26G>A) were detected in PAX8.
3:::We identified 34 adolescent patients (38 hips) with an average age of 16 years (range, 13-17 years). The mean clinical follow-up period was 36.1 ± 11.6 months (range, 24.1-71.7 months) and 29.6 ± 2.4 months (range, 27.9-31.3 months) without and with reoperation, respectively. A control group of 296 non-adolescent patients (306 hips), with a mean age of 31 years (range, 18-59 years), was identified as our non-adolescent group. The mean clinical follow-up period was 34.1 ± 11 months (range, 24.0-77.4 months) and 15.1 ± 9.1 months (range, 3.6-34.6 months) without and with reoperation, respectively. Significant improvement was noted in adolescents in the changes in outcome scores (mHHS, 22.2 [95% confidence interval (CI), 15.4-29.0]; HOS-ADL, 18.6 [95% CI, 11.9-25.2]; HOS-SSS, 33.5 [95% CI, 24.5-42.5]; and iHOT-33 score, 30.5 [95% CI, 21.8-39.2]; P < .001). Similar improvements were observed in non-adolescents (mHHS, 21.0 [95% CI, 19.0-23.0]; HOS-ADL, 16.6 [95% CI, 14.6-18.6]; HOS-SSS, 30.1 [95% CI, 26.6-33.6]; and iHOT-33 score, 34.9 [95% CI, 31.5-38.3]; P < .001). There was no evidence of a difference in follow-up survey scores between groups (P > .203). Revision surgery was required in 2 adolescent hips (5.3% [95% CI, 1.5%-17.3%]) and 19 non-adolescent hips (6.2% [95% CI, 4.0%-9.5%]). Minimum 2-year radiographs were available for review in 24 adolescent patients (30 hips). The alpha angle (mean ± standard deviation) was reduced from 55.4° ± 12.1° preoperatively to 38.7° ± 4.9° at 6 weeks postoperatively (mean difference, -16.4° [95% CI, -19.8° to -12.9°]; P < .001). At 2 years, the alpha angle remained at 39.2° ± 11.2°, which did not differ from 6-week measurements (mean difference, 0.5° [95% CI, -2.9° to 3.9°]; P = .784). There were no cases of cam recurrence (0% [95% CI, 0%-11.4%]).
3:::Eight studies (n = 448) were included. Although memantine add-on treatment was superior to placebo for ameliorating negative symptoms (SMD = -0.96, p = 0.006, I (2) = 88%; N = 7, n = 367) in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale general subscale (MD = -1.62, p = 0.002, I (2) = 0%; N = 4, n = 151) and Mini-Mental Status Examination score (MD = -3.07, p < 0.0001, I (2) = 21%; N = 3, n = 83), there were no statistically significant differences in the amelioration of overall (SMD = -0.75, p = 0.06, I (2)  = 86%; N = 5, n = 271), positive (SMD = -0.46, p = 0.07, I (2) = 80%; N = 7, n = 367), and depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.127, p = 0.326, I (2) = 0%; N = 4, n = 201); all-cause discontinuation (RR = 1.34, p = 0.31, I (2) = 0%; N = 8, n = 448); and individual adverse events (fatigue, dizziness, headache, nausea, constipation) between the groups. For negative symptoms, the significant heterogeneity disappeared when risperidone studies alone were considered (I (2) = 0%). However, memantine add-on treatment remained superior to placebo (SMD = -1.29, p = 0.00001). Meta-regression analysis showed that patient age was associated with memantine-associated amelioration of negative symptoms (slope = 0.171, p = 0.0206).
3:::Over the median follow-up period of 5.3 years, 873 metabolically healthy non-overweight, 512 metabolically healthy overweight and 536 metabolically healthy obesity individuals progressed to metabolically abnormal. The adjusted hazard risks of fatty liver on progression were 1.49 (95% confidence interval 1.20-1.83, p = 0.005) in metabolically healthy non-overweight, 1.37 (1.12-1.66, p = 0.002) in metabolically healthy overweight and 1.38 (1.15-1.66, p < 0.001) in metabolically healthy obesity, after adjusting for age, sex, alcohol, smoking, exercise, impaired fasting glucose, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration, and abdominal obesity.
3:::Vasovagal incidences during the administration of spinal anesthesia were seen to increase in cases of high anxiety score, male gender, and an absence of anesthesia history. Educational level and the number of spinal needle punctures were not found to have any effect on vasovagal incidents.
3:::We designed, manufactured, and validated an optimised TMS coil and applied it to brain stimulation. Our simulations indicate that this coil requires less than half the power of a commercial figure-of-eight coil, with a 41% reduction due to the optimised winding geometry and a partial contribution due to our thinner coil former and reduced conductor height. With the optimised coil, the resting motor threshold of abductor pollicis brevis was reached with the capacitor voltage below 600 V and peak current below 3000 A.
3:::The mean patient age was 61.32±18.68years, 45,7% were female (n=42), 54.3% male (n=50). Their APACHE values varied between 3 and 39 with an average of 13.27±7.86 and 75% of the cases were under mechanical ventilation. When classified by using RSS (2.70±1.28), 10.9% were anxious or agitated (RSS1), 68.5% were calm (RSS 2-3), and 20.6% were sedated (RSS 4-6). When classified by using RASS (-0.64±1.58), 20.7% were anxious or agitated (RASS+1 to +4), 63.0% were calm (RASS 0 to -2), and 16.3% were sedated (RASS -3 to -5). When classified by using RSAS (2.63±1.00), 12% were anxious or agitated (RSAS 5-7), 57.6% were calm (RSAS 4), and 30.4% were sedated (RSAS 1-3). RSS was correlated with the RSAS (r=-0.656, p<0.001) and RASS was correlated with the RSAS (r=0.565, p<0.001). RSS was highly correlated with the RASS (r=-0.664, p<0.001).
3:::The results showed that (1) the pia and arachnoid maters merged within the optic canal, (2) a dense trabecular mesh network was distributed in the orbital part of the canal, and (3) some optic nerve sheath (ONS) fibers intermingled with the tendinous fibers of the extraocular muscles and attached to the periosteum of the sphenoid bone, rather than entirely continuing with the inner layer of the dura mater.
3:::During follow-up, 1,134 colorectal cancers developed (737 colon, 397 rectal). We found no association between residential road traffic noise and rectal cancer. We observed an association with distal colon cancer: HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.40, but not for proximal colon cancer: 0.99 (0.83-1.18), per 10 dB, 10 years preceding diagnosis. There was no association between railway noise and colorectal cancer, or any subtype.
3:::Patient characteristics were similar in both groups. As for surgical outcomes, estimated intraoperative blood loss (P = 0.90), operative time (P = 0.48), preoperative hemoglobin (P = 0.09), postoperative hemoglobin (P = 0.42), and operative complications (P = 1.0) did not differ between the two groups. The hospital costs (converted from Egyptian pound to U.S. dollars) were significantly higher in case of LAVH group [VH: $1060.86 ($180.09) versus LAVH: $1560.5 ($220.57), P value <0.001]. No significant difference exists in the duration of postoperative hospital stay between the two groups [VH: 49.92 h (28.50) versus LAVH: 58.56 (27.78), P = 0.28] or the actual uterine weight measured postoperatively [VH: 350.72 g (71.78) versus LAVH: 385.96 g (172.52), P = 0.35].
3:::We found consistency between experimental and simulated magnetic flux and current density distributions using transtemporal (T7-T8) and anterior-posterior (Fpz-Oz) electrode montages, and also differences that may indicate a need to improve models to better interpret experimental results. While human subject data agreed with computational model predictions in overall scale, differences may result from factors such as effective electrode surface area and conductivities assumed in models.
3:::Sixty-four randomized clinical trials including 15 different therapies were included in a total of 15,731 patients infected with the hepatitis C virus, mostly with genotype 1, and mainly treated for 12 or 24 weeks. The sustained virologic response rate after 12 weeks of treatment was approximately 89%, while the virologic failure rate was below 5%.
3:::The mean age of patients was 59.6±12.3years, the sex ratio for male of 1.9. Stroke was ischemic in 66% of cases. Hypertension was the most frequent cardiovascular risk factor (84.3%), followed by high blood cholesterol (45.2%).The etiologies of ischemic stroke (TOAST classification) were dominated by lacunas (38.5%) and embolic heart diseases (12.8%). The origin was unknown in 45.9% of cases. Coma was observed in 37% of patients on admission and was the main independent prognostic factor of mortality, which was 19.3%. Left ventricular hypertrophy and renal failure were found respectively in 64.7% and 34% of patients.
3:::Twenty of 793 (2.52%) VPA-treated patients had signs and symptoms consistent with VHE. The majority were White males on multiple psychotropic agents. Valproate was appropriately discontinued in 8 (40%) patients. Lactulose was the only ammonia-lowering drug used, and it was administered to 6 patients and only one among them had VPA discontinued.
3:::Sixteen weeks supplementation with vitamin D increased median of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] and mean calcium levels (p < 0.001) in the intervention group. There was also a significant difference in parathyroid hormone level at the end of the study (p < 0.001). Vitamin D treatment reduced IL-6 level after 16 weeks (p = 0.027). Compared to baseline, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin levels decreased significantly in vitamin D treated subjects; however, there were no significant differences between two groups. No effect of vitamin D supplementation was observed in either common carotid intima media thickness or high sensitivity C-reactive protein concentrations at the end of the study (p > 0.05).
3:::All parameters showed significant reduction (p < 0.05). Pepsinogen I reduction correlated with BMI percent decrease.
3:::Our results demonstrated a significantly enhanced SVF cell yield isolated from lipedema compared with healthy patients. In contrast, the adipogenic differentiation potential of SVF cells isolated from lipedema patients was significantly reduced compared with healthy patients. Interestingly, expression of the mesenchymal marker CD90 and the endothelial/pericytic marker CD146 was significantly enhanced when isolated from lipedema patients.
3:::In 453 RTRs (age 51 ± 12 years, 56% male; 6.1 [2.7-11.7] years after transplantation), serum PCSK9 was 107.1 ± 43.4 μg/L. During a median follow-up of 10 years, 70 RTRs developed NODAT, 123 died, and 59 developed graft failure. NODAT occurred more frequently in the upper PCSK9 tertile (23%) versus the lowest two PCSK9 tertiles (12%; P < 0.001). In crude Cox regression analyses, PCSK9 was significantly associated with development of NODAT (hazard ratio 1.34 [95% CI 1.10-1.63]) per SD change (P = 0.004). This association remained independent of adjustment for potential confounders, including statin use. PCSK9 was not associated with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or graft failure.
3:::At a mean follow-up of 32 months, all 3 patients were pain free and had maintained a stable joint, with a functional range of motion. Each patient gave a rating of either ""Greatly Improved"" or ""Almost Normal"" on the Summary Outcome Determination scale. Radiographs performed during the last follow-up showed improved radiocapitellar alignment.
3:::Overall, ten eligible studies involving a total of 1894 cases and 1746 controls were included in our meta-analysis. The results showed that there was no statistical evidence of association between NADPH oxidase p22phox C242T polymorphism and DN in all genetic models (T vs. C: OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.85-1.59, p=0.34; TT vs. CC: OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.80-2.76, p=0.21; TT/CT vs. CC: OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.81-1.72, p=0.40; TT vs.
3:::Overall, 13 retrospective cohort studies were included. Of these, 13 reported the association between M3s and mandibular angle fracture, and 5 reported the association with mandibular condylar fracture. Patients with M3s had an increased risk of mandibular angle fractures (RR = 2.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.15-3.21) but a decreased risk of mandibular condylar fractures (RR = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.25-0.86). Substantial heterogeneity in the risk estimates was found. No evidence of publication bias was found.
3:::We identified a total of 214,457 admissions for AF. Patients with T2DM accounted for 21.1% (19,505 men and 25,954 women). Women with T2DM had a significantly higher incidence of AF compared to men over the study period (IRR 1.33;95%CI 1.31-1.35). Women were significantly older (77.24±8.69years) than men (72.62±10.28years), had higher prevalences of obesity and hypertension, and higher CHA2DS2-VASc score. Women less frequently underwent ablation (3.21% vs. 1.54%; p<0.001) and received an implanted pacemaker (14.3% vs. 8.16%; p<0.001) than men. Crude IHM was 2.81% for women and 2.48% for men (p=0.030). Sex was not associated with a higher IHM after multivariable adjustment.
3:::Both motor types and instrument types produced significantly different ranges of average vibrations. Regardless of the instrument types, the WOM group generated greater vibration than the XSM group (P < .05). Although PTN and PTU did not show significant differences, the WOP group showed significantly greater vibration than the other groups regardless of motor types (P < .05).
3:::Using ICaST in conjunction with an improved G-CaMP7, we successfully achieved long-term tracking and Ca(2+) imaging of the AVA backward command interneurons while tracking the head of a moving animal. We also performed all-optical manipulation and simultaneous recording of Ca(2+) dynamics from GABAergic motor neurons in conjunction with behavior monitoring.
3:::Step-ladder (P < .001) and spider-web patterns (P < .001) in trabecular bone of the jaw were more common in individuals with SCA than in the control group. Loss of lamina dura was more frequent in those with SCA than in control individuals (P = .021). Dental changes were not different between groups (P > .05), even though the prevalence of hypotaurodontism was twice as high in the SCA group as in controls (P = .086).
3:::The wild growing or cutting wood culture fruiting bodies, and the dish cultures of AC showed more potent activities than the mycelia (P<0.001). At 20μM, 16 of 29 triterpenoids showed significant protective activities, increasing HepG2 cell viability from 46% of the CCl4 group to >90%. Antcin B and antcin K could dose-dependently (10 or 50mg/kg, 7 days, i.g.) decrease the serum levels of ALT and AST, and decrease the incidence of liver necrosis. The effects of 50mg/kg of antcin K or antcin B were almost identical to those of 100mg/kg silymarin. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and Western blotting analyses revealed they could down-regulate IL-1β, TNF-α, iNOS, COX-2 and NF-κB in liver tissues at both transcriptional and translational levels.
3:::Average survival rate of transplanted premolars (n = 26) was 100% over a follow-up period of 29 months (range 10-60 months). The relative soft tissue level significantly increased by +1.1 mm (P < .01). Radiographs showed a tendency toward vertical bone growth. Continuous root development and signs of pulpal healing were observed postoperatively in 18 transplants (69.2%).
3:::The isolated compounds were identified as precatorin A (1), precatorin B (2), precatorin C (3), lupinifolin (4), cajanone (5) and lupinifolinol (6). Compounds 1-3 are new. Compounds 1 to 5 inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis (MIC ≥31.25µg/mL); compounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 killed the bacteria (MBC ≥31.25µg/mL) and also inhibited M. smegmatis (MIC ≥125µg/mL), while 1 and 4 also resulted bactericidal (MBC ≥125µg/mL). Compounds 4 and 5 presented synergistic effect (X/Y quotient value <0.5) at a concentration of 1/2 MIC of each compound in the combination. Cytotoxicity in murine macrophages (RAW 264.7 cells) gave IC50 values of 13.3-46.98µM, for compounds 1-5.
3:::The antisynthetase antibodies we investigated were anti-Jo1 (n = 62), anti-PL7 (n = 31), anti-PL12 (n = 12), and anti-EJ (n = 19). The overall prevalence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) reached 94.4% among study patients. Eleven patients (8.9%) developed rapidly progressive ILD (RP-ILD). Eight patients (6.5%) experienced malignancy. RP-ILD was statistically more prevalent in patients with antisynthetase syndrome with anti-PL7 than those without anti-PL7 (p = 0.028). Anti-Ro52-positive patients with antisynthetase syndrome experienced higher frequency of RP-ILD than those without anti-Ro52 (p = 0.001). Further, anti-PL7-positive patients coexisting with anti-Ro52 exhibited more RP-ILD than those without anti-Ro52 (p = 0.001). Patients with antisynthetase syndrome with RP-ILD had a higher proportion of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and serum ferritin than those without RP-ILD (p = 0.006 and p = 0.013, respectively). Although no differences were observed between the Kaplan-Meier curves of the 4 antisynthetase antibodies subgroups (p = 0.349), the survival rate of patients with anti-PL7 decreased more rapidly in the early stage of longterm followup compared with those with other antisynthetase antibodies. The presence of RP-ILD, malignancy, and elevated serum ferritin was identified to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with antisynthetase syndrome.
3:::Twenty-three species, mostly mammals, were recorded to be used for traditional medicine. The most common were Chinese serow Capricornis milneedwardsii, Asian elephant Elephas maximus, and Asiatic black bear Ursus thibetanus. Over 600 bodies or body parts were present. Combined, these parts purportedly provided cures or relief for at least 15 ailments or diseases. The most commonly mentioned treatment was that of using rendered animal fats/oils externally to relieve/cure aching joints or muscles. This treatment allegedly provides instant relief to pilgrims after an arduous climb up the mountain. Purported cures for various skin diseases was the next common use for the animal species on offer. Ten of the species observed for sale at Kyaiktiyo are listed as globally threatened, and 15 are protected and cannot be legally traded. Ambiguities in Myanmars legislation mean that protected animals or their body parts cannot be traded, however traditional medicines can be made out of them provided rules relating to the manufacturing of traditional medicines are adhered to.'
3:::During a mean follow-up of 451 ± 185 days, the incidence of AF was 22.4% (95% confidence interval 17.2%-27.7%) with a mean time to detection of 141.3 ± 139.5 days. Among subjects newly diagnosed with AF, 76.4% were prescribed anticoagulation with either a novel OAC (n = 38) or warfarin (n = 4).
3:::Over an average of 11.8 years of followup, 1505 total hip arthroplasties for OA were identified (524 in men, 981 in women). In men, a 1 SD increase in dairy product consumption was associated with a 21% increased incidence of total hip arthroplasty for OA (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10-1.33), with a dose-response relationship observed for quartiles of dairy product consumption (p for trend = 0.001). These results were independent of age, body mass index, country of birth, education, smoking status, vigorous physical activity, calcium supplementation, energy consumption, circulating 25-hydroxy vitamin D, hypertension, and diabetes. No significant association was observed for women (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95-1.09).
3:::Hemangiomas in Group A were most frequently diagnosed as malignant tumors (43.5%) due to the absence of typical imaging findings and with highest incidence of positive HBV (15.7%). Diagnostic accuracy was 98.4% in Groups B to D. Liver failure after hepatectomy was higher in Group D than in Groups A to C (3.0% vs. 0.5%, P = 0.02). Only one operative death was observed (0.2%) in Group D.
3:::Seventeen studies were included: 5 cross-sectional, 10 cohort studies measuring outcomes at 2 timepoints, and 2 longitudinal studies assessing outcome only at the timepoint. Eleven studies were of high or moderate quality. In asymptomatic middle-aged adults, elevated body weight and BMI were systematically associated with worse patellofemoral cartilage scores. There was more consistent evidence for patellar cartilage defects than patellar cartilage volume, particularly in women. Increased BMI was also consistently associated with increased cartilage loss in longitudinal studies, although not all attained statistical significance.
3:::A total of 11 RCTs and 21 non-randomised control trials (2520 patients) were included. For patients without the presence of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), the overall survival rates between the HIPEC and control groups at 3 or 5 years resulted in favour of the HIPEC group (risk ratio [RR] = 0.82, P = 0.01). No difference in the 3-year overall survival (RR = 0.99, P = 0.85) in but a prolonged median survival of 4 months in favour of the HIPEC group (WMD = 4.04, P < 0.001) was seen in patients with PC. HIPEC was associated with significantly higher risk of complications for both patients with PC (RR = 2.15, P < 0.01) and without (RR = 2.17, P < 0.01). This increased risk in the HIPEC group was related to systemic drugs toxicity. Anastomotic leakage rates were found to be similar between groups.
3:::Sixty-three (13%) patients had a psychiatric diagnosis, with the most common being depression (52%). Forty-percent (n=25/63) of these patients had multiple pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses. Patients with a psychiatric diagnosis had a greater total-body-surface-area (TBSA)% covered by a third-degree burn (p=0.001), and were more likely to have an inhalation injury (p<0.001). These patients were also significantly more likely to experience 6 of the 10 most prevalent in-hospital complications and had a higher mortality rate (p=0.02). They were less likely to be discharged home (p=0.001), and more likely to go to a home hospital (p=0.04) or rehabilitation facility (p=0.03). Psychiatric diagnosis was associated with significantly more placement issues (e.g. rehab bed unavailability, homeless) upon discharge from the Burn Unit (p=0.01). The risk of death in burn patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders was about three times the risk of death in patients with no psychiatric disorders when adjusting for other potential confounders (95% CI, 1.13-9.10; p-value 0.03).
3:::Among all patients, male sex (OR = 4.85, p<0.001) and diabetes (OR = 2.36, p<0.001) were the most important risk factors of CAC extent, with age, hypertension, dyslipidemia and smoking also showing a relationship. Among patients with CAC, age, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia were associated with an increasing CAC score in males and females, with diabetes being the strongest dichotomous risk factor (p<0.001 for both). These results were echoed in quantile regression, where diabetes was consistently the most important correlate with CAC extent in every quantile in both males and females. To a lesser extent, hypertension and dyslipidemia were also associated in the high CAC quantiles and the low CAC quantiles respectively.
3:::Among the 75 patients without classic TAB features of GCA, 8 had GCA diagnoses. The PPV of ILA, VVV, and SVV seen by either or both pathologists were 17%, 0%, and 7%, and 17%, 0%, and 10%, respectively.
3:::In 15 patients pathologic staging of primary tumor differed from expected staging assessed according to preoperative MRI. In 5 patients pathologic complete remission was achieved. In none of these 5 patients pCR was predicted using preoperative MRI. Sensitivity and specificity of MRI in predicting pCR were 0% and 96%. Accuracy of MRI in predicting pT and pN was 79% and 74%.
3:::Based on the performed statistical analysis (t-test) with 95% confidence level (t-value >1.96), there was a meaningful difference between the results of film dosimetry and treatment planning at all of the points understudy.
3:::A total of 13 tumours showed exponential growth, 10 linear growth and 16 logistic growth after surgery. The remaining 13 did not show regrowth of tumour. Seven of the exponential growing tumours underwent secondary surgery, compared to one and two of linear and logistic growing tumours (p = 0.03), respectively. Initial tumour volume doubling time was significantly lower in logistic growing tumours than in exponential growing tumours (p < 0.01). Men had tumours with lower tumour volume doubling time than women (p = 0.03). None of the tumours demonstrated signs of accelerated growth.
3:::During treatment with TNF inhibitors, there were 17 patients with new onset of severe ExRA in 2400 person-years at risk (PY; 0.71/100 PY, 95% CI 0.41-1.13) compared with 104 in 15,599 PY (0.67/100 PY, 95% CI 0.54-0.81) in patients without TNF inhibitors. This corresponded to an incidence rate ratio of 1.06 (95% CI 0.60-1.78). The age- and sex-adjusted HR for ExRA in anti-TNF-treated patients was 1.21 (95% CI 1.02-1.43), with similar findings in models adjusted for time-dependent Health Assessment Questionnaire and propensity for anti-TNF treatment. Male sex, positive rheumatoid factor (RF), long disease duration, and greater disability were predictors for ExRA.
3:::Cardiac inflammation and fibrosis scores and; TGF-β expression were not significantly different within study groups at 6th hour and 21st days of RT. By 100th days of RT fibrosis scores and TGF-β expression in cardiac samples were significantly different between study groups (p values were 0.004 and 0.002 respectively). Pair-wise comparisons revealed that both cardiac fibrosis scores and TGF-β expression levels were higher in G5 when compared to G8 (p values were 0.046 and 0.028 respectively). Moreover the TGF-β expression was higher in G5 when compared to G2 (p = 0.046). We could not demonstrate any significant differences with respect to inflammation, fibrosis and TGF-β expression in thoracic aorta samples between study groups.
3:::In 131 patients without renal insufficiency, LBM was correlated with creatinine (r = 0.30, p < 0.005) but not with cystatin C (r = -0.07, p = 0.43). In patients with the lowest LBM percentage, the CrCl was significantly higher than GFRcysC-creat indicating an overestimation of GFR with creatinine (p = 0.0004). In 24 patients treated with carboplatin AUC 5 (mg/ml min) ± paclitaxel, the risk of severe thrombocytopenia was associated with lower LBM percentage (p = 0.0002) and higher CrCl/GFRcysC-creat ratio (p = 0.006). By ROC analysis, the CrCl/GFRcysC-creat ratio threshold predicting severe thrombocytopenia was 1.23.
3:::Nineteen patients (13 with AML, 5 with ALL, 1 with MDS) were treated. The most common grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicities attributable to plerixafor were febrile neutropenia and hypokalemia. There were no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Plerixafor exposure increased with increasing dose levels and clearance was similar on days 1 and 5. Eighteen patients were evaluable for response. Two patients achieved complete remission (CR) and one patient achieved CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi): all three had AML. No responses were seen in patients with ALL or MDS. Plerixafor mobilized leukemic blasts into the peripheral blood in 14 of 16 evaluable patients (median 3.4-fold increase), and the degree of mobilization correlated with surface CXCR4 expression.
3:::Electromyography (EMG) recordings showed a complex electrophysiological pattern with brief bursts of less than 100 ms and longer bursts with a duration of 100-300 ms up to several seconds in keeping with myoclonus and chorea, respectively, as key findings. None of the patients had EMG patterns of myokymia.
3:::A total of 126 patients, of whom 72 were known to have underlying inflammatory bowel disease, were included in the final analysis. Among the patients with elevated fecal calprotectin levels and known inflammatory bowel disease, 66% (33/50) went on to have escalation of therapy within 12 months compared to 18% (4/22) if the fecal calprotectin levels were in the normal range (p < .0001). For the remaining patients who at baseline did not have inflammatory bowel disease and a normal endoscopic evaluation, elevated fecal calprotectin resulted in no cases (0/17) of a new diagnosis in the next 12 months.
3:::AA-induced bladder overactivity significantly reduced bladder capacity (BC) to 16.3 ± 2.2% of the NS control level (389.4 ± 27.68 ml; P < 0.01). When given a single stimulation, both SNS and TNS significantly increased the BC to 39.2 ± 1.6% and 34.9 ± 5.0% of the NS control level (P < 0.01), respectively. Combined SNS and TNS significantly increased the BC to 50.2 ± 5.2% of the NS control level (P < 0.01) and induced a superior inhibitory effect than SNS or TNS alone (P < 0.05).
3:::The first phase of search returned 303 articles. A total of 19 papers with full text were scrutinized for inclusion, of which 3 papers were chosen for the final synthesis. All three studies confirm that BAG treatment leads to enhanced apatite formation in dentin. Only 1 of the 3 studies has reported the mechanical properties of dentin after BAG treatment and it revealed that the Youngs modulus and flexural bend strength of BAG treated dentin were much lower than natural dentin even though they had similar apatite content.'
3:::During the study period, 197 surveys were returned; 84 at baseline, 53 at 3-months post education, and 60 at the final assessment period 18-months post intervention. The significant improvements in mean knowledge scores at 3-months post intervention (7.2, SD 1.3) were not maintained at 18-months (5.3, SD 1.1). Screening tool perception scores remained unchanged. Improvements in the perception of utility were significant at both time periods (p=0.03, 0.02 respectively). Physician value significantly improved at 18-months (p=0.01). Delirium screening frequency improved after education (p<0.001) demonstrating a positive correlation over time (p<0.01).
3:::Research needs identified included expanded uses of clinical data and specimens in predicting or assessing resilience, and contributions from epidemiological studies in identifying long-term predictors. Better measures, including simulation tests, are needed to assess resilience and its determinants. Mechanistic studies should include exploration of influences of biologic aging processes on human resiliencies. Important resource and infrastructure needs include consensus phenotype definitions of specific resiliencies, capacity to link epidemiological and clinical resilience data, sensor technology to capture responses to stressors, better laboratory animal models of human resiliencies, and new analytic methods to understand the effects of multiple determinants of stress responses.
3:::Mothers marital status history was summarized into six clusters: stable marriage, stable cohabitation, married then divorcing, cohabiting then separating, varied transitions, and not with father. In fully adjusted models and compared with women whose mothers belonged to the stable marriage cluster: (1) women whose mothers belonged to the other marital status clusters had higher odds of overweight/obesity (odds ratio (OR) ranging 1.15-1.19; p < 0.05); and (2) women whose mothers belonged to the stable cohabitation (OR = 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14-1.52), cohabiting then separating (OR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.01-1.49), varied transitions (OR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.11-1.39), and not with father (OR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.00-1.54) clusters had higher odds of obesity.'
3:::The accuracy of CE and EUS to estimate the invasion depth of EGCs was 78.8% (215/273) and 83.9% (229/273) (p = .124), respectively. Using multivariate analysis, irregular depressed surface (odds ratio [OR] 8.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.79-23.53), fold change (OR 7.22; 95% CI: 2.33-22.38), size >2 cm (OR 2.72; 95% CI: 1.15-6.42) and ulcer scar (OR 2.64; 95% CI: 1.07-6.49) were associated with the higher accuracy of EUS than that of CE.
3:::Serum levels of brain damage marker S100B recovered faster in the RIPC group, after 4 hours of the arrest, (p < .05). Systemic lactate levels were lower and cardiac index was higher in the RIPC group postoperatively. Immunohistochemical cerebellum regional scores of antioxidant response regulator Nrf2 were better in the RIPC group (mean: 1.1, IQR: 0.0-2.5) compared with the control group (mean: 0.0, IQR: 0.0-0.0), reaching borderline statistical significance (p = .064). RIPC induced detectable modulations of plasma proteome and metabolites.
3:::Of 36 patients, M:F was 23:13. Indications for laparotomy were pneumoperitoneum (30) and gangrene (6). Postoperatively, 9/15 (60.0%) of EC group required ventilator support versus none in LC group (p < 0.05). It took longer to establish full feeds following EC (12 days) versus LC (8 days). Median duration of postoperative hospital stay following EC was 31 days (18-35) versus 7 days (4-54) following LC. Three patients were re-operated for intestinal obstruction (two following EC, one following LC). Three patients developed incisional hernia after EC versus none after LC (p < 0.05). One patient died after EC due to staphylococcus septicaemia.
3:::ENT knowledge was generally thought to be poor amongst doctors, and it was recommended that undergraduate ENT topics be kept simple. The highest rated topics were: clinical examination; when to refer; acute otitis media; common emergencies; tonsillitis and quinsy; management of ENT problems by non-ENT doctors; stridor and stertor; otitis externa; and otitis media with effusion.
3:::We confirmed the transient expression and purification of a truncated version of the HEV genotype 3 capsid protein in Nicotiana benthamiana and its usefulness as a diagnostic antigen. ELISA showed the presence of anti-HEV IgG antibodies in 29 of the 36 human samples. The in-house ELISA showed anti-HEV IgG antibodies in 34 of the 45 pigs.
3:::Overall, 12.3% of the survey respondents had DM, 15.5% had 6 or more teeth extracted, and 22.6% reported that they consumed 1 or more SSB daily. In the adjusted analyses, among adults who had DM, those who consumed at least 2 SSBs daily were more likely to have had 6 or more teeth extracted than those who reported that they did not consume SSBs (adjusted odds ratio, 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.37 to 4.01; P = .0018). Among adults who did not have DM, those who consumed more than 1 but fewer than 2 SSBs per day were more likely to have had at least 6 teeth extracted (adjusted odds ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 1.77; P < .0001).
3:::ASES score increased from a median of 38.2 ± 6.2 preoperative to 92.1 ± 4.7 postoperatively (p ≤ 0.05). The median VAS score improved from 62 mm (range 45-100 mm) preoperatively to 8 mm (range 0-20 mm) at final follow-up (p ≤ 0.05). No patient experienced pain or discomfort with either direct palpation of the AC joint or with cross-body adduction. Final radiographs demonstrated symmetric AC joint contour in 25/32 (78%) patients. Seven patients (22%) radiographically demonstrated superior translation of the distal clavicle relative to the superior margin of the acromion but less than 50% of the clavicular width. 30/32 patients (93%) were able to return to their pre-injury level of work and sports activities.
3:::Tranexamic acid rapidly and reversibly inhibited NMDA receptors (half maximal inhibitory concentration = 241 ± 45 mM, mean ± SD; 95% CI, 200 to 281; n = 5) and shifted the glycine concentration-response curve for NMDA-evoked current to the right. Tranexamic acid also inhibited α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (half maximal inhibitory concentration = 231 ± 91 mM; 95% CI, 148 to 314; n = 5 to 6) and kainate receptors (half maximal inhibitory concentration = 90 ± 24 mM; 95% CI, 68 to 112; n = 5).
3:::The mean decrease in total corneal fluorescein staining at 12 weeks after treatment was higher in the 0.5% R348 group (-6.0 ± 3.9, NEI scoring) compared with the vehicle (-2.1 ± 2.6, P = 0.045) or the 0.2% R348 group (-4.1 ± 3.6, P = 0.34). However, there were no significant differences among the groups in terms of treatment-induced changes in OSDI, Ocular Comfort Index, conjunctival lissamine green staining, or Schirmer scores. R348 eye drops were well tolerated.
3:::Dienogest markedly inhibited interleukin 1β-stimulated C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 mRNA expression and protein secretion in EMosis-CC/TERT1/PRA-/PRB+, which was abrogated by the progesterone receptor antagonist RU486. In EMosis-CC/TERT1/PRA+, dienogest slightly inhibited C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 mRNA and protein. In EMosis-CC/TERT1, dienogest slightly inhibited C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 mRNA, but had no effect on C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 protein.
3:::The study included 127 patients. All patients completed the initial postoperative survey, and 108 reached the 6-month follow-up. The most common procedure was video-assisted thoracic lobectomy (55%). At the first postoperative visit, there was a significant increase in pain, fatigue, and sleep impairment and a decrease in physical function. By 6 months, these PRO measures had generally improved toward baseline.
3:::It was shown that at a temperature of 2500 K the vapor over the samples in the Gd2 O3 -Y2 O3 -HfO2 system consisted of the GdO, YO and O vapor species. The Gd2 O3 and Y2 O3 activities in the samples in the Gd2 O3 -Y2 O3 -HfO2 system as well as their vaporization rates were derived from the partial pressures of the vapor species. Using these data the HfO2 activities, the Gibbs energy of mixing and the excess Gibbs energy in this system were calculated at 2500 K.
3:::Twenty-three (10.6%) patients had complications related to arterial percutaneous closure-14 (60.8%) stenosis, 6 (26.1%) persistent bleeding, and 1 (4.3%) dissection. These lesions were accessible to endovascular treatment via a crossover procedure. One (4.3%) suture failure and 1 (4.3%) misplacement of the device, with a puncture site created above the femoral arch, were reported. The patient developed a retroperitoneal hematoma postoperatively and required transfusion of 2 units of red blood cells associated with a cutdown to remove hematoma and to repair the common femoral artery.
3:::S1 from all teeth were positive for bacteria. Preparation to the first and third instruments from the TFA system showed a highly significant intracanal bacterial reduction regardless of the irrigant (P < .01). Apical enlargement to the third instrument caused a significantly higher decrease in bacterial counts than the first instrument (P < .01). Intergroup comparison revealed no significant difference between NaOCl and saline after the first instrument (P > .05). NaOCl was significantly better than saline after using the largest instrument in the series (P < .01).
3:::Several gait measures were worse in older compared to younger adults under all walking conditions (p<0.005). Even at the lowest level of challenge, older adults had significant increases in HbO2 levels during usual walking, relative to standing (p=0.006). Both groups showed increased activation during dual-task (p<0.002) and during obstacle negotiation (p<0.003).
3:::The median age at transplantation (n=104) was 47 (IQR 40-59)], 37 (35.6%) patients were female, and the overall mortality was 34.6% (n=36). After a median follow-up period of 47 (IQR 25-84) months, overt hypothyroidism (basal TSH>4.49mIU/l, FT4<11.6pmol/l) was observed in 4 patients (3.8%) and subclinical hypothyroidism (basal TSH>4.49mIU/l, normal fT4) was observed in 20 patients (19.2%). Positive thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibodies were found in 5 (4.8%) patients. A total of 13 patients (12.5%) were treated with thyroid hormone replacement. Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) ≥grade 2 occurred in 55 (52.9%) and chronic GvHD (cGvHD) in 74 (71.2%) of the patients. The risk of developing hypothyroidism was higher in the patients with repeated allo-HSCTs (P=0.024) and with positive TPO antibodies (P=0.045). Furthermore, the development of overt hypothyroidism was inversely proportional to age (P=0.043). No correlation was found with GvHD, HLA-mismatch, total body irradiation, and gender.
3:::A total of 49 women with vulvar neoplasia participated in the study. Symptom prevalence decreased in women with counseling by a clinically relevant degree, but not in women with written information. Sporadically, significant differences between the 2 interventions could be observed in individual items, but not in the total scales or subscales of the symptom outcomes.
3:::Lcn2 derived from Lactis-Lcn2 inhibited the growth of E. coli and reduced the bioactivity of enterobactin (E. coli-derived siderophore) in vitro. Lactis-Lcn2 displayed enhanced tolerance to adverse pH, high concentration of bile acids, and oxidative stress in vitro and survived better in the inflamed gut than Lactis-Con. Consistent with these features, Lactis-Lcn2 displayed better mucoprotection against intestinal inflammation than Lactis-Con when administered into mice with dextran sulfate sodium-induced acute colitis.
3:::Sixty patients were included in the study. Their mean age was 66 years (range, 42-87 years); 28% of patients were >70 years. The median follow-up time was 4 years. Compliance with treatment was very high: feasibility was 55/60 (91.7%, 90% CI: 83.3%-96.7%), which satisfied the predefined criteria. The 4-year LRC was 82% (95% CI: 71-94), the FFS was 72% (95% CI: 60-85), and the OS was 77% (95% CI: 66-90). The cumulative incidences of first failure of any type at 4 years were 5.2% local, 1.8% local and distant, 8.5% regional, 1.7% regional and distant, 3.5% distant, and 7.7% death (any cause). The 4-year FFS in the patients aged ≤70 years and >70 years were 71% (95% CI: 58-88) and 73% (95% CI: 54-100), respectively (log-rank P=.801). Their 4-year OS was 79% (95% CI: 66-93) and 73% (95% CI: 53-100), respectively (log-rank P=.708). Significant late treatment toxicities were very few.
3:::In current study, all patients were followed up for 18-35 months. Sixty-six patients achieved bone union with the average radiographic and clinical healing times of 5.55±2.19 and 7.45±1.69months, respectively. Seven patients required a second debridement before grafting, while four patients experienced a recurrence of infection or a relapse following second stage treatment. Twelve patients experienced either knee or ankle dysfunctions and 2 patients faced delayed wound healing. Donor site complications includes pain and infection were found in 7 and 3 patients, respectively with delayed stress fracture in 1 patient only.
3:::A total of 13 eligible studies were found, most of them were performed in Taiwan and focused on skin and bladder cancer. The positive association between %MMA and various types of cancer was consistent, in contrast to the negative relationship between %DMA and cancer that was inconsistent. The summary risk of bladder (OR=1.79; 95% CI: 1.42, 2.26, n=4 studies) and lung (OR=2.44; 95% CI: 1.57, 3.80, n=2 studies) cancer increased significantly with increasing %MMA, without statistical heterogeneity. In contrast, lung cancer risk was inversely related to %DMA (OR=0.58; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.93, n=2 studies), also without significant heterogeneity. These results were similar after stratifying by epidemiological design and total As in urine. No evidence of publication bias was found.
3:::Five hundred seventy-four patients with high-grade, early stage salivary tumors met inclusion criteria. Sixty-seven percent of patients received radiation therapy. There was no difference in observed or relative survival based on having received radiation.
3:::Supraomohyoid neck dissection (SOHND) was the most common procedure. Neck failure developed in 4 pathologic negative (pN[-]) and 3 pathologic positive (pN[+]) patients. The site of neck recurrence was beyond the dissected field in all cases. The site of recurrence in pN(-) patients was ipsilateral in 2 patients and contralateral in 2, whereas the site in pN(+) patients was ipsilateral in 1 patient and contralateral in 2.
3:::14 patients with LASA were identified. Only 3 were free of coexisting intra- or extra-cardiac anomalies. The most common defect was tetralogy of Fallot (3 patients). One patient had five congenital defects. Kommerells diverticulum (KD) was present in 9 patients. In all patients the LASA course was retrotracheal and retroesophageal. In all but one patients esophageal modelling or compression by KD or LASA was present.'
3:::The sample included 972 subjects with a mean age of 25.81 (±2.17) years. Both BD and MDD patients showed higher prevalence of MetS compared to the population sample (BD = 46.9%, MDD = 35.1%, population = 22.1%, p < 0.001). Higher levels of glucose, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, Body Mass Index, low levels of HDL cholesterol, and a higher prevalence of abdominal obesity were observed in both BD and MDD individuals with current depressive episode compared to the general population. Moreover, there was a significant difference on BMI values in the case of BD and MDD subjects (p = 0.016).
3:::Data from 3711 adult patients with primary OCD came from Brazil (n=955), India (n=802), Italy (n=750), South Africa (n=565), Japan (n=322), Australia (n=219), and Spain (n=98). The most common current comorbid disorders were major depressive disorder (28.4%; n=1055), obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (24.5%, n=478), generalized anxiety disorder (19.3%, n=716), specific phobia (19.2%, n=714) and social phobia (18.5%, n=686). Major depression was also the most commonly co-occurring lifetime diagnosis, with a rate of 50.5% (n=1874). OCD generally had an age of onset in late adolescence (mean=17.9years, SD=1.9). Social phobia, specific phobia and body dysmorphic disorder also had an early age of onset. Co-occurring major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and psychotic disorders tended to have a later age of onset than OCD. Suicidal ideation within the last month was reported by 6.4% (n=200) of patients with OCD and 9.0% (n=314) reported a lifetime history of suicide attempt.
3:::sicG was detected in 30.9% of the isolates (16 human and one canine) and the genes from the 16 human samples (blood, 10; open pus, 3; sputum, 2; throat swab, 1) and one canine sample (open pus) showed the same sequence pattern. All sicG-harboring isolates belonged to clonal complex (CC) 17, and the most prevalent emm type was stG6792 (82.4%). There was a significant association between sicG presence and the development of skin/soft tissue infections. CC17 isolates with sicG could be divided into three subtypes by RAPD analysis.
3:::The rhein, emodin, aloe-emodin, chrysophanol were considered as pharmacokinetic markers at three doses of rhubarb anthraquinones extract. In diabetic nephropathy rats, no obvious pharmacokinetic change of the four ingredients was observed compared with control rats. However, the plasma exposures of the four ingredients increased in acute liver injury rats compared with control rats. The serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and urine protein (UP) values in diabetic nephropathy rats decreased compared with those in the model group, which suggested that rhubarb anthraquinones extract displayed certain therapeutic and preventive effects against the diabetic nephropathy. However, rhubarb anthraquinones extract cannot ameliorate the CCL4-induced liver injury under the three different dosage regimens.
3:::A total of 191 patients (96 infliximab, 95 adalimumab) were included. Differences in infliximab levels were observed for clinical (P=.081) and biochemical remission (P=.003) and faecal calprotectin normalisation (P<.0001) with corresponding thresholds identified on ROC analysis of 1.5, 3.4 and 5.7 μg/mL. Adalimumab levels were similar between active disease and remission regardless of the endpoint assessed. Modelling identified that higher infliximab dose, body mass index and colonic disease independently accounted for 31% of the variation in infliximab levels, and weekly dosing, albumin and weight accounted for 23% of variation in adalimumab levels. TGN levels did not correlate with drug levels.
3:::We found that exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to amyloid β peptides (Aβ25-35) resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability accompanied by increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, elevated levels of intracellular ROS, and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, all of which were reversed by co-treatment with bpV(pic). Moreover, bpV(pic) induced significant protection against Aβ25-35-induced apoptosis, and effectively suppressed mitochondria-dependent apoptotic signaling triggered by Aβ25-35.
3:::Active' did not differ from 'inactive' patients with regard to temperament (BIS, BAS, and EC). Regressions with PA grouping as dependent variable (adjusted for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), depressive or eating disorder symptoms, or pain intensity) indicated an association between lower BMI and more PA in the preoperative and the post-operative group. In the post-operative group, in addition to lower BMI, also lower age and higher BIS reactivity contributed to more PA. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between BMI and BIS suggesting that low BMI was only associated with more PA in post-operative patients with high BIS.'
3:::Administration of aspirin with a dosage of 60 mg or 80 mg/kg initiated at 2 months after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus significantly reduced the frequency and duration of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Aspirin treatment also increased the number of newborn neurons with anatomic integration through improving the survival of the newly generated cells.
3:::The prevalence of IGD in the total samples ranged from 0.7% to 27.5%. The prevalence was higher among males than females in the vast majority of studies and tended to be higher among younger rather than older people in some studies. Geographical region made little difference to prevalence. Factors associated with IGD were reported in 28 of 37 cross-sectional studies. These were diverse and covered gaming, demographic and familial factors, interpersonal relations, social and school functioning, personality, psychiatric comorbidity, and physical health conditions. Longitudinal studies identified risk and protective factors, and health and social consequences of IGD. The natural course of IGD was diverse but tended to be more stable among adolescents compared to adults.
3:::Participants were primarily black (79%); 16% were Hispanic; 55% were female. Mean memory and EF scores at follow-up generally fell in the low-average to average range. Pairwise comparison of adjusted mean change from baseline to follow-up revealed significantly greater change for PHIV/non-C compared with PHEU youth in only one verbal recognition task, with a difference in mean changes for PHIV/non-C versus PHEU of -0.99 (95% CI: -1.80 to -0.19; P = 0.02). Among youth with PHIV, better immunologic status at baseline was positively associated with follow-up measures of verbal recall and recognition and cognitive inhibition/flexibility. Past AIDS-defining diagnoses and higher peak viral load were associated with lower performance across multiple EF tasks at follow-up.
3:::After adjustment for the confounding variables age and CD4 count, the CYP2B6 516 T-allele was protective against late HIV virologic breakthrough, adjusted OR 0.70; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.97.
3:::EBUS-TBNA was well tolerated with 97% sensitivity in distant metastatic disease, avoiding the need for distal metastases biopsy in 81% of cases. It had equivalent diagnostic accuracy in all NSCLC stages and in lymph nodes <10 mm, <20 mm or >20 mm (sensitivity >92% in all cases), with no mutation testing failures. EBUS-TBNA had 33% sensitivity in PET indolent (SUV < 4) nodes and 79% sensitivity in PET active nodes (SUV > 4). EBUS-TBNA diagnosed 12 cases of lymphoma without flow cytometry.
3:::Homogenous Ga-PSMA uptake of the lacrimal glands (SUVmax, 15.7 ± 7.2), parotid glands (SUVmax, 24.4 ± 8.1), submandibular glands (SUVmax, 26.7 ± 7.1), vocal cords (SUVmax, 8.4 ± 3), Waldeyer ring (SUVmax, 10.4 ± 4.3), liver (SUVmax, 8.2 ± 2.5), spleen (SUVmax, 10.9 ± 3.9), kidneys (SUVmax, 66.4 ± 25.4), and pars descendens duodeni (SUVmax, 17.6 ± 8.9) was observed in all patients. In 65% and 36%, respectively, homogenous Ga-PSMA uptake of the colon descendens (SUVmax, 10.6 ± 9.2) and the rectum (SUVmax, 3.7 ± 1.1) was found. Approximately 22% exhibited a Ga-PSMA uptake of the thyroid (SUVmax, 4.5 ± 1.2), and 21% exhibited a Ga-PSMA uptake of the knees synovia (SUVmax, 2.9 ± 0.2). Furthermore, Ga-PSMA uptake was found in 1 patient because of fibrous dysplasia of the right os ilium (SUVmax, 7.7).'
3:::A total of 146 studies were included in our meta-analysis. The RCADS showed robust internal consistency reliability in different assessment settings, countries, and languages. We only found that reliability of the RCADS was significantly moderated by the version of RCADS. However, these differences in reliability between different versions of the RCADS were slight and can be due to the number of items.
3:::A total of 2633 FNPS samples were collected, with two or more samples being obtained from 607 (97.4%) of subjects. Thirty-six (11.2%) subjects had influenza A or B in 2014, whereas all 19 (6.3%) subjects identified in 2015 had influenza A. Ninety-nine subjects reported influenza-like illness (ILI), and nine illness visits were arranged. Influenza vaccination was protective against ILI but not mild laboratory-confirmed influenza by surveillance. Moderate overall influenza VE of 42%-52% was observed for ILI, and subgroup analyses showed much higher VE for both ILI (70.9% vs 34.6%) and mild laboratory-confirmed influenza (44.0% vs -6.2%) in school-age children than preschoolers who were vaccinated within 12 months.
3:::Both Ga-DOTATATA PET/CT and MIBG SPECT/CT accurately identified 9 primary tumors, whereas FDG PET/CT showed increased activity in 8 of 9 primary tumors. Both Ga-DOTATATA and FDG PET/CT are able to detect associated extra-adrenal lesions not shown on MIBG study in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome.
3:::There were no reported clinical AEs. There were significant decreases in systolic BP (P < 0.001) and HR (P < 0.001) over time. In comparison, the diastolic BP increased significantly (P < 0.001). After removal of the last observation (supine position), there was no time-dependent change in systolic or diastolic BP, but the significant change in HR remained. The mean changes over the entire observation period were minimal (systolic BP, -6 to 5 mm Hg; diastolic BP, -2 to 3 mm Hg; HR, decrease of 5 beats/min). No patients developed hypotension. Fifty-five patients presented with hypertension at baseline, which increased by 1 CTCAE grade in 15 patients and by 2 grades in 2 patients. A large number of cases of asymptomatic (grade 1) bradycardia were observed, primarily in patients with preexisting bradycardia. One patient developed transient grade 1 tachycardia. No patients required medical intervention for cardiovascular perturbations.
3:::Eight of the 10 studies had significant increases in PA as a result of an E-health intervention. Studies that did not use a theoretical principle to underpin their intervention did not achieve successful results. Interventions based on social cognitive theory were very successful in achieving an increase in PA. The theory of planned behaviour had mixed results, with studies having contrasting results. Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART) goal principle was not effective in increasing PA but had positive findings in supplementary outcomes such as goal setting.
3:::A total of 35 eligible subjects underwent at least a partial surgical procedure. Palucorcel was administered in 33 eyes. Overall, 17.1% (6/35) of subjects experienced retinal detachments and 37.1% (13/35) experienced retinal perforations. No episodes of immune rejection or tumor formation were observed. At 1 year, ≥10- and ≥15-letter gains in best-corrected visual acuity were observed in 34.5% (10/29) and 24.1% (7/29) of eyes receiving palucorcel, respectively, and in 3.3% (1/30; for both) of fellow eyes.
3:::Ivacaftor determined a significant decrease in sweat chloride concentrations at all time points during treatment. Body mass index (BMI), FEV1 , and FVC showed an increasing trend. While C-reactive protein decreased significantly at 2 months, the opposite behavior was noticed for circulating monocytes. CFTR activity in MNC was found to increase significantly at 3 and 6 months. Neutrophil oxidative burst peaked at 2 months and then decreased to baseline. HVCN1 mRNA expression was significantly higher than baseline at 1-3 months and decreased after 6 months of treatment. The chloride efflux in MNC correlated positively with both FEV1 and FVC. On the other hand, sweat chloride correlated positively with CRP and WBC, and negatively with both respiratory function tests. A cluster analysis confirmed that sweat chloride, FEV1 , FVC, BMI, and MNC chloride efflux behaved as a single entity over time.
3:::We provide an update on the role of intestinal microbiome, metabolome and the gut-liver axis in ALD, discuss the growing body of evidence on the diversity of liver macrophages and their differential contribution to alcohol-induced liver inflammation, and highlight the crucial role of inflammasomes in integration of inflammatory signals in ALD. Studies to date have identified a multitude of new therapeutic targets, some of which are currently being tested in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis. These treatments aim to strengthen the intestinal barrier, ameliorate liver inflammation and augment hepatocyte regeneration.
3:::SMEs prioritized 53 ICF codes; 3 received 100% endorsement, 27 received ≥90% endorsement, whereas the remaining 23 received ≥80% endorsement. Prioritized ICF codes represent diverse domains, including pain, activities and participation, and emotional well-being. The review yielded 58 instruments; we retained 24 for content analysis.
3:::A total of 194 variants have been detected in this study, 24 of them were never described before. About 88% of the patients have a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant. Patients with null variants have a more severe phenotype than patients with defective variants, presenting with significantly higher levels of atherogenic particles (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B).
3:::TFPIα and TFPIβ mRNA levels were significantly increased in carotid plaques, whereas TF levels were unchanged as compared to healthy arteries. Antibodies against total TFPI showed elevated levels compared to antibodies against free TFPIα, both by immunohistochemical and ELISA detection in plaques. The antibody against total TFPI also co-localized with CD68 and the M1 and M2 markers CD80 and CD163, respectively. The TFPI mRNA expression was elevated and the procoagulant activity was decreased in M2 compared to M1 polarized human macrophages. TFPI was present in early foam cell formation and CC treatment increased the TFPI mRNA expression even further in M2 macrophages.
3:::High-HYP individuals exhibited an asymmetric belief revision for positive events, reflected by an exaggerated incorporation of better-than-expected and an impaired integration of worse-than-expected information, relative to their low-HYP control counterparts. The strength of this optimistic update bias was linked to the trait sensitivity of the behavioral approach system. Furthermore, high-HYP individuals demonstrated a more optimistic initial prediction bias, characterized by greater overestimations of their likelihood to experience positive events, and reported enhanced trait optimism.
3:::The median follow-up for all patients was 46.5 months (range, 8-105 months). Primary-site complete response was achieved in 42 of 42 cases (100%). Three-year overall survival, progression-free survival, and local control rates were 85.0%, 77.8%, and 91.7%, respectively. Delayed neck metastasis was detected in 5 of 42 cases (11.9%). Grade 3 or 4 toxic changes included oral mucositis in 92.9%, neutropenia in 21.4%, and thrombocytopenia in 4.8%. Grade 3 toxicities included anemia in 16.7%, radiation dermatitis in 9.5%, nausea in 4.8%, and fever in 2.4%.
3:::Notation of FEA ranged from 0% to 35% of the cases interpreted, with most pathologists noting FEA on 4 or more test cases. At least one participant noted FEA in 34 of the 72 benign non-FEA cases. For the 6 reference FEA cases, participant agreement with the case reference FEA diagnosis ranged from 17% to 52%; diagnoses noted by participating pathologists for these FEA cases included columnar cell hyperplasia, usual ductal hyperplasia, atypical lobular hyperplasia, and atypical ductal hyperplasia.
3:::The prevalence of T2D in Ontario FNs was 24.4%. A significant positive association between fish consumption of one portion per week and more and T2D compared to no fish consumption was found (OR=2.5 (95% CI: 1.38-4.58). Dietary DDE and PCBs intake was positively associated with T2D (OR=1.09 (95%CI: 1.05-1.75) for DDE and OR=1.07 (95%CI: 1.004-1.27) for PCBs) per unit increase in DDE/PCBs while n-3-FAs intake, adjusted for DDE/PCBs intake, showed an inverse effect against T2D among older individuals (OR=0.86 (95% CI: 0.46-0.99).
3:::Inter-assay agreement for qualitative results (prospective samples) was 88% (kappa=0.78). For the 127 samples with quantitative results in both assays, Aptima yielded on average slightly higher values (by 0.24LogIU/mL; Bland-Altman method) than RealTime. Concordance between assay results was excellent (R=0.98). At low VLs (0.8-3.3LogIU/mL), Aptima demonstrated good linearity and precision, similar to RealTime. Aptima detected and accurately quantified all main HCV genotypes.
3:::A total of 34 studies were included in the present review. Epidemiological data assessment suggests a possible association between total Hg concentrations in different biological matrices and incidence of DM or MS, but the relationship is not consistent. In vivo and in vitro studies support the biological plausibility of the relation between Hg exposure and DM or MS. Five out of nine of Bradford Hills criteria were fulfilled: strength, temporality, plausibility, coherence and analogy.'
3:::Of 845 eligible women selected, 774 (92%) consented to participate and completed the interview. A total of 512 (66%) women were aware of the legal status of the Ethiopian abortion law and their primary sources of information were electronic media such as television and radio (43%) followed by healthcare providers (38.7%). Among women with awareness of the law, 293 (57.2%) were poor in knowledge, 188 (36.7%) fairly knowledgeable, and 31 (6.1%) good in knowledge about the cases where abortion is allowed by law. Of the total 774 women included, 438 (56.5%) hold liberal and 336 (43.5%) conservative attitude toward legalization of abortion. In the multivariable logistic regression, age had a significant association with knowledge, whereas occupation had a significant association with attitude toward the law. Women who had poor knowledge toward the law were more likely to have conservative attitude toward the law (adjusted odds ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.61).
3:::The most affected finger was the right middle finger. All flaps survived and wounds healed in 14 days on average. The mucous cyst recurred in 1 of 33 cases. There were no major complications.
3:::IV alcohol significantly reduced AG but not TG levels with no difference between the two doses of alcohol. The percent change (%∆) in AG suppression was substantial in both high dose (43.4%∆), and low dose (39.5%∆) of alcohol. Also, fasting AG and TG levels were significant predictors of alcohol stimulant and sedative effects. Higher fasting ghrelin levels were associated with longer and more intense subjective effects.
3:::Of the 182 patients, 46.7% (n=85) achieved an SVR. Twenty-seven patients developed hepatic decompensation (one SVR) and 15 developed HCC (three SVR). Twenty-nine patients died (eight SVR). Twelve of the 29 deaths were liver related (two SVR). Independent factors associated with hepatic decompensation were NR to treatment [hazard ratio (HR)=23.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.90-189.25; P=0.003], advanced fibrosis at baseline (HR=9.11; 95% CI: 4.13-20.09), and treatment delay after diagnosis (HR=1.02; 95% CI: 1.00-1.03; P=0.012). Only the latter two were associated with HCC development and liver-related mortality. An assessment of liver fibrosis was performed on 125 patients (66 SVR). Fibrosis values were significantly lower in SVR patients, showing less progression to advanced stages of fibrosis [SVR: 6.6 (2.8); 95% CI: 5.8-7.3] than NR [NR: 14.0 (11.1); 95% CI: 11.1-16.9; P<0.001].
3:::A total of 274 new POAG patient visits from phase 1 and 280 visits from phase 2 were reviewed. After accounting for multiple comparisons, overall improvement approached statistical significance for the evaluation of visual function (91.2% to 96.1%, P < .02) and target intraocular pressure determination (73.7% to 83.2%, P < .01). Improvement for other measures that had a high rate of adherence at baseline (eg, ocular history, pupil examination, and central corneal thickness measurement) was not statistically significant.
3:::A 59-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of left hemicranial headaches with ptosis and binocular diplopia. Clinical evaluation found left third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with mydriasis and ptosis. An MRI showed an enhancing lesion at the clivus with infiltration of left cavernous sinus. A trans-sphenoidal biopsy was performed, leading to diagnosis of metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent treatment and achieved clinical improvement.
3:::Fifty-six patients were included (mean age 49 ± 14.3, 68.9% males and 39.3% history of smoking). Ever smokers had a higher fibrosis score than never smokers; two (IQR 0-3) versus one (IQR 1-1.5) (p = .040). Patients with advanced fibrosis smoked significantly more pack years than patients with no-early fibrosis; 10.6 (IQR 0-25.8) versus 0 (IQR 0-7) (p = .011). There is a weak to moderate correlation between fibrosis stage and number of pack years (Spearmans Rho = 0.341, p = .012). There was no difference in NAS between never and ever smokers; 2.8 ± 1.5 versus 3.3 ± 1.4 (p = .205). Patients with NAS <5 had a median number of pack years of 0 (IQR 0-9) versus a median of 10.3 pack years (IQR 0-24) in patients with NAS ≥5 (p = .127).'
3:::Eleven patients underwent cochlear implantation, 45% had severe-to-profound hearing loss, and 55% had bilateral profound hearing loss. The mean age at initial assessment was 2.1 years (median 1.7, range 0.6-7.5) and the mean age of implantation was 4.0 years (median 2.5, range 0.9-11.8). The mean length of follow-up was 4.8 years (median 2.3, range 1.5-14). Six patients had bilateral simultaneous implantation (55%), four bilateral sequential (36%), and one unilateral (9%). Nine patients had white matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging, largely in the periventricular and cortical regions. Of the 11 patients, 4 (36%) had associated neurological comorbidities and 3 (27%) had additional neurocognitive developmental delay of varying severity. The majority of patients showed improvement in auditory outcomes. No statistically significant correlation was found between age of implantation, neurocognitive, and neurological comorbidities or length of follow-up and hearing outcomes.
3:::The presence of the Met allele, 2 markers of the history of alcohol dependence (gamma glutamyl transferase and the number of past treatments in detoxification programs), and the presence of a depressive episode (but not depressive score) were significantly associated with the 2 blood levels of BDNF at baseline and after 6 months. After controlling for baseline BDNF levels, the presence of the Met allele and an ongoing depressive episode were the only variables associated with changes in BNDF levels after 6 months.
3:::In the case of [(11)C]flumazenil scans, Hypr-IDM-Hypr showed an increase of 5 to 20% in the regional V T whereas a 0 to 10% increase or decrease was seen in the case of [(11)C]PIB depending on the volume of interest or type of subject (healthy or patient). References for these comparisons were the V Ts from the PVE-uncorrected scans.
3:::Radiolabeling with (212)Pb in (224)Ra-solutions was more than 90% efficient after only 30min reaction time at TCMC-trastuzumab concentrations from 0.15mg/mL and higher. Separation of (212)Pb-labeled trastuzumab from (224)Ra using a PD-10 column was clearly superior to centrifugal separation. This method allowed recovery of approximately 75% of the (212)Pb-antibody-conjugate in the eluate, and the remaining amount of (224)Ra was only 0.9±0.8% (n=7).
3:::A 5-year survival rate of 152 patients was 81.56% (124/152). Positive COX-2 expression rate was 67.76% (103/152), and its positive expression was related to FIGO stage, differentiation degree, and myometrial invasion depth of patients (P < 0.05), but not to lymph node metastasis (P > 0.05). Positive expression rates of VEGF-C and EGFR were 64.47% (98/152) and 82.24% (125/152), respectively, and their positive expression was associated with FIGO stage, differentiation degree, myometrial invasion depth, and lymphatic metastasis (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis on the expression of COX-2 with VEGF-C and of EGFR found that COX-2 was positively correlated with both VEGF-C and EGFR (P < 0.05, r s > 0). Patient prognosis was associated with the FIGO stage, differentiation degree, and myometrial invasion depth of tumors, as well as the presence or absence of lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05) while showing no significant association with the postoperative adjuvant therapy (P > 0.05).
3:::Twelve patients, including 10 males and 2 females with median age 63.5 years, were referred. Clinical stage was IB (1 patient), IIB (2 patients), IIIA (8 patients), and IIIB (1 patient). There were no disease progression after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and all patients underwent curative resection. For 8 patients, pneumonectomy was avoided, with 3 bronchoplasties and 3 pulmonary arterial angioplasties. We had 4 pneumonectomies: three cases of metastatic enlarged lymph nodes invading either the carina or a more central portion of the pulmonary artery than the left A3 branch or vein which needs incision of the inner pericardium and 1 case with a tumor involving the upper lobe bronchus to the inferior lobe bronchus. There were no postoperative deaths and 1 case of bronchopleural fistula. The 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 55.6 and 72.7% without stump or anastomotic recurrence.
3:::The PCRs analytical sensitivity limit was 0.1 ng/ml for G. lamblia DNA, 0.01 ng/ml for E. histolytica DNA and 0.1 ng/ml for Cryptosporidium sp. In the test material, the assay performed similarly with fresh and dried stools. Of the 52 Guinea-Bissauan samples, local microscopy revealed a parasite in 15%, while PCR detected 62% positive for at least one parasite: 44% of the dried samples had Giardia, 23% Cryptosporidium and 0% E. histolytica.'
3:::Mitochodrial degeneration with swelling and cristae loss were detected in Sertoli cells and spermatogonial cells of TiO2-NP treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, autophagic vacuole accumulation were seen in Sertoli cell cytoplasms of the experimental groups. Necrosis was also detected in the 4mg TiO2-NP-treated group.
3:::More centres referred to the same speech and language therapist and/or neuropsychologist across all assessments; a core of assessment tools was routinely used across centres; fluency tasks were commonly used in the perioperative stages, and object naming during surgery; tasks that tapped on attention, executive functions, visuospatial awareness, calculation and emotions were sparsely administered; preoperative assessments were performed 1 month or 1 week before surgery; timing for postoperative assessments varied; finally, more centres recommended early rehabilitation, whenever needed.
3:::Seventy-one (71) LCS and 39 ZNS patients were identified. Average age at LCS initiation was 71.0±7.0 years and 49% were medically refractory. Average duration of follow up was 23.1±21.2 months. At last follow up, the retention rate was 60% and seizure freedom rate 52%. Of the 19 discontinuations due to side effects, 7 (37%) were due to dizziness/gait instability. No predictors of discontinuation were identified. Average age at ZNS initiation was 69.7±6.9 years and 51% were medically refractory. Average duration of follow up was 46.3±38.3 months. At last follow up, the retention rate was 64% and seizure freedom rate was 67%. Of the 12 discontinuations due to side effects, 4 (33%) were due to cognitive or behavioral side effects. Predictors of discontinuation included a lower starting dose.
3:::For younger women, AJCC 6th edition stage II cancer was the most common at diagnosis (40%), followed by stage I (34%). On the other hand, older women had more stage I (46%) cancer followed by stage II (34%). The excess costs for younger and older women at 12 months were $97,486 (95% confidence interval [CI] $93,631-101,341) and $75,737 (95% CI $73,962-77,512), respectively. Younger breast cancer patients had both a higher prevalence of later-stage disease and higher within-stage costs.
3:::Five eligible studies containing 3851 participants were included in our meta-analysis. Shorten telomere length was significantly associated with PTSD with mean difference of -0.19( 95% CI: -0.27, -0.01; P<0.001) with I-square of 96%. The results from subgroup analysis demonstrated that shorter telomere length was significantly associated with PTSD across all gender groups, with mean difference of -0.15( 95% CI: -0.29, -0.01; P=0.04) for female, mean difference of -0.17( 95% CI: -0.19, -0.15; P<0.001) for male. Meanwhile, shorten telomere length was significantly associated with sexual assault(mean difference =-0.15, 95% CI: -0.29, -0.01), childhood trauma (mean difference =-0.08, 95% CI: -0.19, -0.07), but not combat (mean difference =-0.39, 95% CI: -0.83, 0.05).
3:::We analyzed 20 samples of ascitic fluid from the patients of cardiac cirrhosis and compared with 48 samples of non-cirrhotic cardiac ascites. The AFP was significantly lower in patients with cardiac cirrhosis (3.66g/dl) as compared to non-cirrhotic patients (4.31g/dl, p < .01); while there was no difference in serum-ascites albumin gradient (1.48g/dl vs. 1.47g/dl, p = .95). AFP equal to or less than 4.3g/dl predicted cirrhosis with a sensitivity of 95% and negative likelihood ratio of 0.10; the corresponding ROC curve of AFP has an AUC of 0.777, higher than AUC of other noninvasive prediction models.
3:::A total of 445 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of breast were diagnosed during the study period. The median age of diagnosis was 67 years. The overall age-adjusted incidence between 1998 and 2013 was 0.62 per 1,000,000 per year, and the incidence has been on a decline. Approximately half of the tumors were poorly differentiated. Stage II was the most common stage at presentation. Majority of the cases were negative for expression of estrogen and progesterone receptor. One-third of the cases underwent breast conservation surgery while more than half of the cases underwent mastectomy (unilateral or bilateral). Approximately one-third of cases received radiation treatment. The 1-year and 5-year cause-specific survival was 81.6 and 63.5%, respectively. Excluding patient with metastasis or unknown stage at presentation, in multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, older age at diagnosis and higher tumor stage (T3 or T4) or nodal stage at presentation were significant predictors of poor survival.
3:::Data for analyses were available on 10 516 participants, of whom 5082 (48%) were men. The mean age was 49 (±9.4) years for men and 48 (±9.3) years among women. A total of 3270 participants had hypertension (age-standardized rates, 33%), and n = 1807 (49%) of these participants were aware of their diagnosis. Of those with hypertension, n = 1754, (47%) were treated and only n = 673, (19%) had controlled blood pressure levels. Only 17% (n = 541) of those treated for hypertension received two or more blood pressure-lowering medications and 15% (n = 499) received statins. The prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of blood pressure were higher among women and older (50-69 years) participants compared with men and younger individuals (30-49 years) (P < 0.0001 for all). The prevalence was higher in rural communities; however, awareness, treatment, and control were significantly higher among urban dwellers.
3:::Of 1137 nurses who received surveys, 976 (87%) responded. Among the respondents, 75% reported being very satisfied or satisfied with their jobs, but there was a high level of burnout, and 22.5% of the nurses expressed their intention to leave the ED within the following year (p<0.05). Nurses satisfaction and burnout were associated with intention to leave. Salary, nurse-patient relationships, nurse staffing and work environment were areas where nurses were less satisfied, while group cohesion was associated with greater satisfaction.'
3:::Higher performance rates of mammography and colonoscopy among BC survivors were observed, as well as a greater likelihood of receiving an influenza vaccine and undergoing a bone mineral density scan (adjusted-ORs: 7.7, 1.48, 1.42, and 2.59, respectively) compared to controls. Factors identified with compliance to selected practices were age, higher levels of education and income, never smoking, and strenuous physical activity. The survivors adopted healthier lifestyles, which were similar to those of women who never had cancer.
3:::The compressive and cooling effect of the system was well tolerated by all the patients at the temperature set. Four patients complained of noise due to machine operation, but in none the treatment was interrupted. The average length of hospital stay was 2.8±0.4days. No clinically significant hematoma was observed at discharge and after one month follow-up visit.
3:::A total of 21 eyes of 21 patients underwent ab interno bleb revision with the Grover-Fellman biplanar sclerostomy spatula. Mitomycin C was given at least 1 week preoperation. The mean age of the patients and blebs were 67 and 6.75 years, respectively. The mean follow-up is 10.6 months (range: 3 to 17 mo). Mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) (SD) was 21.9 (9.1) mm Hg on 3.7 (1.2) glaucoma medications. At 12 months follow-up, the mean IOP was 12.1 mm Hg on 0.86 medications. Four eyes failed due to uncontrolled IOP needing a tube shunt. One eye failed due to uncontrolled IOP but was lost to follow-up before a tube shunt could be performed. All failures occurred within 3 months. Two eyes had an IOP of <5 mm Hg after 1 month with no evidence of hypotony maculopathy. These cases resolved after 3 months without surgical intervention. All successful cases had blebs that were low, diffuse, and posterior.
3:::The findings showed ALN metastasis in 52 patients (40.6%). The (18)F-FDG PET/CT procedure had a sensitivity of 48.1% and a specificity of 94.7% for ALN metastasis. In the ROC analysis of pSUVmax for ALN metastasis, the optimal cutoff value was 3.9 for all the patients, 2.8 for the luminal A subtype, 3.3 for the luminal B (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative) subtype, 5.3 for the luminal B (HER2-positive) subtype, 12.7 for the HER2-positive subtype, and 11.5 for the triple-negative subtype. A predictive ALN metastasis model using nodal (18)F-FDG uptake finding gave a c-statistic of 0.714, and a model combination of nodal (18)F-FDG uptake finding with pSUVmax of all the patients gave a c-statistic of 0.736 (P = 0.3926). However, the combination of nodal the (18)F-FDG uptake finding with the pSUVmax of each molecular subtype gave a c-statistic of 0.791 (P = 0.0047).
3:::Ninety patients with an equal distribution of type A, B or C projection in the AP pelvis were evaluated and compared to the morphology in the 3D-CT reconstruction. The projection of the AIIS below the acetabular sourcil (B + C) showed only moderate sensitivity (0.76) and specificity (0.64) for a hypertrophic AIIS (Hetsroni type II + III), but if the AIIS exceeds the anterior rim, all cases showed a hypertrophic AIIS in the 3D-CT reconstructions (Hetsroni type II + III).
3:::Seventeen consecutive patients with a mean baseline tumor height of 1.67 mm (range, 1.31-2.03 mm) and median follow-up time of 7.0 months (range, 3.3-19.5 months) were included. The 27-gauge cutter biopsy yielded sufficient material for multiplex-ligation probe amplification (MLPA) or gene expression profiling (GEP) in 17/17 (100%) patients. Complications were limited to focal vitreous hemorrhage in 13/17 patients and diffuse vitreous hemorrhage in 1/17 patients, with no instance of retinal detachment or nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage.
3:::Because children with Downs syndrome and cleft palate are susceptible to OME, we categorized OME into low-risk and high-risk groups (e.g., Down's syndrome and cleft palate), and recommended the appropriate treatment for each group.'
3:::Of 795 outpatients (median age 18.5 years, interquartile range 13.4-27.1 years) referred for congenital cardiac MR, a total of 91 patients (11.4%) missed appointments; 28 (3.5%) missed multiple appointments. Reason for missed appointment could be identified in only 38 patients (42%), but of these, 28 (74%) were preventable or could have been identified prior to the appointment. In multivariable analysis, independent predictors of missed appointments were referral by a non-cardiologist (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 5.8, P=0.0002), referral for research (AOR 3.6, P=0.01), having public insurance (AOR 2.1, P=0.004), and having scheduled cardiac MR from November to April (AOR 1.8, P=0.01).
3:::The stress-strain curve was nonlinear in both accelerated transepithelial and epithelium-off CXL groups. The stress and elastic moduli were all significantly higher in both experimental groups compared with the control group (P < 0.05), whereas there were no significant differences between the 2 treatment groups (P > 0.05). Six months after the operation, hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy showed that the subcutaneous collagen fibers were arranged in a regular pattern, and the fiber density was higher in the experimental groups.
3:::Genetic testing exonerated ACVR1 as culpable for the patients toe malformation. CGH and SNP analyses identified a large intragenic deletion in a different BMP Type 1 receptor gene, BMP Receptor 1B/Activin-like kinase 6 (BMPR1B/ALK6), a gene associated with a variable spectrum of autosomal dominant brachydactyly phenotypes.'
3:::Among the 42 patients (77.8%) with breast cancer, 10 (18.5%) kidney cancer and 2 (3.7%) neuroendocrine cancer, adverse events were reported in 75.9% of the patients (everolimus termination in 25.9% patients). C0 everolimus higher than 26.3ng/mL (Sen=0.38,Spe=0.88) were associated with a 4-fold increased risk of toxicity (HR=4.12, IC95%=[1.48-11.5], p=0.0067) whereas C0 lower than 11.9ng/mL were associated with a 3-fold increased risk of progression (HR=3.2, IC95%=[1.33-7.81],p=0.001).
3:::Seventy-four patients were included in the study, 37 (50%) were female, mean age 41 years, 61 (82%) had Crohns disease, and 42 (57%) ulcerative colitis. Forty-two (57%) patients received IFX and 32 (43%) ADA. Mean IFX trough was 3.6 μg/mL and mean ADA troughs were 3.78 μg/mL. Twenty-seven percent of patients (n = 20) overall had a poor outcome, with a similar proportion in each group 24% (n = 10) IFX and 31% (n = 10) ADA (P value 0.24). Of the cohort, 14.2% (6/42) treated with IFX had subtherapeutic trough levels, 6.2% (2/32) of ADA patients had a trough level <1 μg/mL (P value = 0.273) There was no difference in mean trough according to outcome (4.9 μg/mL poor versus 5.4 μg/mL good, P value 0.14). Low IFX trough levels did correlate with high CRP, low albumin and response rates, mean CRP 6.66 μg/mL (n = 3), mean albumin 37 g/L for patients with low trough levels and poor response versus CRP 2.0 μg/mL (n = 24), mean albumin 43 g/L for patients with high trough levels and good response (P = 0.009, 95% confidence interval, -0.78 to -0.12).'
3:::A total of 176 patients (mean age 9y 5mo, range 2y 4mo-19y 6mo; 104 males, 72 females) with CP and 55 typically developing individuals (mean age 13y 6mo, range 2y 5mo-19y 10mo; 37 males, 18 females) in a comparison group were enrolled in this study. Statistical modelling showed that all three directional acetabular indices independently increased with GMFCS level (p<0.001) and migration percentage (p<0.001).
3:::HOK expressed the receptors LPA1, LPA5 and LPA6 and LPA activated the ERK1/2, JNK and p38 intracellular pathways, substantiated by secretion of IL-6 and IL-8. The early (2h) and intermediate (6h) gene expression profiles of HOK after LPA treatment showed a wide array of regulated genes. The majority of the strongest upregulated genes were related to chemotaxis and inflammation, and became downregulated after 6h. At 6h, genes coding for factors involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and re-epithelialization became highly expressed. IL-36γ, not earlier known to be regulated by LPA, was strongly transcribed and translated but not secreted.
3:::Morris water maze (MWM) test results showed that LPS increased escape latency compared to control group whereas TQ decreased them vs. LPS group. In passive avoidance (PA) test, LPS reduced the latency to enter the dark compartment vs. control group, while TQ treatment attenuated this effect of LPS. Additionally, LPS increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-α) in the hippocampal tissues. It also elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites and decreased thiol content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in both hippocampus and cortex vs. control group, while TQ decreased IL-6, TNF-α, MDA and NO metabolites and increased thiol content, SOD and CAT compared to LPS group.
3:::LN metastases with a diameter<1cm were more visible on (18)F-5-FPN PET imaging than (18)F-FDG imaging. Quantitative analysis showed that the uptake of (18)F-5-FPN was significantly higher than that of (18)F-FDG, with values of 13.29±3.80% ID/g and 7.24±1.95% ID/g (n=5, P<0.05), respectively. LN-to-muscle ratios were 21.23±6.02 and 4.50±2.11 (n=5, P<0.01) for (18)F-5-FPN and (18)F-FDG, respectively. Biodistribution results were similar, with high uptake of (18)F-5-FPN in the LN. (18)F-5-FPN imaging manifested the pulmonary lesions clearly, while the (18)F-FDG imaging showed no uptake in lesions <2mm. The related uptakes of (18)F-5-FPN and (18)F-FDG were 3.12±1.17% ID/g and 1.48±0.15% ID/g, respectively (n=5, P<0.05), with lung metastasis-to-muscle ratios of 8.16±3.12 and 1.28±0.18 (n=5, P<0.01), respectively. H&E and Prussian blue staining displayed pluri nucleated or mega nucleus cells and dark brown granules in the metastatic tissues, characteristic of melanoma.
3:::Administration of the acidic solution potentiated dentin hypersensitivity and increased corticosterone levels in the ED group compared with the WD group. TNF-α levels only increased in the WD group. The ED group exhibited an increase in astrocytic GFAP expression in the hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex but decreases in the hippocampus.
3:::Of 21 patients with clinical PNI from cutaneous HNSCC, 7 patients (33%) were previously treated for their disease with primary radiotherapy. Negative tumor margins were achieved in 18 patients (86%). Three of the 7 patients (43%) undergoing salvage surgery had positive margins. One-year and 3-year DFS for previously untreated patients was 91% and 67%, respectively, whereas 1-year and 3-year DFS was 72% and 28%, respectively, for the previously treated patients. Previous radiotherapy, ophthalmic nerve involvement, and positive margins portended poorer survival outcomes in this study.
3:::Continuous EEG recording was successfully performed for up to 63 days in 99 mice, for a total of 1872 days of EEG data. Continuous drug infusion with continuous EEG recording was successfully performed for up to 22 days.
3:::Among 145 MAs imaged with SDOCT, 47 (32.4%) appeared as hyperreflective, 71 (49.0%) as moderately reflective, and 27 (18.6%) as hyporeflective. After excluding 3 eyes (10 MAs) because of poor-quality OCTA scans, 135 MAs were evaluated on OCTA; 76 (56.3%) were visible only in the DCP, 9 (6.7%) only in the SCP, 29 (21.5%) were visible in both SCP and DCP; and 21 (15.6%) were not visible on OCTA. Compared with MAs with hyperreflectivity or moderate reflectivity, MAs with hyporeflectivity on structural SDOCT were significantly less likely to be detected on OCTA (odds ratio [OR]: 4.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5-14.0, P = .008; and OR: 4.2, 95% CI: 1.2-14.2, P = .022, respectively).
3:::IL-10 concentration was significantly increased in early-stage patients compared to late-stage patients, healthy siblings and controls whereas TNF-α concentration was significantly increased in late-stage patients compared to controls. Total leukocytes, neutrophil and monocyte count were significantly increased in late-stage patients compared to healthy siblings and controls. The concentration of IL-6, neurotrophin-3 and BDNF was unchanged in euthymia. Healthy siblings did not show significant changes in any biomarker.
3:::AF sources arose in 96/97 (99%) patients for 2.6±1.4 sources per patient (left atrium: 1.7±0.9 right atrium: 1.1±0.8), each with an area of 2-3cm(2). On area analyses, the probability of an AF source randomly overlapping a GP area was 26%. Left atrial sources were seen in 94 (97%) patients, in whom ≥1 source co-localized with GP in 75 patients (80%; p<0.05). AF sources were more likely to colocalize with left vs right GPs (p<0.05), and colocalization was more likely in patients with higher CHADS2VASc scores (age>65, diabetes; p<0.05).
3:::All patients showed uneventful healing after MSFA, and dental implant installation was possible in all patients after 6 months. Histological analysis showed newly formed bone that was primarily woven in nature; it was organized in thin trabeculae, and it was occasionally in contact with residual bone substitute particles, which appeared in various forms and sizes and in advanced stage of degradation. Mean bone area was 43.4% (CI95 38.9; 47.8) for the BC group and 43.0% (CI95 36.6; 49.5) for the BC + EMD group. Mean soft tissue area was 21.3% (CI95 16.5; 26.2) for BC group and 21.5% (CI95 17.7; 25.3) for BC + EMD group, while the remaining biomaterial was 35.3% (CI95 36.6; 49.5) and 35.5% (CI95 29.6; 41.3) for BC and BC + EMD group, respectively.
3:::The mean number of images obtained per eye was 917 ± 353. The average sensitivity of LS-IVCM for detecting fungal filaments was 71.4% ± 0% for the experienced observers and 42.9% ± 6.7% for the inexperienced observers. The average specificity was 89.6% ± 3.0% and 87.5% ± 17.7% for these 2 groups of observers, respectively. Although there was a good agreement between the 2 experienced observers (κ = 0.77), the inexperienced observers showed only a moderate interobserver agreement (κ = 0.51). The LS-IVCM sensitivity was higher in patients with fungal infections who had positive culture or longer duration of the disease.
3:::Obstructions were tumor-related in 334 (68%) patients, adhesion-related in 96 (20%), and of unclear etiology in 60 (12%). The obstruction site was the gastric outlet in 78 (16%), small bowel in 312 (64%), and large bowel in 100 (20%). Treatment was classified as medical (49% of patients), surgical (32%), and procedural (interventional radiology or endoscopy) (17%). Sixty-eight percent of patients were eating at the time of discharge, and 42% died within 90 days of surgical consultation. Median overall survival rates for patients managed with procedural, medical, and surgical treatment were 69, 135, and 314 days, respectively (p < 0.001). Intact primary/local recurrence, carcinomatosis, and albumin level <3.5 g/dL were negatively associated with eating at discharge. Compared with medical management, surgery was not associated with the ability to eat. Variables associated with death within 90 days of consultation included an intact primary/local recurrence, carcinomatosis, abdominal visceral metastasis, and procedural treatment.
3:::Challenging of the cardiomyocytes with DOX resulted in increasing in cardiomyocyte oxidative stress and apoptosis. In addition, levels of Mfn2 in cardiomyocytes were decreased after the cells were challenged with DOX which was associated with increased mitochondrial fission (fragmentation) and mitochondrial ROS production. An increase in cardiomyocyte levels of Mfn2 attenuated the DOX-induced increase in mitochondrial fission and prevented cardiomyocyte mitochondrial ROS production. An increase in cardiomyocyte levels of Mfn2 or pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with an anti-oxidant, Mito-tempo, also prevented the DOX-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
3:::The results of this review showed that gallstone ileus etiology was due to intestinal obstruction from a gallstone that migrated into the intestinal lumen through a bilioenteric fistula. The presence of 2 of the 3 Riglers triad signs was considered diagnostic. Abdominal tomography was the imaging study of choice for gallstone ileus diagnosis and the surgical procedures for management were enterolithotomy, one-stage surgery, and two-stage surgery. Enterolithotomy had lower morbidity and mortality than the other 2 procedures.'
3:::A total of 3256 persons were present at the physical training camp. During the outbreak, 405 (68.3%) possible cases and 26 (4.4%) confirmed cases were reported before the intervention and completed oseltamivir treatment; 162 (27.3%) possible cases were reported after the intervention and received part treatment and part prophylaxis. The other 2663 participants completed oseltamivir prophylaxis. Of the possible cases, 181 with fever ≥38.5°C were isolated. The actual attack rate for this outbreak of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 was 18.2%, which is much lower than the theoretical attack rate of 80% projected.
3:::Two previously reported mutations and one novel mutation,p. Cys562Tyr, were found. All mutations reduced CD18/CD11 heterodimer expression.
3:::HCV and HBV co-infection among the 677 PLHIV was found to be 19% (95% confidence interval (CI) 16.6-22.7%) and 4.4% (95% CI 3.1-6.6%), respectively. The Eastern Region had the highest percentage of HCV infection (48%). The age group with the highest rates of co-infection was 30-39 years (58% and 70%, respectively, for HCV and HBV co-infection). After adjusting for confounding, males were more likely to have HBV co-infection than females (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.61, 95% CI 1.42-14.98). Similarly, PLHIV who were male (AOR 5.7, 95% CI 2.06-15.98), had a secondary level of education (AOR 3.04, 95% CI 1.06-8.70), or who were drug users (AOR 28.7, 95% CI 14.9-55.22) were significantly more likely to have HCV co-infection.
3:::The overall social profiles of this NEET population was diverse, but with globally more difficult living conditions than in the general population. Health-related vulnerability factors identified were: insufficient health insurance; low educational level; numerous adverse experiences during childhood and social isolation. Some of their health indicators were remarkably poor in comparison with participants in the Baromètre santé study: 19.2 % (CI95 %=[17.2-21.3]) had a chronic disease-versus 8.2 % (CI95 %=[7.0-9.4]) (P<0.001); 31.9 % (CI95 %=[26.8-37.4]) were overweight or obese-versus 17.9 % (CI95 %=[16.3-19.6]) (P<0.001) and 19.6 % (CI95 %=[15.2-23.9]) were depressed-versus 7.3 %(CI95 %=[3.8-10.9]) (P<0.001). Compared with participants of the SIRS survey, fewer (70.4 %) (CI95 %=[68.0-72.7]) had a family doctor-versus 79.7 % (CI95 %=[73.1-86.2]) (P<0.05). Among the women in the Presaje survey, 38.0 % [30.5-45.4] had a regular gynecological follow-up-versus 80.9 % (CI95 %=[71.5-90.4]) in the SIRS survey (P<0.001).
3:::Between May 2010 (the date on which the Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery Department of our new Hospital began the surgical activity) and December 2016, 33 (median age, 86 years-old) of the 2625 hip fractures were classified as simultaneous extra- and intra-capsular ipsilateral fractures. The overall cumulative incidence was of 1.3% (95%CI:0.9-1.8%). In 32 (97%) of the patients, the fracture was a consequence of a low energy trauma (ground level fall), while the remainder was due to a medium energy trauma (skating). In all cases the two fracture lines seem to be independent of each other, which suggests different mechanisms of injury from that of isolated subcapital or intrertrochanteric fracture.
3:::The study population consisted of 110 pregnancies, 55 in the historical cohort and 55 in the current treatment cohort. At the time of admission, mean gestational age in both groups was 29.3 and 29.7 weeks. In the historical and current treatment cohort the length of the hospitalization was 24.0 and 5.5 days and tocolysis was given for 19.5 and 3.4 days, respectively. In the historical cohort, mean gestational age at delivery was 35.6 weeks. In 63.6% cases delivery occurred prior to 37 weeks. In the current treatment group mean gestational age at the delivery was 37.0 weeks and 36.4% were delivered prior to 37 weeks.
3:::Mean patient age at surgery was 50 years. Two patients were female and one was male. In the three cases, the initial lesion was a posterior elbow dislocation, associated with a fracture of the radial shaft in one and a radial head fracture and coronoid fracture, respectively, in the other two. Due to persistent elbow instability, an external fixator was applied in all three cases. The fixator pins were introduced percutaneously in two cases and under direct vision in an open manner in the third case. Radial palsy was noted immediately postoperatively in all cases. It was permanent in two cases and temporary in the third.
3:::The prevalence of anemia at baseline was 11.5% in FDS2 participants, 17.8% in BDS type 2 patients and 5.4% in BDS participants without diabetes. In FDS2, 163 of 178 patients with anemia (91.6%) had at least one other risk factor (serum vitamin B12<140pmol/L, serum ferritin <30μg/L and/or transferrin saturation<20%, serum testosterone <10nmol/L (males), glitazone therapy, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60mL/min 1.73m(2), malignancy, hemoglobinopathy). More anemic than non-anemic FDS2 patients died (28.7% versus 8.0%; P<0.001). After adjustment for other independent predictors (age as time-scale, male sex, Aboriginality, marital status, smoking, eGFR), anemia was associated with a 57% increase in mortality (P=0.015).
3:::After adjustment for potential confounders, non-significant associations with RCC were observed for total adiponectin (OR for highest vs. lowest quartile = 0.65, 95% CI 0.37-1.14; p trend = 0.35), HMW adiponectin (0.67, 0.38-1.17; p trend = 0.36), IGF-1 (1.35, 0.77-2.39; p trend = 0.17), IGFBP-3 (1.47, 0.83-2.62; p trend = 0.53), and C-peptide (1.52, 0.86-2.70; p trend = 0.15). In a joint analysis with body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)), obese individuals (BMI ≥30) with above-median levels of IGFBP-3 had a significantly higher risk versus those with BMI <25 and below-median IGFBP-3 (OR 2.42, 1.11-5.26), whereas obese individuals with low IGFBP-3 did not (1.18, 0.53-2.64) (p interaction = 0.35).
3:::Among 399 cases, the upgrade rate to cancer was 16.0%, (95% CI: 12.8-20.0%), with nine invasive cancers and 55 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) only. Via a logistic regression approach, we defined a subgroup with low risk for upgrade: women whose biopsies showed no individual cell necrosis, and either a) 1 focus of ADH with ≥50% removal, or b) 2-3 foci with ≥90% removal. Cases meeting these criteria had an upgrade rate of 4.9% (95% CI: 1.0-8.9%), compared to 21.4% (16.4-26.3%) in cases that did not meet this low-risk definition.
3:::Velocity and vorticity within the surgical valve sinuses reached peak values of 0.7 m/s and 1000 s(-1), with a 70% decrease in peak fluid shear stress near the aortic side of the leaflet in the noncoronary sinus. With the introduction of transcatheter aortic valves, peak velocity and vorticity were reduced to approximately 0.4 m/s and 550 s(-1) and 0.58 m/s and 653 s(-1) without coronary flow and 0.60 m/s and 631 s(-1) and 0.81 m/s and 669 s(-1) with coronary flow for the CoreValve and Sapien valve-in-valve implantations, respectively. Peak shear stress was approximately 38% higher along the aortic side of the coronary versus noncoronary transcatheter aortic valve leaflet.
3:::Three hundred forty patients were admitted in the study period and 222 patients met the inclusion criteria. Males contributed to 59.5% of hip fractures. Falls from standing height constituted the majority of fractures (76%) followed by injury from road traffic crashes (14%). Regardless of high- or low-energy aetiology, intertrochanteric fracture dominated representing 54.5% of all hip fractures. 75.6% (n = 168) of the analysed patients had fragility fractures. The fragility fractures were 55.8% (n = 96) intertrochanteric, 28.5% (n = 49) cervical, 9.9% (n = 17) subtrochanteric, and 5.8% (n = 10) mixed subtrochanteric with intertrochanteric. We noted a 2.34% per year increase in the proportions of fragility fractures among all included hip fractures over 5 years.
3:::The series selection of items resulted in a 9-item questionnaire, namely Huaxi Emotional-distress Index (HEI). The Cronbachs α coefficient of HEI was 0.90. The PCA results showed a unidimensional construct. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.88 when compared with MINI interview. Using the optimal cut-off score of HEI (11/12), the sensitivity and specificity were 0.880 and 0.766, respectively.'
3:::A total 294 images were included in the analysis. The interobserver ICCs were TCD-AF = 0.85 (0.76-0.91), TCD-MF = 0.9 (0.83-0.94), vermis height = 0.79 (0.66-0.88), anterior-posterior vermis diameter = 0.71 (0.5-0.84), width of the fourth ventricle = 0.72 (0.33-0.9), height of the fourth ventricle = 0.86 (0.7-0.92). The ICC for the TCD comparing the AF and the MF approach was ≥0.9 for both observers.
3:::In this sample, over one-third (38.0%) of Medicare Part D prescribers received industry payments in 2013. The mean annual generic drug prescribing rate was highest among prescribers receiving no payments and lowest among those receiving more than $500 of industry payments (77.5% vs. 71.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). The receipt of industry payments was independently associated with prescribers generic drug prescribing rate; higher payments corresponded with lower generic drug prescribing rates. Other prescriber characteristics associated with higher annual generic drug prescribing rate included male sex, non-northeast region, specialty, and patient volume.'
3:::In uncomplicated preterm infants (n = 103 [48%]), LV GLS and GLSRs remained unchanged from days 5 to 7 to 1 year CA (P = .60 and P = .59). RV free wall longitudinal strain, RV free wall longitudinal strain rate, and IVS GLS and GLSRs significantly increased over the same time period (P < .01 for all measures). A significant base-to-apex (highest to lowest) segmental longitudinal strain gradient (P < .01) was seen in the RV free wall and a reverse apex-to-base gradient (P < .01) in the LV free wall. In infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia and/or pulmonary hypertension (n = 119 [51%]), RV free wall longitudinal strain and IVS GLS were significantly lower (P < .01), LV GLS and GLSRs were similar (P = .56), and IVS segmental longitudinal strain persisted as an RV-dominant base-to-apex gradient from 32 weeks postmenstrual age to 1 year CA.
3:::Compared to (R)-isometheptene, (S)-isometheptene produced greater vasopressor responses, whilst both compounds equipotently increased heart rate. The tachycardic responses to (S)-isometheptene were abolished after propranolol, but remained unaffected by the other antagonists. In contrast, the vasopressor responses to (S)-isometheptene were practically abolished after prazosin. Interestingly, after reserpine, the tachycardic responses to (S)-isometheptene were abolished, whereas its vasopressor responses were attenuated and subsequently abolished by prazosin.
3:::The number of dermal M1 cells was significantly lower pretreatment compared with post-treatment (P < 0.01). The numbers of dermal M2 cells were also numerically decreased by treatment. These results did not change significantly after exclusion of the patients who had recurrence (n = 2). There were no statistically significant differences between groups classified by stage, lesion type or treatment outcome.
3:::Among 887 randomly selected patients with BCLC-B HCC, 83 underwent liver resection as first or second treatment and 597 had non-surgical treatment. After propensity score matching, the two groups were well balanced (80 patients in each group). Overall median survival in the resection group was better than that for patients receiving non-surgical treatment (50·9 versus 22·1 months respectively; P < 0·001). The 1-, 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates in the resection group were 90, 88, 75 and 63 per cent, compared with 79, 48, 35 and 22 per cent in the no-surgery group (P < 0·001). In multivariable analysis, non-surgical treatment only (hazard ratio (HR) 3·35, 95 per cent c.i. 2·16 to 5·19; P < 0·001), albumin level below 3·5 g/dl (HR 1·96, 1·22 to 3·15; P = 0·005) and largest tumour size greater than 5·0 cm (HR 1·81, 1·20 to 2·75; P = 0·005) were independent predictors of worse overall survival.
3:::Twenty-two advanced NSCLC patients were enrolled in the study. In a total of 66 blood specimens, the median EGFRm frequency was 7.13% (range 0-35.09%), and among them six specimens had less than 1.0% EGFRm frequency. Moreover, one time-point blood specimen did not display any EGFRm, even by droplet digital PCR. The frequency of EGFRm changed dynamically across different time-points within one day, but the differences were not significant (P = 0.557). We observed that patients with a relatively high frequency of EGFRm (>6.76%) had a better response to gefitinib (P = 0.024).
3:::Two siblings had situs inversus and complex heart defects suggestive of ciliary dysfunction. The affected girl who died in utero showed severe chest abnormalities compatible with Jeune syndrome which were not present in the affected boy. Dental investigations in the boy showed typical signs of molar-incisor-malformation. Exome sequencing identified a homozygous intragenic deletion in TCTEX1D2 which is predicted to completely remove protein function. Ciliary function tests and electron microscopy showed mild irregularities of motile cilia such as compound cilia and loss of membranes.
3:::Changes were observed in attitude towards climate change and sustainability and to the inclusion of these topics within the nursing curricula (p=0.000). Participants demonstrated greater knowledge of natural resource use and the cost of waste disposal following the session (p=0.000). Participants also reported that sessions were realistic, and levels of agreement with statements supporting the value of the session and the interactive nature of delivery were higher following the session.
3:::A quadratic curved relationship between PEEP and flow was observed (coefficients were 8.97 × 10(-3) for flow and 4.79 × 10(-4) for a quadratic element of flow, respectively) but evanished when the mouth was open. The PEEP increased along with lung compliance (coefficient was 2.58 × 10(-3)). Despite the difference in working curves, both the mechanical ventilators performed slightly better than the AIRVO 2 device at higher flows (40 and 50 L/min).
3:::The mpMRI led to ""suspicious"" upstaging in 56 patients (15.4%). Significant PCa (98.2% vs. 74.6%, P<0.001) and adverse PCa (85.7% vs. 32.6%, P<0.001) were more common in patients with suspicious upstaging. The sensitivity/specificity of mpMRI for significant PCa and adverse PCa were 25.4%/98.2% and 32.4%/96.3%, respectively. On multivariate analyses, suspicious upstaging on mpMRI (odds ratio: 15.82, P = 0.007) was a predictor for significant PCa in addition to PRIAS criteria and age at diagnosis. In addition, suspicious upstaging on mpMRI (odds ratio: 11.11, P<0.001) was a significant predictor for adverse PCa in addition to PRIAS criteria, age at diagnosis, and body mass index.
3:::Spatial autocorrelation was detected in SMRs, possibly reflecting underlying social and behavioural risk factors, but consistent with infectious disease spread. SMRs for IP were consistently predictive of SMRs for AMI and IHD when adjusted for socioeconomic status, population density and per cent Indigenous population (coefficient: 0.707, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.318 - 1.096; 0.553, 0.222 - 0.884; 0.598, 0.307 - 0.888 and 1.017, 0.711 - 1.323; 0.650, 0.342 - 0.958; 1.031, 0.827 - 1.236) in 2007, 2008 and 2009, respectively.
3:::The first analysis produced a negative result because the three anovas found no effect of model or interaction of model and group (F6,294 < 3.1, p > 0.08). There was an effect of group only for the anova with the ST sector (F6,294 = 12.2, p < 0.001). The second analysis also produced a negative result, because ROC areas were in the range 0.69-0.72 for all models. The third analysis found that even when variability in MD was low, the CoV was so large that test-retest variation could include 100% loss of ganglion cells.
3:::Of 90 infants (49 males, 41 females; mean 13mo, standard deviation [SD] 2.5mo; range 7-17mo); 25 (28%) had profound visual impairment (light perception at best) and 65 (72%) had severe visual impairment (basic form' vision). The Near Detection Scale correlated significantly with sensorimotor understanding developmental quotients in the 'total', 'simple', and 'complex' groups (all p<0.001). Age and vision accounted for 48% of sensorimotor understanding variance. Infants with profound visual impairment, especially in the 'complex' group with congenital disorders of the peripheral visual system with known brain involvement, showed the greatest cognitive delay.'
3:::Among 60 subjects ≤40years of age, 77% had dyslipidemia, 70% high lipoprotein(a), 53.33% elevated hs-CRP and 73.33% raised homocysteine. hs-CRP (9.33 vs. 3.33, p value=0.01) and serum triglycerides (178.67 vs. 141.42, p value=0.03) were markedly raised in patients with ACS. Statistically significant number of patients in the ACS group had positive remodelling (ACS, 69.7% vs. CSA, 14.8%; p value<0.001), low attenuation plaque (ACS, 63.6% vs. CSA, 11.1%; p value<0.001), spotty calcification (ACS, 36.4% vs. CSA, 3.7%; p=0.002) and non-calcified plaque (ACS, 69.7% vs. CSA, 11.1%; p<0.001). On multivariate analysis, only lipoprotein (a) >30mg/dL and composite vulnerability score maintained a predictive value for ACS in patients ≤40years. Statistically significant number of patients in the younger age group had higher mean total plaque volume (66.17±41.31mm(3) vs. 44.94±49.07mm(3); p=0.03), remodelling index (1.5±0.27 vs. 1.08±0.38; p=0.0001). Comparing culprit lesion characteristics of ACS patients in the two age groups, positive remodelling (95.8% vs. 70.5%, p=0.02), spotty calcification (50% vs. 11.7%, p=0.01) and non-calcified plaque (95.8% vs. 70.5%, p=0.02) were significantly more frequent in patients ≤40years.
3:::33 patients were randomized to treatment with a standard gauze dressing and 33 patients were randomized to the iNPWT cohort. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with respect to patient demographics, clinical, or surgery characteristics. Overall, seven patients (10.6%) were diagnosed with infections; two patients (6.1%) in the placebo group and 5 (15.2%) in the treatment group.
3:::8939 patients survived to discharge with an ACS diagnosis. Of these, 6294 (70.4%) patients were discharged on DAPT, 2154 (24.1%) on SAPT and 491 (5.5%) on no antiplatelet agent. Independent predictors of DAPT non-prescription in the overall cohort were: in-hospital CABG (OR 0.09, 95%CI 0.05-0.14), discharge with warfarin (0.10 (0.07-0.14)), in hospital major bleeding (0.48 (0.34-0.67), diagnosis of unstable angina (0.35, (0.27-0.45)), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (0.67 (0.57-0.78)) [both vs. ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction], in hospital atrial arrhythmia (0.72 (0.60-0.86)), history of hypertension (0.83 (0.73-0.94)) and GRACE high risk (0.83 (0.71-0.98)). There was an increase in prescription of DAPT and a shift towards ticagrelor over clopidogrel for ACS from 2013 to 2016 (p<0.0001), but no overall change in the frequency of DAPT prescription over the entire study period.
3:::The updated meta-analysis of 10 studies showed 3.6 mmHg (p = .45) and 1.0 mmHg (p = .54) reductions in office and in 24-hour systolic BP, respectively. Meta-analysis of 24-hour systolic BP in the 3 sham-controlled studies showed a reduction of 2.18 mmHg (95% confidence intervals (CIs) -4.70 to 0.33 mmHg, n = 396 vs. 230, p = .07). For the 7 no sham controlled studies there was no difference in 24-hour systolic BP (+0.38 mmHg; 95% CIs -5.29 to 6.04 mmHg, n = 215 vs. 245, p = .90). The test for sub-group heterogeneity showed no significant interaction (p = .69). Removing one trial at a time produced confirmatory results.
3:::314 patients referred with a radiographically stable Weber B ankle fracture were identified. Follow up was complete for 98.4% (309/314) of patients. The union rate was 99.4% (307/309) in patients where follow up was completed. 3.5% (11/309) of patients were underwent acute surgical intervention. Of these patients, 6 were identified as having an unstable injury on weight bearing radiographs at 2 weeks and underwent ORIF, 4 were identified as having an unstable injury on EUA and underwent ORIF and 1 had an EUA with no fixation. 2 patients required ORIF for radiographically confirmed non-union. A cost saving analysis comparing the traditional fracture clinic model and VFC model revealed a saving of £237 per patient (32% reduction) with a VFC model. This represents an estimated saving of almost £40,000 per year for the management of this injury alone in our institution.
3:::The percent difference between the mBC and eBC calculated based on the SUVmax was -5.2 ± 21.1% for the blood, -9.4 ± 22.3% for the brain, 1.6 ± 21.3% for the liver, -14.3 ± 16.8% for the spleen, -9.5 ± 27.5% for the pancreas, and 3.4 ± 43.2% for the tumor. Relatively large underestimation was observed for the lung (-48.4 ± 16.2%), small intestine (-37.8 ± 19.3%) and large intestine (-33.9 ± 11.0%), due to the partial volume effect arising from the air or feces contained in these organs. In contrast, relatively large overestimation was observed for the kidney (34.3 ± 29.3%), due to the influence of the high uptake in urine.
3:::During the period 2008-2013, 390 cardiologists from 63 hospitals and 163 surgeons from 41 centres were evaluated. The RAMRs during 2008-2010 correlated with the RAMRs during 2011-2013 for valve surgery within providers (rho=0.55;p<0.001) and within interventionists for PCI (rho=0.21;p<0.001), isolated CABG (rho=0.25;p=0.009), and any valve surgery or CABG procedure (rho=0.49;p<0.001). The most recent hospitals RAMRs (year 2012 and 2013) significantly correlated in PCI (rho=0.40;p=0.002) but not in CABG (rho=0.13;p=0.413). <2% of mortality variations was attributed to providers and 2-3% to difference between operators.'
3:::The prevalence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 was, respectively, 28% and 12.6% (maternal side) and 29.9% and 8.3% (fetal side). All HSV-positive women were asymptomatic. Sexual behavior, vaginal delivery, and presence of HSVs on one side of the placenta were risk factors associated with HSV infection.
3:::The average total vascular experience reported by VSRs was 1446.0 compared with 1421.8 for VSFs (P = .2086). VSRs performed 694.7 major vascular procedures on average compared with 616.3 major cases for VSFs (P = .0106). Highlighted comparisons include the following: open aortic aneurysm cases, VSRs 20.6 and VSFs 22.2 (P = .320); endovascular aortic aneurysm cases, VSRs 80.0 and VSFs 80.6 (P = .945); cerebrovascular cases, VSRs 78.8 and VSFs 85.0 (P = .1132); and peripheral obstructive cases, VSRs 343.6 and VSFs 293.4 (P = .0032).
3:::Between July 2012 and June 2015, a total of 22 unruptured middle cerebral artery or basilar tip aneurysms were treated with a WEB device in our department. Three patients were excluded from the analysis and the mean follow-up period was 17months. Eleven WEBs presented ""compression"" during follow-up. Interestingly, device ""compression"" was statistically correlated to the CFD inflow ratio (P=0.018), although not to aneurysm volume, aspect ratio or neck size.
3:::Thirty patients with AAIS were included and Thrombus-T2* relaxation time was obtained in all patients. Earlier TICI 2b/3 recanalization were obtained in 22 patients (73%) and was significantly associated with SVS+ (1/8 vs. 16/22, P=0.01) and a shorter Thombus-T2* relaxation time (mean SD, range: 257, 18-50ms vs. 45 9, 35-60ms, P<0.001).
3:::Pythons had the highest number of cases (81.3%) followed by anaconda (14.8%) and boa (3.7%). Mixed infection accounted for 81.5% in all snakes and was highest in pythons (63%). However, single infection was only observed in pythons (18.5%). A total of 82.7%, 95.4% and 100% of the bacterial isolates from python, anaconda and boa, respectively were gram negative. Aeromonas spp was the most frequently isolated bacteria in pythons and anaconda with incidences of 25 (18%) and 8 (36.6%) with no difference (p > 0.05) in incidence, respectively, while Salmonella spp was the most frequently isolated in boa and significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in python and anaconda. Bacteria species were most frequently isolated from the kidney of pythons 35 (25.2%), intestines of anacondas 11 (50%) and stomach of boa 3 (30%).
3:::In H. pylori/CagA(+)-infected GES-1 and SGC-7901 cells, the methylation levels of genomic DNA decreased by 49.4% and 18.8%, and in GES-1 and SGC-7901 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1cagA, the methylation levels of genomic DNA decreased by 17.05% and 25.6%, respectively. Among 24 methylation sites detected in the gastrin promoter region, the methylation levels of 9 CpG sites were significantly decreased in H. pylori/CagA+-infected and pcDNA3.1 cagA-transfected cells in comparison to corresponding control cells.
3:::Routine angiography revealed that 45 of 131 patients (34.3%) had RCA-ISR, which were classifiable by occlusion type into ostial (24 cases), proximal (17 cases), diffuse (3 cases), and total (1 case). By multivariable analysis, early generation DES was the only independent predictor of overall ISR (aOR, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.59-7.87; p=0.002). In a subgroup analysis of each focal ISR pattern, early generation DES (aOR, 7.76; 95% CI, 2.15-28.0; p=0.002) was associated with increased risk of ostial ISR. On the contrary, larger stent (aOR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05-0.84; p=0.027) was associated with decreased risk of ostial ISR. Furthermore, a ratio of the stent to post-balloon size >1.10 (aOR, 3.93; 95% CI, 1.30-11.8; p=0.002) and good left ventricular contractility (ejection fraction >60%) (aOR, 8.27; 95% CI, 1.76-39.0; p=0.008) were associated with increased risk of proximal ISR when stent fracture was observed.
3:::We observed a significant decrease in serum concentrations of IL-8 (-12.53%; q=2.00e-03), CCL22 (-7.28%; q=4.00e-04), CCL11 (-7.15%; q=9.48e-02), CRP (-7.06%; q=4.68e-05), and CXCL10 (-13.03%; q=6.34e-14) and a significant increase in IL-1RA (20.16%; q=4.18e-06) from before to after swimming. Associations with quantitative measurements of DBPs or physical activity were similar in direction and strength. Most of the observed associations became non-significant when we adjusted the effects of exposure to DBPs for physical activity or vice-versa.
3:::Six studies between 1996 and 2016 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The reported perfusion defects in these studies were seen in the apical and anterolateral aspects of the left ventricle. Three studies show correlation between the percent of the left ventricle within the RT-field and percent of patients with early perfusion defects on cardiac SPECT. In two studies that used cardiac sparing techniques (such as deep inspiration), that resulted in a low mean heart dose, no perfusion defects were noted.
3:::The sex ratio M/F was 46/34. The median age was 59 (6-86) years. The primary sites were the sacrum (50, 62.5%), mobile spine (12, 15.0%), and skull base (18, 22.5%). Metastases were present in 28 patients (36.0%). The first line of MTTs consisted of imatinib (62, 77.5%), sorafenib (11, 13.7%), erlotinib (5, 6.3%), sunitinib (1, 1.2%) and temsirolimus (1, 1.2%). The reported responses were: partial response (5, 6.3%), stable disease (58, 72.5%), or progressive disease (10, 12.5%). Symptomatic improvement was seen in 28/66 assessable patients (42.4%) and was associated with an objective response occurrence (p = 0.005), imatinib (p = 0.020) or erlotinib use (p = 0.028). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.4°months (95% CI, [6.8-16.1]). Two independent factors of poor prognosis for PFS were identified: a skull-based primary location (HR = 2.5, p = 0.019), and the interval between diagnosis and MTT of <52months (HR = 2.8, p < 0.001). The median overall survival (OS) was 4.4°years (95% CI, [3.8-5.6]). Four independent factors of poor prognosis for OS were identified: the presence of liver metastases (HR = 13.2, p < 0.001), pain requiring opioids (HR = 2.9, p = 0.012), skull-based primary location (HR = 19.7, p < 0.001), and prior radiotherapy (photon alone) (HR = 2.5, p = 0.024). The PFS and OS did not significantly differ between the MTT.
3:::Blood loss, operating time, and hospitalization duration were less (all P < 0.001) in the ASIF/TPS group compared with the ORIF group. The clinical and radiological outcomes of the ASIF/TPS group after a mean follow-up of 6 months were excellent and good in 80.8%, and moderate in 19.2%. In comparison, the results of the ORIF group were excellent and good in 65.4%, moderate in 29.0%, and poor in 5.6%. No patient experienced nonunion, delayed union, superficial infection, or deep surgical wound infection. No urethral injury or dysuria occurred in the ASIF/TPS group. Two patients had temporary lateral femoral cutaneous nerve numbness after operation. There were two superficial wound infections in the ORIF group.
3:::There were a total of 20 (4%) AE during a median follow-up of 3.6 years (9 deaths, 5 MI and 6 UA). The CTA risk score was divided into tertiles: 0-6.7, 6.8-14.8 and > 14.8, respectively. All MI (n = 5) and most of the other AE occurred in the highest risk score tertile (3 vs. 3 vs. 14, p = 0.002). After correction for age and gender, the CTA risk score remained independently associated with AE.
3:::A one standard deviation increase in caloric density of food tweets was related to higher all-cause mortality (+46.50 per 100,000), diabetes (+0.75%), obesity (+1.78%), high cholesterol (+1.40%), and fair/poor self-rated health (2.01%). More burger Yelp listings were related to higher prevalence of diabetes (+0.55%), obesity (1.35%), and fair/poor self-rated health (1.12%). More alcohol tweets and Yelp bars and pub listings were related to higher state-level binge drinking and heavy drinking, but lower mortality and lower percent reporting fair/poor self-rated health. Supplemental analyses with county-level social media indicators and county health outcomes resulted in finding similar but slightly attenuated associations compared to those found at the state level.
3:::Symptomatic LC was seen in 7% of men, and among those, infected LC was seen in 42%. Infected LC cultures showed predominance of G+ cocci such as S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, S. pyogenes, S. fecalis and S. viridans. Monomicrobial infection was seen in 85%. Multivariate logistic regression showed leukocytosis [Odds: 12.3, p = 0.03, 95% CI (1.2-125)] was significant predictor for culture positivity, whereas trend toward significance for factors such CT findings of thickened walls around the LC +/- air.
3:::Six articles were included in the final analysis. All case groups were composed of early full weight-bearing within 2 weeks. All control groups were composed of late full weight-bearing between 6 weeks and 2 months. Pooled analysis was possible for the improvement in Lysholm score, but there was no statistically significant difference shown between groups. Other clinical results were also similar between groups. Four studies reported mechanical femorotibial angle (mFTA) and this result showed no statistically significant difference between groups in the pooled analysis. Furthermore, early weight-bearing showed more favorable results in some radiologic results (osseointegration and patellar height) and complications (thrombophlebitis and recurrence).
3:::Twenty-three patients were recruited, and all planned dose levels were applied. During the actual trial period of 4 ± 1 weeks, three patients experienced six DL-AEs altogether (leucopenia, neutropenia, asthenia, anemia) possibly related to ART (not exceeding 33% in any dose level).
3:::Analyses indicated that families participating in the intervention reported high program satisfaction. Relative to comparison group outcomes, the intervention was associated with medium-to-large effects for child emotion regulation, self-esteem, and anxiety. Medium-sized improvements in disruptive behavior were observed for both groups. Medium and large effects were seen for important caregiver outcomes: knowledge of FASD and advocacy, attributions of behavior, use of antecedent strategies, parenting efficacy, family needs met, social support, and self-care.
3:::Mechanical stimulus induced ACKR2 production in periodontium. The expression of ACKR2 in vitro was mostly detected in mature osteoclasts and early-differentiated osteoblasts. Although ACKR2(-/-) mice exhibited regular phenotype in maxillary bone, the amount of OTM, osteoclasts counts and the expression of pro-resorptive markers were increased in this group. In contrast, the number of osteoblasts and related markers were decreased. OTM resulted in augmented expression of CC chemokines and receptors CCR5 and CCR1 in periodontium, which was higher in ACKR2(-/-) than WT mice. In vitro experiments demonstrated an augmented formation of osteoclasts and diminished differentiation of osteoblasts in ACKR2(-/-) mice.
3:::PM2.5-induced cell damage of HCECs occurred in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Decreased cell viability and proliferation as well as increased apoptosis were observed in HCECs after PM2.5 exposure for 24 h. Autophagy in HCECs was slightly inhibited in the early stage (before 4 h) of exposure but significantly activated in the late stage (after 24 h), as evidenced by a decrease in the former and increase in the latter of the expression of the autophagy-associated markers LC3B, ATG5, and BECN1. Interestingly, rapamycin, an autophagy activator, attenuated early-stage but aggravated late-stage PM2.5-induced cell damage, suggesting that the role of autophagy in HCECs may change over time during PM2.5 exposure. In addition, in the early stage, the expression of LC3B and ATG5 increased in cells co-treated with rapamycin and PM2.5 compared to rapamycin-only or PM2.5-only treated cells, suggesting that autophagy may benefit cell viability after PM2.5 exposure.
3:::In a Cox proportional hazard model, for every 1 FFI unit increase, participants had a 14% reduced hazard of Alzheimer-specific death (HR=0.86; 95% CI: 0.83-0.90; P<0.001). When including diabetes and hypertension (via physician-diagnosis) as covariates, results were unchanged (HR=0.87; 95% CI: 0.82-0.91; P<0.001). Results were also unchanged when restricting the sample to those 50+years (HR=0.92; 95% CI: 0.88-0.97; P=0.005) or stratifying by men (HR=0.85; 95% CI: 0.81-0.91; P<0.001) or women (HR=0.86; 95% CI: 0.79-0.94; P=0.002).
3:::In our patients, total prevalence of tremor was 24.7% for head, 12.4% for voice and 7.1% for the combination of head and voice. Logistic regression analyses showed that female gender is strongly associated with head tremor, which was confirmed by an additional meta-analysis. Severe hand tremor was the only factor associated with voice tremor. Both female gender and severe hand tremor increase the odds for having the combination of head and voice tremor. For males, hand tremor severity is significantly increased among those with head and voice tremor alone and in combination, but for females only for the combination. Patients with both head and voice tremor have more frequent involvement of legs and other localizations and are less responsive to β-blockers.
3:::Sufficient sweat was collected in 159/260 of four-day olds (61%), and in 225/239 of four-week olds (94%). Mean (sd) test duration was 27 (5) and 25 (5) min. Mean (sd, range) conductivity was 53mmol/l (16, 8-114) at age four days, and 36 (9, 12-64) at four weeks.
3:::The mean values of the surface areas changes from T = 1 to T = 12 M were 83.3 ± 11.5% for group CR and 77.1 ± 13.1% for group M4M, respectively. (Mann-Whitney test p < 0.05, p = 0.046). The mean marginal depth at T = 12 M for group CR were 141.2 ± 125.5 μm and 132.1 ± 107.8 μm for the group M4M, respectively. (Mann-Whitney test p > 0.05, p = 0.58). The mean values of the angle formed at the margin (T = 12 M) were for group CR 39.5 ± 19.4° and 28.2 ± 17.2° for group M4M, respectively (Mann-Whitney test p < 0.0001). The photographical analysis by VAS values showed no significant difference between CR and M4M groups (Mann-Whitney test p > 0.05, p = 0.848).
3:::Median (interquartile range) follow-up time was 2.8 (2.4-3.8)years. The cumulative incidence proportions of the primary endpoint at 1 and 3years were 6.4% and 11.5% in high-GRS patients vs. 2.5% and 7.3% in low-GRS patients. The corresponding relative risks were 2.56 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-5.07), and 1.57 (95% CI 1.02-2.44). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of the primary endpoint was 1.50 (95% CI 1.00-2.25). The most pronounced effect of a high GRS was observed on coronary revascularisations (adjusted HR 2.10 [95% CI 1.08-4.07]). Risks of cardiovascular death (adjusted HR 1.07 [95% CI 0.46-2.48]) and all-cause death (adjusted HR 1.15 [95% CI 0.65-2.03]) were unaffected.
3:::While DDT levels have generally decreased during the monitored period, reaching quite stable levels, PCB concentrations were variable, with values exceeding, in some cases, the European Union limit for human consumption and enabling potential carcinogenic effects. However, typical local processing of this fish species markedly appeared to decrease these contaminant levels, thus making the fish product (called missoltino) a safer food.
3:::Thirty-four patients with migraine (6 males, 28 females, average 36 years old) were included. Migraineurs performed worse in the majority of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (p = 0.007) compared to the healthy subjects, significantly in language (p = 0.005), memory (p = 0.006), executive functions (p = 0.042), calculation (p = 0.018) and orientation (p = 0.012). Migraineurs had a lower score on the memory trial of the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test (ROCF) (p = 0.012). The P3 latency in Fz, Cz, Pz was prolonged in migraineurs compared with the normal control group (P < 0.001). In addition, we analyzed significant correlations between MoCA score and the duration of migraine. We also observed that a decrease in the MoCA-executive functions and calculation score and in the ROCF-recall score were both correlated to the frequency of migraine. Migraineurs were more anxious than healthy subjects (p = 0.001), which is independent of cognitive testing. Differences were unrelated to age, gender and literacy.
3:::Sixty-nine trials were included, evaluating 72 interventions which differed markedly in terms of exercise components. Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation was effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.86), total mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.99) and myocardial infarction (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.92). This effect generally demonstrated no significant differences across subgroups of patients who received various types of usual care, more or less than 150 min of exercise per week and of differing cardiac aetiologies. There was however some heterogeneity observed in the efficacy of cardiac rehabilitation in reducing total mortality based on the presence of lipid lowering therapy (I (2) = 48%, p = 0.15 for subgroup treatment interaction effect). No single exercise component was identified through meta-regression as a significant predictor of mortality outcomes, although reductions in both total (RR 0.81, p = 0.042) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.72, p = 0.045) were observed in trials which reported high levels of participant exercise adherence, versus those which reported lower levels. A dose-response relationship was found between an increasing exercise session time and increasing risk of myocardial infarction (RR 1.01, p = 0.011) and the highest intensity of exercise prescribed and an increasing risk of percutaneous coronary intervention (RR 1.05, p = 0.047).
3:::25(OH)D increased by a median (IQR) of 14.40 (20.13)nmol/L (p<0.001) from winter to summer and was accompanied by significant improvements in indices of insulin sensitivity, McAuleys index (p=0.019) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (p=0.028). PBMC mitochondrial parameters basal respiration, non-mitochondrial respiration, ATP production, proton leak, and maximal respiration decreased in summer compared to winter. Similarly, PBMC glycolytic parameters glycolytic activity, glucose response, and glycolytic capacity were all reduced in summer compared to winter. There was also a trend for absolute resting metabolic rate (RMR) to decrease (p=0.066). Markers of systemic inflammation MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12p70 decreased significantly in summer compared to winter. Participants who entered winter with a low 25(OH)D (<50nmol/L), had the greatest alteration in bioenergetic parameters in summer, relative to those with winter 25(OH)D concentrations of 50-75nmol/L or >75nmol/L. The absolute change in 25(OH)D was not associated with altered bioenergetics.'
3:::Few mothers (3%) spontaneously reported pica (for uncommon food and/or non-food substances) at the time of the interview, however, 16 (12.1%) mothers with pica were confirmed after further probing. Twelve (8.6%) children were reported to have ingested/craved clay/soil/dust (11 / 91.7 %), paper (1 / 7.1%) and chalk (1/7.1%) prior to the interview. One child had poly-pica (pica for two substance). Pica was reported to have been practised by expecting mothers during 37 (26.6%) of the pregnancies of the children involved in the study, and was mostly for clay/soil (33 / 89.1%), kola nut (5 / 3.6%), uncooked rice and bambara beans. Childrens pica practices were significantly associated (χ(2)=6.33; p=0.011) with their mothers' pica practices during pregnancy as well as with mothers' pica practices at the time of the study (χ(2)=5.98; p=0.035). A logistic regression analysis seemed to show that pica of the mother during pregnancy was more strongly associated with the child's pica than later pica behaviour of the mother. Many myths and misconceptions associated with the practice of pica were also reported in these communities.'
3:::Over the period 2016-2045, 205,000 cancer cases out of the 2.1 million expected for the 13 cancer sites (9.5%) that have been studied, could be avoided in the Nordic countries by totally eliminating overweight and obesity in the target population. The largest proportional impact was found for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (24%), and the highest absolute impact was observed for colon (44638) and postmenopausal breast cancer (41135).
3:::One in four South Africans reported that they lived in a household where at least one household member had been seriously ill or injured, or where a household member, relative or friend had died within the previous two years. There was a significant association between the serious illness of a household member, or the death of a family member who provided financial assistance, and adult depression scores.
3:::Following treatment 48% (N=42) of the patients showed a significant reduction of misophonia symptoms. Severity of misophonia and the presence of disgust were positive predictors of treatment response.
3:::No association was seen between CBT and the mother smoking or drinking alcohol, coffee, or tea during the index pregnancy. The OR between CBT and paternal smoking in the year before birth (as reported by the mother) was 1.25 (95% CI 1.03, 1.52) with an OR of 1.09 (0.99, 1.19) for every 10 cigarettes per day (CPD) smoked. The association between paternal smoking and CBT appeared to be stronger in children diagnosed before the age of five years (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.14, 2.02) and for astrocytoma (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.26, 2.74).
3:::The rs149941240 polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of CRC, with ORs of 1.50 (95% CI: 1.15-1.96) by co-dominant model and 1.45 (95% CI: 1.21-1.87) by dominant model in the test set, respectively. Correspondingly, the ORs were 1.48 (95% CI: 1.19-1.82) and 1.41 (95% CI: 1.15-1.73) in the validation set, respectively. The crossover analysis showed that non-smokers with the variant genotypes in rs149941240 had a significantly increased risk of CRC than those with wild genotype by dominant model in the validation set (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.04-1.96). However, no gene-environment multiplicative interactions of rs149941240 with tobacco smoking were found on risk of CRC.
3:::The annual prevalence of major depression was higher in daily (11.0%) than in never smokers (4.4%). The prevalence in former daily smokers was 5.1%. The prevalence of MDE and distress was elevated in those recently quitting but returned to baseline levels within one year.
3:::A total of 1577 hemorrhagic stroke cases were observed between 2004 and 2009, among which, 1058 were hypertensive and 519 were non-hypertensive. We found an approximately linear relationship between ambient temperature and hemorrhagic stroke. Each 1°C decrease in the current days temperature was associated with 1.63% (95% CI: 0.33%, 2.95%) increase in daily hemorrhagic stroke. The stratified analyses observed that the association was significant among hypertensive hemorrhagic stroke, each 1°C decrease in the current day's temperature was associated with 2.26% (95% CI: 0.57%, 3.98%) increase in daily hypertensive hemorrhagic stroke. While no significant effect was observed for non-hypertensive hemorrhagic stroke.'
3:::Anhedonia, as measured by the SHAPS, was associated with suicidal thoughts independent of depressive symptoms both before and after ketamine administration. One day post-ketamine administration, improvements on the SHAPS accounted for an additional 13% of the variance in suicidal thought reduction, beyond the influence of depressive symptoms. The BDI anhedonia subscale was not significantly associated with suicidal thoughts after adjusting for depressive symptoms.
3:::A total of 725 patients were analyzed. At least one IAI episode occurred in 137 patients (19%). After adjustment for shock and sepsis status at admission, CD74 and IL10 levels were found to be significantly associated with IAI occurrence [subdistribution hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.67 (0.46-0.97) for CD74 D3/D1 expression ratio and 2.21 (1.63-3.00) for IL10 at D3]. IAI cumulative incidence was significantly different between groups stratified according to CD74 or IL10 expression (Gray tests p < 0.001).
3:::Results indicated that both higher levels of mindfulness and using more PBS predicted decreased alcohol-related consequences and consumption, with PBS mediating both relationships (p<0.01). Those with higher levels of mindfulness were more likely to use PBS, with individuals using more PBS experiencing fewer alcohol-related consequences and consuming fewer drinks per week. Mindfulness moderated the relationship between PBS and consequences, with a significantly stronger negative relationship for those with lower levels of mindfulness.
3:::Rumination was associated with having generated fewer solutions during APS and with a failure to recruit the angular gyrus (AG) and the medial frontal gyrus (MFG) during APS. Rumination was associated with greater MFG activation during NSP and stronger connectivity between the AG and the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) during APS relative to NSP. Findings were not driven by clinical status.
3:::AVR was not significantly different between groups (Cohens d=0.18, p=0.103). Higher diastolic blood pressure (BP) was associated with lower (worse) AVR in BD (r=-0.441, p=0.015) but not HC (r=-0.192, p=0.293). Similarly, in the BD group only, higher (better) endothelial function was associated with higher AVR (r=0.375, p=0.041). Hierarchical regression models confirmed that, independent of covariates, retinal vascular caliber was significantly associated with diastolic BP and endothelial function in BD. Within the BD group, mood scores were significantly negatively correlated with AVR (β=-0.451, p=0.044).'
3:::Before cochlear implantation, the average speech recognition of the ear fitted with a hearing aid was 74%. Cochlear implantation eventually resulted in an average speech recognition of 75%. Bimodal stimulation yielded speech recognition scores of 82, 86, and 88% after 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. At all time intervals, bimodal stimulation resulted in a significantly better speech recognition as compared with stimulation with only hearing aid or only cochlear implant (CI). Speech recognition in noise and spatial speech recognition significantly improved as well as the ability to localize sounds and the quality of life.
3:::rTMS of the left and bilateral TPJ areas resulted in a weaker network contribution of the left supramarginal gyrus to the bilateral fronto-temporal network. Left-sided rTMS resulted in stronger network contributions of the right superior temporal gyrus to the auditory-sensorimotor network, right inferior gyrus to the left fronto-parietal network, and left middle frontal gyrus to the default mode network. Bilateral rTMS was associated with a predominant inhibitory effect on network contribution. Sham stimulation showed different patterns of change compared to active rTMS.
3:::At post- assessment, compared to children in the WLC condition, children in the NET condition demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in number of anxiety diagnoses, clinical severity of diagnosis, and self and parent reported anxiety symptoms, as well as significantly greater increases in overall functioning. However, loss of primary diagnosis in this sample was lower than in previous studies.
3:::Compared with the placebo group, liraglutide-treated patients had increases in serum lipase and amylase of 28.0% and 7.0%, respectively. Levels were increased at 6 months and then remained stable. During the study, 18 (0.4% [1.1 events/1,000 patient-years of observation] [PYO]) liraglutide-treated and 23 (0.5% [1.7 events/1,000 PYO]) placebo patients had acute pancreatitis confirmed by adjudication. Most acute pancreatitis cases occurred ≥12 months after randomization. Liraglutide-treated patients with prior history of pancreatitis (n = 147) were not more likely to develop acute pancreatitis than similar patients in the placebo group (n = 120). Elevations of amylase and lipase levels did not predict future risk of acute pancreatitis (positive predictive value <1.0%) in patients treated with liraglutide.
3:::Both D-dimer and thrombin generation parameters were associated with several traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Lag-time, time-to-peak, peak height, and Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP), as well as D-dimer levels, were higher in CAD patients than in CAD-free subjects. After adjustment for all the traditional risk factors, only ETP levels remained significantly associated with CAD (the highest versus the lowest tertile: OR 2.61 with 95%CI 1.14-5.99), but without improvement of C-statistic. The association of D-dimer vanished after adjustment for inflammatory markers. No difference of either D-dimer or thrombin generation parameters was found between CAD patients with or without previous MI history.
3:::Caucasians reported drinking significantly more alcohol and holding stronger positive expectancies. Bootstrapping mediational analysis with 95% confidence intervals indicated that positive but not negative expectancy effects mediated the relationship between race and past-6-month drinking.
3:::Surveillance of interval and baseline diagnoses for 18 severe dysplasia (SD) cases later detected were: 13, 23, 39, and 44 months since a diagnosis of chronic inflammation in four cases; 6, 6, 6, 11, 13, 16, 16, and 23 months since mild dysplasia (mD) diagnoses in eight; and 6, 9, 10, 13, 18, and 48 months since moderate dysplasia (MD) diagnoses in six. Rates for 11 carcinoma in situ (Cis) cases later detected were: 7 and 18 months since basal cell hyperplasia (Bch) diagnoses in two; and 6, 6, 9, 13, 13, 18, 35, 44, and 50 months since MD diagnoses in nine. In 10 cancer cases later detected, rates were: 6, 6, 7, 18, 19, 34, 36, and 48 months since SD diagnoses in eight cases with submucosal carcinoma; 46 months since MD diagnosis in a T 2 N 0 M 0 carcinoma case; and 52 months since Bch diagnosis in another T 2 N 0 M 0 case.
3:::There was no treatment-emergent suicidal ideation, psychotomimetic or dissociative symptoms. Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score was reduced from baseline to the 10-week primary outcome (mean change: -13.0±11.5, t19=5.0, p<0.001), as was QIDS-SR score (mean change: -5.9±6.6, t19=4.0, p<0.001). The response and remission rates in the ITT sample were 45% and 35%, respectively.
3:::More than 250 compounds have been isolated and identified from Premna species, comprising of diterpenoids, iridoid glycosides, and flavonoids as the most common secondary metabolites, followed by sesquiterpenes, lignans, phenylethanoids, megastigmanes, glyceroglycolipids, and ceramides. Many in vitro and in vivo studies have been conducted to evaluate the biological and pharmacological properties of the extracts, and isolated compounds of Premna species with antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antihyperglycaemia, and cytotoxic activities.
3:::44,814 patients from 474 hospitals in 27 countries were available for analysis. Death was more frequent amongst patients admitted directly to critical care after surgery (critical care: 103/4317 patients [2%], standard ward: 99/39,566 patients [0.3%]; adjusted OR 3.01 [2.10-5.21]; p < 0.001). This association may differ with national income (high income countries OR 2.50 vs. low and middle income countries OR 4.68; p = 0.07). At hospital level, there was no association between mortality and critical care admission directly after surgery (p = 0.26), critical care admission to treat complications (p = 0.33), or provision of critical care beds (p = 0.70). Findings of the hospital-level analyses were not affected by national income status. A sensitivity analysis including only high-risk patients yielded similar findings.
3:::Plasma GlnB22-insulin concentrations were 1.5 times higher than wild-type insulin at all time points during the OGTT. The insulin-receptor affinity of GlnB22-insulin was 57% of that of wild-type insulin. Expression of p.R46Q-insulin in INS-1 cells was associated with decreased insulin secretion, but not induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress.
3:::Of the 315 patients evaluated, 69 died during follow-up. Both RV-GLS/PASP and RV-fwLS/PASP were significantly associated with an increased risk of death at univariate (HR: 0.43; 95%CI: 0.34-0.56; p<0.001 and HR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.34-0.57; p<0.001, respectively) and multivariate analysis (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.49-0.89; p: 0.008 and HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.49-0.85; p: 0.002, respectively) after correction for age, NYHA class, mean arterial pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, natremia, glomerular filtration rate and NT-proBNP.
3:::Meta-analysis of the data from 7 treatment arms revealed a significant reduction in serum CRP concentrations following treatment with GLP-1 RAs (WMD -2.14 (mg/dL), 95% CI -3.51, -0.78, P=0.002; I(2) 96.1%). Removal of one study in the meta-analysis did not change the result in the sensitivity analysis (WMD -2.14 (mg/dL), 95% CI -3.51, -0.78, P=0.002; I(2) 96.1%), indicating that our results could not be solely attributed to the effect of a single study. Random effects meta-regression was performed to evaluate the impact of potential moderator on the estimated effect size. Changes in serum CRP concentration were associated with the duration of treatment (slope -0.097, 95% CI -0.158, -0.042, P<0.001).
3:::A total of 42,481 EDVDBs were collected, with daily cases ranged from 15 to 71. The association between temperature and EDVDBs was U-shaped, with extreme cold temperature showing a weaker, delayed and shorter effect on the risk of dog bites while the effect of extreme hot temperature being stronger, more immediate and lasting longer. Cold temperature had a greater impact on female whereas male was more sensitive to hot temperature. The temperature-EDVDB association was unapparent in the 15-21years group. The cold effect was only significant in the 0-14years group whereas all age-groups suffered from the similar heat effect except those aged 22-45years. Adjusting other meteorological variables and air pollutants did not change the results.
3:::The hemiparesis and the central facial palsy were fully remitted 3 days after the onset of symptoms, and the dysarthria was remitted 2 days afterwards.
3:::The degree of the acupoint temperature consistently ranged from 34.88°C to 36.14°C. The gross thermograph was concentric, with high degree readings around the heart and low degree readings originating from the feet. The left and right body sides had significant correlation between the degrees of bilateral same name acupoint temperatures of 12 regular meridians (correlation coefficient, 0.367-0.985; p < 0.0001). There was also a significant correlation between the acupoint temperature for the governor vessel and the conception vessel (correlation coefficient, 0.083; p = 0.006).
3:::Women showed variable plasma concentrations of several steroids associated with menstrual cycle phase, menopause and oral contraceptive use. Progesterone was higher in females than males, but most other steroids were higher in males than females and almost all declined with advancing age. Using models that corrected for age and gender, body mass index showed weak negative relationships with corticosterone, 21-deoxycortisol, cortisol, cortisone, testosterone, progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone, but a positive relationship with 18-hydroxycortisol. Hypertensives and normotensives showed negligible differences in plasma concentrations of steroids.
3:::Distress exerted nearly equal direct (ß=-0.291, p=0.002) and indirect (mediated by depression and insomnia) (ß=-0.299, p=0.003) negative effects on QOL. Depression exhibited the largest direct negative effect on QOL. The indirect effects of distress on QOL through depression alone, through insomnia alone, and through an insomnia to depression pathway were all significant (ß=-0.122, p=0.011; ß=-0.102, p=0.002; and ß=-0.075, p<0.001, respectively).
3:::The urine assay detected TFV with greater sensitivity than plasma-based measures and with a window of measurements within 7 days of the last TDF/FTC dose. Based on the urine log-linear clearance after the last dose and its concordance with all detectable plasma levels, a urine TFV concentration > 1000 ng/mL was identified as highly predictive of the presence of TFV in plasma at > 10 ng/mL. The urine assay was able to distinguish high and low adherence patterns within the last 48 h (> 1000 ng/mL versus 10-1000 ng/mL), as well as nonadherence (< 10 ng/mL) extended over at least 1 week prior to measurement.
3:::In total 24 cohort and 4 case-control studies were included after initial screening of 1853 hits. Learning disorders (LD) were reported in 21.4-26% of SLE offspring, exceeding the prevalence in the general population. Four studies reported that dyslexia and reading problems were present in 14.3-21.6% of lupus offspring with a clear male predominance. Furthermore, a twofold increased rate of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (n=1 study) and a two- to threefold increased risk for speech disorders (n=3 studies) were reported in lupus offspring compared to controls, although the latter was not statistically significant. More divergent results were found for attention deficit (n=5 studies) and behavior disorders (n=3 studies). In two large controlled studies attention disorders were more prevalent and a trend towards more behavior disorders was reported in 2 of 3 studies analyzing this subject. Finally, IQ and motor skills were not affected in respectively 7 and 5 studies. Cardiopulmonary functioning and mood disorders were scarcely investigated (both n=1). Maternal anti-SSA antibodies were associated with LD in offspring in one study. Other SLE-related antibodies were rarely studied.
3:::Four patients withdrew from the study. The total number of patients in this analysis was 31. The resection rate was 64.5%. The pathologic complete response rate was 15%. The overall median survival was 19.3 months. The 5-year overall survival rate was 37.8%. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 31.1%. The 5-year distant metastasis failure-free survival rate was 40.7% (50.56% for patients with operation; 27.2% for patients without operation, p=0.0298). The acute toxicities were mild, and no Grade 3 or above hematologic toxicity was noted. There was only one patient with Grade 3 esophagus toxicity. Grade 3 lung toxicity occurred in only three patients.
3:::Participants with PTSD demonstrated a slower decrease in overall SCR responses during extinction and greater negative appraisals compared to the group. A moderation analysis revealed that both negative trauma-relevant appraisals and fear extinction learning were independently associated with PTSD symptoms, but there was no moderation interaction.
3:::Of the 16 101 people included, 4519 had a first viral rebound over 58 038 person-years (7·8 per 100 person-years, 95% CI 7·6-8·0). Of the 4519 viral rebounds, 3105 (69%) were defined by measurement of a single viral load of more than 200 copies per mL, and 1414 (31%) by a documented treatment interruption. The rate of first viral rebound declined substantially over time until 7 years from baseline. The other factors associated with viral rebound were current age at follow-up and calendar year at ART initiation (p<0·0001) and HIV risk group (p<0·0001); higher pre-ART CD4 count (p=0·0008) and pre-ART viral load (p=0·0003) were associated with viral rebound in the multivariate analysis only. For 1322 (29%) of the 3105 people with observed viral rebound, the next viral load value after rebound was 50 copies per mL or less with no regimen change. For HIV-positive men who have sex with men, our estimates suggest that the probability of first viral rebound reaches a plateau of 1·4% per year after 45 years of age, and 1·0% when accounting for the fact that 29% of viral rebounds are temporary elevations.
3:::Elderly patients had a higher risk for postoperative cardiac toxicities (UVA: odds ratio [OR] 2.2, P<.001; MVA: OR 2.07, P=.004) and pulmonary toxicities (UVA: OR 2.0, P<.001; MVA: OR 2.03, P<.001) and a higher 90-day postoperative mortality (5.4% vs 2.2%, P=.049). Of the elderly patients, 6.9% experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome compared with 3.8% of younger patients (P=.11). Cardiac toxicity was linearly associated with age, and the relative risk increased by 61% for every additional decade of age. There was no difference in postoperative gastrointestinal or wound adverse events or in length of hospital stay. Grade 3+ acute toxicities from nCRT were infrequent and were clinically similar regardless of age. Freedom from esophageal cancer and disease-free survival were similar, but overall survival was significantly shorter in the elderly cohort.
3:::There were 36,499,163 births. M/T decreased with increasing sibling order for all races (p<0.0001) except for Asian or Pacific Islander births where M/T rose progressively to 3rd order births (p<0.0001) then fell (p=0.0002). Weighted mean maternal age for each birth order by race order was Asian or Pacific Islander>White Black or African American/American Indian or Alaska Native. The differences between adjacent means were all significant (almost all p<0.0001). The mean maternal age spread followed the same order.
3:::PAR for the Canadian data is sensitive to the model choice, and it varies with a range of 10% for ES and 32% for NS, respectively. There is little difference in results between miners models and dwelling models. PAR values for ES females are greater than those for ES males, except in Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon. The male-female range overlaps. Gaussian kernel estimator produces PAR estimates similar to the commonly used log-normal distribution.'
3:::Thirty-four percent of the patients were good responders, with a total Alda score of 5 or higher. The treatment response rate did not differ between the lithium and valproate groups, but lithium and valproate combination therapy was associated with poorer response. The number of previous mixed episodes was associated with a worse response (p = 0.026). Of individual symptoms, delusions during manic episodes (p = 0.008) and increased appetite (p = 0.035) during depressive episodes were more common in moderate/poor responders than in good responders. Co-morbid anxiety disorders were more frequently observed in the moderate/poor response group (p = 0.008).
3:::Urological anomalies were diagnosed in 95 patients. Dilated vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was the predominant finding (n = 29), including nine who initially had surgery. Using imaging guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics would have missed 11 urological patients, including two with initial surgery, and avoided 339 scintigraphies. Using the European Association of Paediatric Urology guidance would have missed three urological patients, one with initial surgery, and avoided 46 scintigraphies. Investigating patients under two years with ultrasound and scintigraphy, and just ultrasound in children over two years, would have identified all patients initially treated with surgery and avoided 65 scintigraphies.
3:::Patients (mean age 71 ± 5 years, 54% women) with reduced GLS had higher blood pressure and rates of diabetes and obesity (P < .05). LA reservoir strain and conduit strain were lower in the group with impaired GLS (38.2 ± 7.3% vs 39.9 ± 6.4% [P = .004] and 18.7 ± 5.7% vs 20.5 ± 5.1% [P < .001], respectively), but there was no difference in LA pump strain (19.5 ± 5.5% vs 19.3 ± 4.6%, P = .72). GLS was independently associated with LA reservoir and conduit strain (P < .05) but not independently associated with LA pump strain (P = .91). Reduced GCS was associated with a larger body mass index, male sex, and diabetes (P < .05). There were no differences in LA reservoir, conduit, and pump strain in patients with normal and abnormal GCS (P > .05).
3:::Complete Freunds adjuvant-induced nociception increased the mean levels (± SD) of spinal 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (178 ± 34 vs. 100 ± 21; P = 0.0019), ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase-1 (0.52 ± 0.11 vs. 0.36 ± 0.064; P = 0.0088), and ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase-3 (0.61 ± 0.13 vs. 0.39 ± 0.08; P = 0.0083) compared with levels in control mice (n = 6/group). The knockdown of ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase-1 or ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase-3 alleviated thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, whereas overexpression cytosinethem in naïve mice (n = 6/group). Down-regulation of spinal ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase-1 and ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase-3 also reversed the increases in Fos expression (123 ± 26 vs. 294 ± 6; P = 0.0031; and 140 ± 21 vs. 294 ± 60; P = 0.0043, respectively; n = 6/group), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine levels in the Stat3 promoter (75 ± 16.1 vs. 156 ± 28.9; P = 0.0043; and 91 ± 19.1 vs. 156 ± 28.9; P = 0.0066, respectively; n = 5/group), and consequent Stat3 expression (93 ± 19.6 vs. 137 ± 27.5; P = 0.035; and 72 ± 15.2 vs. 137 ± 27.5; P = 0.0028, respectively; n = 5/group) in complete Freund's adjuvant-treated mice.'
3:::There were 4454 CHS participants from 4 clinical sites. In total, 84% were white, 58% were women and their mean age was 72 years at enrollment. Approximately 11% of the cohort was frail. The model had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.75 to concurrently predict a frailty phenotype. This Claims-based Frailty Indicator significantly predicted death (odds ratio, 1.84), time to death (hazards ratio, 1.71), number of hospital admissions (incidence rate ratio, 1.74), and nursing home admission (odds ratio, 1.47) in models adjusted for age and sex.
3:::A two normal components model best fitted the observed distribution of AAO in BD1 (BIC = -1599.3), BD2 (BIC = -2158.4), and in the whole sample (BIC = -3854.9). A higher number of EO BD2 patients had a depression-(hypo)mania-free interval (DMI) course, while a higher rate of (hypo)mania-depression-free interval (MDI) course was found in EO BD1. EO BD2 had also a higher rate of comorbidity with alcohol dependence compared to EO BD1. The latter finding was confirmed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.
3:::The overall incidence of major mishaps and minor mishaps was 11.2 and 18.2 per 100 dives, respectively. Only 8% participants reported written checklist use, 71% reported using memorized checklists, and 21% did not use any checklist. The rate ratio for written checklist use as compared to using a memorized or no checklist was 0.47 (95%CI: 0.27, 0.83) for all mishaps (major and minor combined), and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.93) for major mishaps. The rate of mishaps among memorized checklist users was similar to no checklist users.
3:::Overall, seizure clusters were independently associated with earlier age of seizure onset, symptomatic generalized epilepsy (SGE), central nervous system (CNS) infection, cortical dysplasia, status epilepticus, absence of 1-year seizure freedom, and having failed 2 or more AEDs (P<0.0026). Patients with SGE (27.1%) were more likely to develop seizure clusters than patients with focal epilepsy (16.3%) and IGE (7.4%; all P<0.001). Analysis by epilepsy type showed that absence of 1-year seizure freedom since starting treatment at one of our centers was associated with seizure clustering in patients across all 3 epilepsy types. In patients with SGE, clusters were associated with perinatal/congenital brain injury. In patients with focal epilepsy, clusters were associated with younger age of seizure onset, complex partial seizures, cortical dysplasia, status epilepticus, CNS infection, and having failed 2 or more AEDs. In patients with IGE, clusters were associated with presence of an aura. Only 43.5% of patients with seizure clusters were prescribed rescue medications.
3:::Our final model had excellent model fit (comparative fix index = 0.999, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.998, root mean square error of approximation = 0.008) and showed that mother-child interaction quality mediated the effects of both enhanced nutrition and responsive stimulation interventions on height-for-age at 4 years via its longitudinal stability from 2 years of age (β = 0.016, p = 0.005; β = 0.048, p < 0.001, respectively). Further, diarrhoeal illness mediated the effects of maternal depressive symptoms at 1 year post partum on childrens height-for-age at 4 years via the longitudinal stability of height-for-age z-score from 2 years of age onwards (β = -0.007, p = 0.019).'
3:::At 6 months after DMEK, best-corrected visual acuity in rebubbled eyes did not differ from that in control eyes (P = 0.514). The mean ECD decrease was higher in rebubbled than in control eyes (54% vs. 35%, respectively, P = 0.001). Pachymetry did not differ between both groups (P = 0.153). After rebubbling, one buphthalmic eye showed temporary intraocular pressure elevation and 5 eyes had minor graft edge detachment that did not require further treatment.
3:::One hundred patients were enrolled, 50 in each group. Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurred in 15 patients (30 per cent) receiving placebo versus five (10 per cent) receiving landiolol (P = 0·012). The overall incidence of postoperative complications was significantly lower in the landiolol group (P = 0·046). In the landiolol group, postoperative heart rate was suppressed effectively, but the decrease in BP was not harmful. The interleukin 6 level was significantly lower on days 3 and 5 after surgery in the landiolol group (P = 0·001 and P = 0·002 respectively).
3:::Corneal thickness did not differ between former preterm and full-term infants. Significant differences were found between preterm and full-term infants now aged ≤7 years for spherical equivalent, astigmatism, corneal diameter, and axial length. In preterm infants aged ≥8 years compared with full terms of the same age, we found a significant difference only in the corneal diameter. In multivariable analysis of the corneal diameter, we detected an association with birth weight and perinatal adverse events. Astigmatism correlated with birth weight and laser treatment, anterior chamber depth with birth weight, laser treatment and age at examination, and axial length with birth weight and age at examination.
3:::The PK parameters of tenofovir in the 15 patients were determined as follows (mean ± SD): AUC(0-24 h), 4074.7 ± 1551.9 ng•h/mL; Cmax,ss, 447.1 ± 217.4 ng/mL; Ctrough,ss, 98.7 ± 36.7 ng/mL; tmax,ss, 1.3 ± 0.4 h; plasma t1/2, 21.8 ± 7.6 h; and CLss/F, 45.8 ± 13.0 L/h.
3:::It has been evidenced that positively and negatively singly charged aggregates at low collision energy decompose preferentially by loss of only one DMEB molecule. Increasing the collision energy, the loss of neutrals becomes increasingly abundant. Multiply charged DMEB aggregates are unstable and decompose forming singly charged monomers or dimers. MD simulations show reverse micelle-like structures with polar heads somewhat segregated into the aggregate interior. Finally, a good correlation between experimental and calculated collisional cross sections (CCS) was found.
3:::Of 4051 identified total, 2268 had complete examination of the distal fallopian tube and were age 50 or above. Of these, 1747 were in group 2. Two STICs were identified (0.1%), one associated with a grade 2 endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma and one with a low-grade ovarian serous carcinoma in the setting of a serous borderline tumor.
3:::54,348 discharge cases were identified. ACDF, posterior only, and combined anterior/posterior approach volumes significantly increased from 2001 to 2010 (98.62%, 303.07%, and 576.19%; respectively, p<0.05). However, laminoplasty volume remained unchanged (p>0.05). Total charges for ACDF, posterior only, combined anterior/posterior, and laminoplasty approaches all significantly increased (138.72%, 176.74%, 182.48%, and 144.85%, respectively; p<0.05). For all procedures, overall mortality significantly decreased by 45.34% (p=0.001) and overall morbidity increased by 33.82% (p=0.0002). For all procedures except ACDF, which saw a significantly decrease by 8.75% (p<0.0001), length of hospital stay was unchanged.
3:::Twenty-three patients were included with a mean age of 54.4 years (32-78 years). Patients presented with a shorter step-length of the injured leg compared to the non-injured leg (asymmetry of 11.3%). Analysis of single-support showed shorter support time of the injured leg compared to the non-injured leg (asymmetry of 8.7%). Moreover, analysis of swing-time showed increased swing-time of the injured leg (asymmetry of 8.9%). Compared to a healthy reference population, increased asymmetry in all gait patterns was observed. The association between asymmetry and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) showed moderate associations (single-support: R=0.50, P=0.03; step-length: R=0.43, P=0.07; swing-time: R=0.46, P=0.05).
3:::There were 341 cases eligible for inclusion. CCF >80% was significantly associated with decreased odds of ROSC compared to CCF≤80% (aOR: 0.49, 95%CI: 0.28-0.87). This relationship remained significant whether the first 3min of data was used, the first 5min or all available episode data. Among the group with a downtime >15min, CCF was significantly lower for those who achieved ROSC compared to those who did not (mean (SD): 73.01 (12.99)% vs. 83.05 (9.38)% p=0.002). The adjusted odds ratio for achieving ROSC in this group was significantly less with CCF>80% compared to CCF≤80% (aOR: 0.06, 95%CI: 0.01-0.38).
3:::Of the twenty pigs, one had a breach of protocol and was excluded, leaving nine pigs in the 50% group and ten in the 100% group. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved in six pigs in the 50% group and eight in the 100% group. The rSO2 (p=0.007) was lower with FiO2 50%, but the PbO2 was not (p=0.93). After ROSC there were significant interactions between time and FiO2 regarding both rSO2 (p=0.001) and PbO2 (p=0.004). Compared to the controls, mitochondrial respiration was decreased, with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) levels of 57 (17)pmols(-1)mg(-1) compared to 92 (23)pmols(-1)mg(-1) (p=0.008), but there was no difference between different oxygen fractions (p=0.79).
3:::Even in mildly disabled MS patients, a significant reduction of the corpus callosum (p<0.001) was observed in comparison to healthy controls. Callosal area, index and circularity were significantly (p<0.002) related to whole-brain white matter volume, T2 lesion load and deep grey matter volume, but not with cortical grey matter. The combination of commonly used imaging and clinical parameters explained between 7% (Fatigue) and 50% (processing speed, verbal memory) of the adjusted variance. Inclusion of the mean diffusivity increased the adjusted R(2) significantly to 69% (p=0.004) and 71% (p=0.002) for visuospatial and verbal memory respectively.
3:::In the training dataset, several variables were selected for inclusion, including age, body mass index, and parity, among others. In the testing dataset, the Spearman correlation coefficient between predicted and measured percent MD was 0.61. As the prediction model performed well in the testing dataset, we developed the final model in the total dataset. The final prediction model explained 41% of the variability in percent MD. Both measured and predicted percent MD were similarly associated with breast cancer risk adjusting for age, menopausal status, and hormone use (OR per five unit increase = 1.09 for both).
3:::A total of 31% of infants were intubated in the delivery room in the NIPPV group compared to 85% in the Face mask group (p=<0.001). Chest compression rates were 11% in the NIPPV group and 31% in the Face mask group (p<0.001). Epinephrine administration was also lower in NIPPV group (2% vs. 8%; P=0.03). Only 38% infants remained intubated at 24hours of age in the NIPPV group compared to 66% in the Face mask group (p<0.001). Median duration of invasive ventilation in the NIPPV group was shorter (2days) compared to the Face mask group (11days) (p=0.01). The incidence of air-leaks was not significant between the two groups.
3:::Patients who used CSs had lower rates of edema. In fact, after 4 months, there were no remarkable edema rates. These results suggest that neurosensory disorders resolved after 3 months. In addition, in the early and late periods, administration of CSs did not influence the regression of neurosensory disorders.
3:::Seven SNPs in IGF-I and INS genes were associated with breast cancer risk. These associations differed between non-obese/active and obese/inactive women and between exogenous E non-users and users. The mediation effects of IGF-I/IR traits on the relationship between these SNPs and cancer differed between strata, but only roughly 35% of the cancer risk due to the SNPs was mediated by traits. Similarly, carriers of 20 SNPs in PIK3R1, AKT1/2, and MAPK1 genes (signaling pathways-genetic variants) had different associations with breast cancer between strata, and the proportion of the SNP-cancer relationship explained by traits varied 45-50% between the strata.
3:::For the cortex and the striatum, 2295 and 2282 DEGs were respectively identified between the I/R group and the controls, and were classified into 3 and 2 correlation modules. For each module, a PPI network was constructed, and Toll-like receptor 2 (Tlr2, degree = 25), interleukin 1β (Il1b, degree = 21), and heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1, degree = 17) had high connective degrees. Furthermore, 29 common overlapped DEGs were found across time and tissue, which might be targeted by 13 TFs. Especially, Tlr2, Il1b, and Hmox1 were targeted by myeloblastosis protein (Myb, target count = 16) and FBJ osteosarcoma protein (Fos, target count = 15). Moreover, plasminogen activator urokinase receptor (Plaur) was targeted by Fos, and it was an HCDEG in correlation modules of both cortex and striatum. Upregulation of Tlr2, Il1b, Hmox1, and Plaur in I/R injury was confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining.
3:::Median weight gain in BC survivors was 2.00 kg (p < 0.0001); BMI, glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), and total cholesterol increased modestly but significantly. Waist circumference, glucose, and triglycerides were higher in LTFU BC survivors versus controls. BC survivors had significantly greater prevalence of diabetes/pre-diabetes versus controls (33 vs. 20.4%, AE-adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.59, p = 0.050). This effect was restricted to those with lower levels of physical activity (<56 metabolic equivalent (MET)-hours/week: OR 2.70 versus 0.94 for those with higher physical activity, interaction p = 0.034). At LTFU, BC survivors were more physically active than at diagnosis (median increase 28 MET-hours/week interquartile range -14.8 to 82), and compared to controls (median 68.2 vs. 44 MET-hours/week, p < 0.0001).
3:::The GNRs with serum corona were internalized quickly by cancer cells and finally taken up by lysosomes. The GNRs damaged the lysosomal membrane, resulting in the leakage of cathepsin B, which promoted the activation of receptor-interacting protein 1 and necrosomes formation. Necrotic cells and their debris or ill cellular contents were engulfed by macrophages resulting in high-level release of TNF-α, which further confirmed necrosis.
3:::There was a positive correlation between CFQ domains and SSQ questions. The CFQ showed a positive correlation with peripheral oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (SpO2) and the distance walked in the 6MWT, and a negative correlation with the Borg scale. The SSQ showed positive correlation with the distance walked and a negative correlation with the Borg scale. For some markers evaluated in the 6MWT, there was sometimes association with the evaluated domains and questions. Male patients showed better scores in the emotional CFQ domain, better performance in SSQ and physical performance.
3:::MTA and Biodentine induced the formation of significantly more new mineralized tissue (P < .0001) than gutta-percha, which did not induce the formation of mineralized tissue in any case. Complete sealing of the perforations was more frequent with MTA, which formed mineralized tissue with greater thickness and area. Biodentine and MTA exhibited no bone resorption in the furcation region, fewer inflammatory cells, and greater RUNX2 immunostaining intensity than gutta-percha.
3:::Although information need satisfaction was not significantly different between intervention and control groups, the former reported significantly better depression score on Depression Anxiety Stress Scale comparing to the control group (p<0.01; η(2)=0.09) with a medium effect size. Reduction of anxiety in the intervention group were clinically significant.
3:::The results showed that the combination and application of the Berlin Protocol for Mirror Therapy together with ART was feasible for clinical use. This combination was integrated into the therapeutic plan of subacute stroke patients at the two clinical locations where the second part of this research was conducted.
3:::Ankle fusion was achieved in 100% of patients treated with external fixation and in 88% with internal stabilization. Desired frontal plane alignment was achieved in 100% of patients with external fixation and 76% with internal stabilization. Desired sagittal plane alignment was achieved in 100% of external fixation and 85% of internal stabilization. A total of 14 (48.3%) patients from group 1 showed a radiographic evidence of pre-existing adjacent-joint OA. The radiographic evidence of pre-existing adjacent-joint OA was also found in 27(81.8%) subjects from group 2. Alterations of adjacent joints were also found on postoperative radiograms of 19 (65.5%) patients subjected to Ilizarov fixation and in all 33 patients from group 2.
3:::Extensive soft tissue injuries, including both collateral ligament injuries and muscle origin avulsions from either or both sides, were found in all patients. The functional result at follow-up was satisfactory in all patients.
3:::The 205 OGIs included 80 globe ruptures, 71 PEIs, 48 IOFBs and six perforating injuries. Falls predominated in older age groups compared to the other mechanisms of injury (p<0.0001). A fall was responsible for 33 globe ruptures and 82% of these had a history of previous intraocular surgery. Globe rupture and perforating injuries had poorer visual outcomes (p<0.05), consistent with previous studies. Alcohol was implicated in 20 cases of OGI, with 11 of these due to assault. PEIs and IOFBs commonly occurred while working with metal. BCVA was significantly worse following removal of an intraocular foreign body. We found presenting BCVA to be a good predictor of BCVA at the time of discharge.
3:::Descriptively, rich women had high antenatal attendance and health facility deliveries represented by 96.5% and 95.6% respectively. However, the binary logistic regression results revealed that poor women owning NHIS are 7% (CI = 1.76-2.87) more likely to make at least four antenatal care visits compared to women in the middle wealth quintile (5%, CI = 2.12-4.76) and rich women (2%, CI = 1.14-4.14). Similarly, poor women who owned the NHIS are 14% (CI = 1.42-2.13) likely to deliver in health facility than women in the middle and rich wealth quintile.
3:::Noggin-transfected NSCs significantly decreased the infarct volume and improved the neurological scores. Noggin-transfected NSCs also reduced the percentage of apoptotic neurons and relieved neuronal morphological damage. Noggin-transfected NSC transplantation markedly decreased the MDA levels and increased the SOD activity, and simultaneously downregulated the BMP4 (bone morphogenesis protein), VEGF, and bFGF proteins.
3:::ACD was associated with fewer post-operative seromas (odds ratio [OR] 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06-0.35), less wound dehiscence (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.78), and fewer surgical site infections (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23-0.63). Post-operative pseudoaneurysms were significantly more common in the ACD group (OR 3.83, 95% CI 1.55-9.44). In five of 17 studies, DOS and HLOS were not reduced in the ACD group. When all studies reporting a mean DOS and/or HLOS were compared in a non-parametric analysis, neither was significantly different.
3:::All maxillary first molars showed 3-root configuration, whereas maxillary second molars showed 3-, 2-, and single-root configurations. For maxillary first molars, the most common Vertucci classifications for the mesiobuccal root were type II (2-1, 45.6%), type IV (2-2, 27.27%), and type I (1, 25.45%). For maxillary second molars, the most common Vertucci classifications for the mesiobuccal root were type II (2-1, 47.1%), type I (1, 42.06%), and type IV (2-2, 8.03%). The prevalence of a second mesiobuccal canal is statistically not affected by either sex, tooth position (right or left side), or age.
3:::One-way ANOVA showed significant main effect of group for action binding (p = 0.004, F = 6.27). Post hoc analysis revealed that PD-ICB had significantly stronger action binding than HC (p = 0.004), and PD-no-ICB (p = 0.04). There was no difference between PD-no-ICB and HC. SSRT did not differ between PD groups, whereas a significant difference between PD-no-ICB and HC was detected (p = 0.01). No other differences were found among groups in the other tasks.
3:::For the 458 686 discharges meeting PACR inclusion criteria, in multivariable models, factors associated with higher discharge-level PACR measure included age <1 year, female sex, 1 of 17 CCIs, higher CCI count, Medicaid insurance, higher median household income, and higher percentage of single-parent households. Adjustment for SDH made small but significant improvements in fit and accuracy of discharge-level PACR models, with larger effect at the hospital level, changing decile-rank for 17 of 47 hospitals.
3:::We included data from 5 randomized trials and 4595 patients. At 30days, CABG was associated with higher stroke (OR 2.54 [95% CI, 1.02-6.31]) and periprocedural myocardial infarction (OR 1.45 [95% CI, 1.00-2.10]), with no other significant differences compared to PCI. At 1year, CABG reduced repeat revascularization (OR 0.56 [95% CI, 0.40-0.77]), but increased stroke (OR 5.11 [95% CI, 1.62-16.12]). At 3-5years, CABG reduced repeat revascularization (OR 0.55 [95% CI, 0.45-0.67]) and non-periprocedural myocardial infarction (OR 0.45 [95% CI, 0.29-0.70]), without significant differences on other outcomes.
3:::A total of 512 neonates were admitted to the NICU and enrolled in this study. There were 242 infants who were admitted to the old NICU, and 270 infants in the new facility. During the study period, the rate of infection episodes decreased from 19.0% to 11.1% (P = 0.01). Additionally, the average hospital-acquired infection rate decreased from 6.26 cases per 1000 patient-days to 4.09 cases per 1000 patient-days (P = 0.03). The most common infection site was blood stream infection, which decreased from 8.3% to 3.7% (P = 0.03). The total catheter-related infection rates of the blood stream, lower respiratory tract, and urinary tract decreased from 13.6% to 5.9% (P = 0.003). Klebsiella pneumonia, E. coli, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) were the most frequently found pathogens in the old NICU, whereas MRSA, CoNS, E. faecalis, and A. baumannii were the most frequently found pathogens in the new NICU.
3:::Among the 902 U.S. service members with combat-related burns sustained during the study period, 226 (25.0%) had involvement of the genitalia, perineum, and/or buttocks. Complete PB was associated with a crude risk of mortality (HR: 5.3; 2.9-9.7), but not an adjusted risk (HR=1.8; 0.8-4.0). However, TBSA burned was identified as a potential negative effect modifier. Among patients with burns <60% TBSA, sustaining a complete PB conferred an adjusted risk of death (HR=2.7; 1.1-6.8). Further, patients with a perineal burn had a five-fold increased incidence of bacteremia. In adjusted models, each event of bacteremia increased the risk of mortality by 92% (HR 1.92; 1.39-2.65). Perineal burns were associated with a two-fold increased incidence of severe non-burn related trauma that also doubled mortality risk in adjusted models (HR 2.29; 1.23-4.27).
3:::Forty patients were included in whom the OSA-prevalence was 65%. Kaplan Meier analyses suggest a trend towards earlier closure of synchondrosis in patients with OSA (p = 0.066). The mean SNA was 74.7°. There was a positive effect of age on the SNA (p = 0.020). There was no difference in SNA for patients with an open SOS as compared to patients with a closed SOS after correction for age.
3:::Less than 40% of the patients attained therapeutic trough serum concentrations during the first 3 days of therapy. Patients with augmented renal clearance had lower serum trough concentrations despite receiving higher maintenance doses and more loading doses. When trough serum concentrations were outside of therapeutic range, dose adjustments in accordance to therapeutic drug monitoring were made to less than half.
3:::The mean age of the study cohort was 75.52 ± 5.22 years, the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II score was 11.33% ± 1.28%, and the mean logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation I score was 31.13% ± 9.68%. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation with the J-Valve system was successfully performed in 19 of the 21 patients (90.5%). For patients with aortic stenosis, 12-month follow-up echocardiography demonstrated an increase in mean effective valve area from 0.62 ± 0.17 cm(2) to 1.52 ± 0.35 cm(2) and a decrease in transvalvular mean gradient from 61 ± 15 mm Hg to 18 ± 9 mm Hg. All surviving patients (n = 18) reported improvements in at least 1 of the New York Heart Association classes. The combined ratio of successful implantation and absence of adverse events in our cohort (n = 21) was 76.19%.
3:::So far, between October 2013 and July 2016, we have recruited 1308 participants. In this period, 1308/1486 (88%) patients who were invited for participation in UMBRELLA consented to cohort participation. Of these patients, 1138 (87%) gave broad consent for randomization to future interventions. Return rate for PROs at baseline were 80%, and varied from 67 to 74% during follow-up. Several observational studies-and the first randomized intervention study-are currently ongoing.
3:::The presence or absence of MGMT expression entailed no significant differences in response rate. Median values of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were lower in patients with MGMT expression, but sample size is too small to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference. No significant relationship for response rate and PFS was observed in relation with p53 expression. By contrast, patients with a strong tumor expression of p53 had a significantly lower OS compared to patients with no or weak expression of the protein (p = 0.027). There was a positive correlation between the expression of p53 and MGMT (p = 0.08).
3:::IGHD subjects showed a reduction in sleep efficiency (P = 0.007), total sleep time (P = 0.028), duration of N2 and R in minutes (P = 0.026 and P = 0.046 respectively), but had increased duration and percentage of N1 stage (P = 0.029 and P = 0.022 respectively), wake (P = 0.007) and wake-time after sleep onset (P = 0.017). There was no difference in N3 or in sleep quality questionnaire scores.
3:::Acromegaly patients had greater lung volumes (maximal vital capacity, intra-thoracic gas volume and residual volume: P < 0.001, total lung capacity: P = 0.006) and showed signs of small airway obstruction (reduced maximum expiratory flow when 75% of the forced vital capacity (FVC) has been exhaled: P < 0.001, lesser peak expiratory flow: P = 0.01). There was no significant difference between active and inactive acromegaly. Female patients had significantly altered lung function in terms of subclinical airway obstruction.
3:::This consensus statement was developed to inform the clinical decision-making process when managing the central neck compartment in patients with PTC from the AHNS. This document is intended to provide clarity through definitions as well as a basic guideline from which to manage the central neck. It is our hope that this improves the quality and reduces variation in management of the central neck, facilitates communication, and furthers research for patients with thyroid cancer.
3:::Recent publications have responded to some research questions, but gaps remain and new questions have emerged. Re-framing of several key research questions is needed for travelers from emerging economies.
3:::Anti-CCR3 antibody reduced the number of eosinophils in peripheral blood and intestinal mucosa, but not in bone marrow. This reduction was associated with restoration of reduced villous crypt ratio, increased intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, and weight loss induced by OVA challenge. However, Anti-CCR3 antibody had no effect on the level of OVA specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and the expression of critical chemokines or cytokines in eosinophil trafficking into the GI tract, such as eotaxin-1, interleukin (IL)-5, and IL-13.
3:::The study cohort included 503 patients (594 lesions). From 2010 to 2013 96% of procedures were performed with antegrade wire-escalation technique and 4% performed using retrograde techniques, from 2013-2016 the corresponding numbers were 83% and 17.0%. The procedural success rate was 69%, increasing from 64% before to 72% (p = .06) after routinely using the retrograde approach. No individual patient characteristic, lesion variable or score was strongly associated with procedural success or failure. There were 4% serious procedure related complications. In patients with PCI of a CTO lesion only, 87% were in CCS or NYHA functional class ≥2 before the index procedure vs. 22% at follow-up.
3:::One hundred seven patients underwent free fibula flap reconstruction of the mandible. Nine patients underwent multiple free flaps and were excluded from this study. Of the remaining 98 patients, 8 patients required operative exploration for microvascular compromise. All patients were found to have venous thrombosis. There were 3 total flaps losses with a salvage rate of 62.5% and overall flap survival of 96.9%. The size of the vena comitantes in the compromised flaps were significantly larger than those of the remaining patients (4.4 mm vs 3.1 mm; P < .0001). Although the total operative times were similar between the 2 groups (585.2 minutes vs 563.3 minutes), the ischemia time was significantly shorter in those cases that required operative takeback (76.5 minutes vs 104.0 minutes; P < .04).
3:::The healing time of the tympanic membrane perforation was determined as mean 10.3 ± 2.18 days in the study group applied with PRF and 17 ± 2.40 days in the control group. Higher values in respect of fibrosis and neovascularization were obtained in the study group.
3:::Stapes displacement in the healthy group (average = 3.31 × 10(-5) mm) was significantly greater than that in the impaired group (average = 1.41 × 10(-6) mm) prior to surgery. After surgery, the average displacement in the impaired group was 2.55 × 10(-6) mm, which represented a significant improvement. For the patients who underwent the audiometric test, 10 improved hearing after surgery, and stapes displacement increased in nine of these 10 patients.
3:::As the glucose-lowering rate increased, the survival rate of cardiomyocytes increased in group B and decreased in groups C, D, and E. The TNF-α concentration increased in groups B, C, and D and decreased in group E. After 24 h, the apoptosis rate decreased in group B and increased in groups C, D, and E. The expression of p-ERK1/2 increased in groups B, D, and E, and was the lowest in group C. After adding U0126, the survival rate of cardiomyocyte in all groups increased and TNF-α concentration decreased.
3:::The solid dispersions of piperine with Sor, PEG and PVP exhibited superior performance for the dissolution of piperine with a drug release of 70%, 76% and 89%, respectively after 2 h compared to physical mixtures and pure piperine, which could be due to its transformation from crystalline to amorphous form as well as the attachment of hydrophilic carriers to the surface of poorly water-soluble piperine.
3:::FOX suggested MAP changes in 21 subjects (84%). The within-subject comparison showed a significant median improvement of 10, 3, 1, and 7% at 40, 55, 70, and 85 dB SPL, respectively. All but two subjects showed an instantaneous improvement in their mean speech audiometric score.
3:::A total of 8656 patients with AF initiated a NOAC (3352 apixaban, 1340 dabigatran, 3964 rivaroxaban). Mean age was 77 years, 53% male; 91% collected the first repeat prescription for any NOAC, 70% and 57% collected any NOAC or subsequent warfarin prescription over 12 months and 30 months respectively; 8.9% had switched to warfarin. The proportions switching from apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban to a different NOAC were 14%, 31% and 17% respectively. In a regression model adjusting for age, gender and comorbidity, apixaban-initiated patients over 30 months were 28% more likely to persist with any anticoagulant therapy compared with dabigatran-initiated patients (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.28 [1.16-1.42]) and 15% more likely to persist compared with rivaroxaban-initiated (1.15 [1.06-1.24]). Rivaroxaban-initiated patients were 12% more likely to persist compared with dabigatran-initiated patients (1.12 [1.02-1.24]).
3:::A total of 26,287 adults were included in the analyses. Overall, the weighted CRN rate in the adult population is 19.8% for men and 26.2% for women. There was a clear pattern of differential rates in CRN across socio-economic strata by gender. Overall, men were less likely to report CRN (AOR = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.69-0.79), controlling for other risk factors.
3:::Our index scores performed as well as using all 29 Elixhauser comorbidity variables separately. The c-statistic for our index scores without inclusion of other covariates was 0.777 (95% confidence interval, 0.776-0.778) for the mortality index and 0.634 (95% confidence interval, 0.633-0.634) for the readmissions index. The indices were stable across multiple subsamples defined by demographic characteristics or clinical condition. The addition of other commonly used covariates (age, sex, expected payer) improved discrimination modestly.
3:::A total sample of 352 adult Portuguese urban civil occupational expatriates was obtained. Median length of expatriation was 3 years. Considering a 3-month timeframe, one in five expatriates reported new health problems and need of medical assistance, 5% were hospitalized and 64% reported general psychological symptoms. Less than 2% of subjects were on malaria chemoprophylaxis. Having chronic health conditions doubled the reporting of new health problems. Increasing length of expatriation was associated with decreasing reporting of general psychological symptoms. Directors and executive managers and expatriates living alone tended to report more general psychological symptoms.
3:::The highest prevalence of positive reactions (35.1%) was for PPD. p-Methylaminophenol and o-aminophenol were often positive, both in the PPD-positive and in the PPD-negative patients. Moreover, cysteamine HCl often yielded positive test reactions.
3:::Key research questions in the field of BCHDs are as follows: (1) What are the existing national BCHD practices? (2) What are the patient information and support needs on BCHDs? (3) Which outcomes should be measured across clinical studies in the field of BCHDs? The workshop suggested the following approaches to address these priorities: (1) a service evaluation of current UK BCHD practice; development of a national registry of BCHDs; (2) qualitative research to understand patient information and support needs; development of patient decision support tools; (3) development of core outcome sets for BCHDs.
3:::Gastric half-emptying time significantly increased from the 57th to the 79th percentile (p < 0.001) after gastrostomy (p < 0.001). Fifty percent of patients with normal preoperative gastric emptying develop delayed gastric emptying (DGE, P > 95) after gastrostomy (p = 0.01). Most patients (≥75%) with leakage and/or feeding intolerance after gastrostomy had DGE after operation. A decrease in gastric emptying was associated with an increase in esophageal acid exposure time (r = 0.375, p < 0.001).
3:::There has been increasing recognition of autochthonous HEV infection in Western countries, mainly associated with genotype 3. Chronic HEV infection has been recognised since 2008, and in transplant recipients this may lead to cirrhosis and organ failure. Modes of transmission include food-borne transmission, transfusion of blood products and solid organ transplantation. Ribavirin therapy is used to treat patients with chronic HEV infection, but new therapies are required as there have been reports of treatment failure with ribavirin.
3:::We identified 25 studies including 1648 participants with ovarian cancer. Nine observational studies addressed ERAS protocols. Four of them were prospective, and 3 included historical controls. The other 16 studies reported single interventions, for example, early feeding, omission of pelvic drains, early orogastric tube removal, Doppler-guided fluid management, and patient-controlled epidural analgesia. Early feeding protocols were tested in 7 of the 12 randomized trials. Early feeding appeared to be safe and was associated with significantly faster recovery of bowel function.
3:::Patients with USH2a with a mean age of 59 years at implantation exhibited good performance after CI. The phoneme scores improved significantly from 41 to 87% in patients with USH2a (p = 0.02) and from 30 to 86% in the control group (p = 0.001). The results of the questionnaire survey demonstrated a clear benefit from CI. There were no differences in performance or benefit between patients with USH2a and control patients before and after CI.
3:::A total of 894 separate admissions, representing 845 patients, were analysed. Our analysis shows that there was a 95% probability that survival to hospital discharge was more likely to occur when the maximum workload-to-nurse ratio was <40 and a more than 95% chance that death was more likely to occur when the ratio was >52. Patients exposed to a high workload/nurse ratio (≥52) for ≥1 day during their ICU stay had lower risk-adjusted odds of survival to hospital discharge compared to patients never exposed to a high ratio (odds ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.16-0.79).
3:::All three cholesterol granulomas were successful drained without violating the cochlea, jugular bulb, or carotid artery. The dimensions of the infracochlear surgical corridor measured 5 mm × 6 mm, 3.5 mm × 3.5 mm, and 6 mm × 4 mm, respectively. All corridors facilitated visualization within the cyst and allowed lyses of adhesions for additional cyst content eradication. All patients had resolution of their acute symptoms. Two of the three subjects had serviceable hearing before and after their procedures. One patient required revision surgery 2-months after their initial procedure secondary to recurrent symptoms from acute hemorrhage within the cyst cavity. The infracochlear tract in this patient was noted to be patent.
3:::Measureable intracochlear ECochG responses were obtained from all 14 participants. The 1st harmonic distortions (cochlear microphonic and auditory nerve neurophonic) generally increased steadily with electrode insertion. Electrode and frequency scan following insertion revealed that response amplitude varied based on location of recording electrode and frequency of stimulation. Exquisite sensitivity to manipulation during round window muscle packing was demonstrated.
3:::Of the 2695 participants, 570 (21.2%) and 142 (5.3%) were classified as having TTH and RLS, respectively. Among the 570 individuals with TTH, 113 (19.8%) also met the criteria for probable migraine (PM). The prevalence of RLS was significantly higher among individuals with TTH than among those with non-headache (6.0% vs 3.6%, p = 0.018). The prevalence of RLS was significantly higher in subjects with TTH who fulfilled PM criteria than in those with non-headache participants (8.0% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.018). However, RLS prevalence in individuals with TTH who did not fulfil PM criteria did not differ from that of participants with non-headache (5.5% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.063). TTH participants with RLS had higher visual analogue scale scores for headache intensity (5.1 ± 2.0 vs. 4.3 ± 1.8, p = 0.038), and higher prevalence of anxiety (20.6% vs. 8.8%, p = 0.022) and depression (14.7% vs. 3.5%, p = 0.002) than TTH participants without RLS. Multivariable analyses revealed that headache aggravation by movement (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-5.2) and depression (OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.1-11.4) were significant indicators of RLS among individuals with TTH.
3:::Two thousand seventy-nine patients were assigned 2,468 diagnoses, of which 57.7 and 42.3% were of peripheral and nonperipheral etiologies, respectively. The most common diagnoses were Ménières (23.0%), vestibular migraine (19.3%), benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) (19.1%), and central origin, nonmigraine (16.4%). Peripheral diagnoses are more likely to be found in men than in women (odds ratio [OR] 1.59). Peripheral diagnoses were most likely to be found in the 60 to 69 age group (OR 3.82). There was not a significant difference in rate of vestibular testing between women and men. Among patients with two diagnoses, the most common combinations were vestibular migraine and BPPV then vestibular migraine and Ménière's.'
3:::LRQ reduction after cyclic loading was lower in MB and U than ES constructs. During cyclic loading, suture migration was reduced in MB, U, and DL compared to ES constructs. Mean load at failure was lower in FS and U than in ES constructs.
3:::The shape of the E and A distal femur differed significantly (Goodalls F = 94.43, P < 0.001 and Mahalanobis D2 distance = 1.85, P < 0.001). PCA identified a difference in distal femur shape between A and E. The CVA revealed that correct ethnicity was assigned in 82% of cases and the cross-validation revealed a 75% rate of correct ethnic group estimation.'
3:::Integrated data from registration trials included 2830 vedolizumab-exposed patients (4811 person-years exposure [PYs]) and 513 placebo patients. This reported lower exposure-adjusted incidence rates of infection (63.5/100 PYs; 95% CI: 59.6-67.3) and serious adverse events (20.0/100 PYs; 95% CI: 18.5-21.5) compared to placebo (82.9/100 PYs; 95% CI: 68.3-97.5) and (28.3/100 PYs 95% CI: 20.6-35.9) respectively. Higher, but statistically insignificant rates of enteric infections occurred in vedolizumab-exposed patients (7.4/100 PYs; 95% CI: 6.6-8.3) compared to placebo (6.7 PYs; 95% CI: 3.2-10.1). Six post-marketing cohort studies (1049 patients, 403 PYs) demonstrated rates of infection of 8% (82/1049); enteric infection of 2% (21/1049) and adverse events of 16% (166/1049). Multivariate analysis in one cohort study suggested increased risk of surgical site infection with perioperative VDZ. Human experience in pregnancy is limited.
3:::A total of 4769 patient stays from 38 IRFs were included. Approximately 57% of the sample was female; 38.4%, 75-84 years; and 31.0%, 65-74 years. The final model, containing 77 risk adjusters, explained 53.7% of variance in discharge self-care scores (P<0.0001). Admission self-care function was the strongest predictor, followed by admission cognitive function and IRF primary diagnosis group. The range of expected and observed scores overlapped very well, with little bias across the range of predicted self-care functioning.
3:::After data selection, 1435 cases were included for analysis. Five-year cumulative incidence of cause-specific death was 17.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 15.1-19.8%) and cumulative incidence of other causes of death was 5.8% (95% CI 4.4-7.4%). Predictors of cause-specific death for head and neck ACC included age, tumor size, advanced T stage, positive lymph node, distant metastasis, and surgery. The nomogram was well-calibrated, and had good discriminative ability.
3:::The macrolide resistance rate of M. pneumoniae was 51.1% (48/94) in the 2011 epidemic, and 87.2% (136/156) in the 2015 epidemic. All MRMP isolates had the A2063G point mutation. In comparison of 2 epidemics, the mean age of patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia was increased, and the total febrile days and febrile days after initiation of macrolides were prolonged in the 2015 epidemic. Overall severity of MRMP or macrolide-susceptible M. pneumoniae (MSMP) pneumonia over 2 epidemics was not significantly changed. However, the proportion of patients who had a fever lasting more than 72 hours after initiation of macrolides and who received corticosteroid treatment were higher in MRMP pneumonia during 2 epidemics.
3:::A total of 78,701 lung cancer patients with >5 years survival were identified. This cohort included 54,488 patients surviving 5-10 years and 24,213 patients surviving >10 years. Among patients surviving 5-10 years, 21.8% were dead because of primary lung cancer, 10.2% were dead because of other cancers, 6.8% were dead because of cardiac disease and 5.3% were dead because of non-malignant pulmonary disease. Among patients surviving >10 years, 12% were dead because of primary lung cancer, 6% were dead because of other cancers, 6.9% were dead because of cardiac disease and 5.6% were dead because of non-malignant pulmonary disease. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with longer cardiac-disease-specific survival in multivariate analysis include younger age at diagnosis (p < .0001), white race (vs. African American race) (p = .005), female gender (p < .0001), right-sided disease (p = .003), adenocarcinoma (vs. large cell or small cell carcinoma), histology and receiving local treatment by surgery rather than radiotherapy (p < .0001).
3:::Oestrogen levels were significantly lower in OCP users compared to non-users (209 ± 115 and 433 ± 147 pg/ml, respectively, p = 0.004). Proposed determinants of muscle damage, patella tendon stiffness and maximal eccentric torque did not differ between OCP users and non-users. The change in creatine kinase from pre to peak was significantly higher in OCP users compared to non-users (962 ± 968 and 386 ± 474 Ul, respectively, p = 0.016). There were no other differences in markers of muscle damage.
3:::All displaced flaps extended from the inferior margin of the glenoid into the axillary recess. The average size of the visualized flap was 10.9 by 6.0 by 2.6 mm. Seventy percent of the flaps had signal intensity isointense to labrum and hypointense to hyaline cartilage on T2-weighted images. All 19 patients had concomitant labral pathological conditions and 63% had cartilage defects, visualized on MRI. Clinical evidence of shoulder instability was seen in 83% of patients, and 67% were managed surgically.
3:::The mean value of the SILVER index was 11.52±14.27 in the study group and 1.68±0.98 in the control group (p-value<0.0001). The area under the ROC curve for the SILVER index was 0.903 (95% CI 0.813-0.994). A cut-off value for the SILVER index of 3.75 was extrapolated with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.828 and 0.962 respectively.
3:::Methysticin treatment activated the Nrf2 pathway in the hippocampus and cortex of mice. The Aβ deposition in brains of methysticin-treated APP/Psen1 mice was not altered compared to untreated mice. However, methysticin treatment significantly reduced microgliosis, astrogliosis and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-17A. In addition, the oxidative damage of hippocampi from APP/Psen1 mice was reduced by methysticin treatment. Most importantly, methysticin treatment significantly attenuated the long-term memory decline of APP/Psen1 mice.
3:::Dietary Ca concentrations had no effect on growth performance of growing broiler chickens. However, a tendency (linear, p = 0.05) for decreased feed efficiency was observed as dietary Ca concentrations were increased. The concentrations of Ca and P in the tibia of broiler chickens increased (linear and quadratic, p<0.01) with increasing Ca concentrations in low NPP diets containing phytase. Litter pH, moisture, and N contents were not affected by increasing Ca concentrations in low NPP diets containing phytase. However, a tendency (quadratic, p = 0.10) for increased FPD incidence with increasing dietary Ca concentrations was observed.
3:::167 patients were included in the study. The NEUROD2 exonic polymorphism rs11078918 showed significant associations with verbal memory and executive functions, whereas the NEUROD2 polymorphism rs12453682 was significantly associated with working and verbal memory, executive functions and with a cognitive index. Significant associations were found at baseline and after eight weeks. Moreover, significant associations between the change in neuropsychological test results during antipsychotic treatment and the NEUROD2 polymorphisms rs11078918 and rs12453682 were observed.
3:::Chromosomal analysis revealed that 17% (15/88) of embryos derived from 1PN 2PB zygotes were diagnosed as euploid. After blastomere biopsy at day 3, the blastocyst rate at day 5 was 3.4% (3/88). Only 2.3% (2/88) euploid blastocysts were obtained. In two couples and after counseling and patient agreement, the transfer of a euploid blastocyst from a 1PN 2PB ICSI zygote was performed resulting in the birth of a healthy child.
3:::Differences in rs2010963 genotype distributions were observed between MDD patients and controls. Significant G×E interactions between allelic variation of rs2010963 and negative life events were observed. Individuals carrying the C alleles were susceptible to MDD only when exposed to high-negative life events.
3:::The sampling efficiency by swab was 46%, as compared with 93% for acid wipe sampling, for all tested doses. Most metal from the skin dose was detected in the first swab (33-43%). Despite lower sampling efficiency by swab, skin doses of metals following 2 h of leisure activity without hand washing were quantified in all participants, and ranged from 0.0016 to 0.15 µg/cm(2) , from 0.00014 to -0.0020 µg/cm(2) and from 0.00048 to -0.027 µg/cm(2) for nickel, cobalt, and chromium, respectively.
3:::In normal tissue (NT), OD + LDS caused minimal histologic damage and a significant reduction in BALF total protein (p < 0.05) and MMP-9 activity (p < 0.05), as compared with OD + HDS. In acutely injured tissue (ALIT), OD + LDS resulted in reduced histologic injury and pulmonary edema (p < 0.05), as compared with OD + HDS.
3:::Median urinary triclosan concentrations were 16ng/mL (range: <2.4 to 1501ng/mL). Each 10-fold increase in triclosan was associated with a predicted 0.15 standard deviation decrease (95% CI: -0.30, 0.00) in birth weight z-score, 0.4-cm decrease (95% CI: -0.8, 0.1) in birth length, 0.3-cm decrease (95% CI: -0.5, 0.0) in head circumference, and 0.3-week decrease (95% CI: -0.6, -0.1) in gestational age. Child sex did not modify the associations between triclosan and birth outcomes.
3:::In the multivariate analysis, only sIA size (P<0.004) and irregular shape (P<0.000) independently associated with sIA rupture. As an independent risk factor, irregular shape showed the strongest association with rupture (odds ratio 90.3; 95% confidence interval, 47.0-173.5). The sIA location, flow angles, bottleneck factor, or aspect ratio were not significantly associated with rupture.
3:::Of 8001 citations, we retrieved 57 full-text articles and ultimately included two randomized-controlled trials (894 patients). Higher blood pressure targets were not associated with lower mortality (relative risk [RR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.23; P = 0.54), and neither age (P = 0.17) nor chronic hypertension (P = 0.32) modified the overall effect. Nevertheless, higher blood pressure targets were associated with a greater risk of new-onset supraventricular cardiac arrhythmia (RR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.28 to 3.38; P < 0.01).
3:::A total of 100 patients were included (age 70.7±9.7years, 95% male, body mass index 28.9±5.3kg/m(2), left ventricular ejection fraction 33.5±7.7%, New York Heart Association class III 65%. DLCO and oxygenation were significantly correlated with hypoxemic burden (p<0.05). Mean oxygen saturation, oxygen desaturation, C-reactive protein level and pH were significantly associated with CSA-CSR severity (p<0.05).
3:::Three groups were identified: 1) LP group (n=16, 12%), 2) NP group (n=93, 69%) and 3) HP group (n=25, 19%). There were significant differences between the groups in premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ) (p=0.010), axis II comorbidity (p=0.008), subthreshold depressive symptoms (p=0.027), general functioning (p=0.013) and in four specific functional domains: autonomy, occupation, interpersonal relations and leisure time. Significant differences in neurocognitive performance were found between groups with the LP group showing the lowest attainments.
3:::No packing was associated with better expected utilities than packing. On sensitivity analysis, packing was preferred when the disutility of no packing outweighed the disutility of packing, and when the probability for synechiae was greater than 35% without packing or lower than 2% with packing. When the component of packing removal was subtracted from the overall disutility simulating absorbable packing, the results favored packing.
3:::Of 173 patients with c-spine fractures, 36 (21%) were asymptomatic and reported no neck pain on presentation or on examination. The group without neck pain had higher median injury severity scores (15 vs 10; p < 0.001), were more likely to have another injured body region (69% vs 42%; p = 0.004), and had longer hospitalization (7 vs 5 days; p = 0.008) than patients with neck pain. Twenty-two percent of the symptomatic group and 19% of the asymptomatic group required halo, fusion, or other surgical intervention.
3:::A total of 880 364 patients were prescribed a single RAS blocker during the study period. Prevalence of co-prescribing increased from 4812 patients per million person-years in Q1 2009 to 4865 in Q1 2010. A reduction then occurred decreasing to 2901 patients per million person-years in Q2 2014 when the EU review concluded and continued to decrease thereafter despite a continued increase in the prevalence of prescribing of a single RAS blocker. Incidence of new co-prescribing decreased from 454 patients per million person-years in Q1 2009 to 159 in Q2 2014, but remained relatively constant at ~119 patients per million person-years on average after the EU review concluded. A total of 96% of co-prescriptions were for an ACE inhibitor + ARB, and 4% accounted for an ACE inhibitor or ARB + renin inhibitor.
3:::The frequency of medication errors by caregivers in infants discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit was 66.3%. Dose administration error, that is, measurement of a dose different from what was prescribed was the most common error (54%). A prescription containing more than three drugs was found to have statistically significant association (OR 4.19, CI 1.59 to 11.07, p=0.00).
3:::A total of 2,034 eligible trauma patients were screened by clinical social workers at each site over 1 year. The mean age was 37.05 ± 20.32 with 63% men, 37% women, and one transgendered participant. The overall rate of IPSV was 11.4%. The proportion of positive screens for men was 9.3%, with variability between centers (3.8-72.7%), and for women was 16.1% (15.3-50.0%) (p < 0.001). The transgendered patient screened positive for IPSV. Of patients who screened positive for IPSV, 60.0% had one or more trauma-associated comorbidity compared to 15.1% of patients who screened negative (p < 0.001).
3:::Over the trial wearing period, the average change in the spherical component of the over-refraction was +0.06 D (S.D. 0.17) (p = 0.16). The average change in cylinder was +0.04 D (S.D. 0.19) (p = 0.33). The average absolute change in axis was 1.06° (S.D. 12.11) (p = 0.74). The average change in best sphere was +0.13 ± 0.30 D (p = 0.12). There was no significant change in visual acuity with the best sphere over-refraction over the 6-8 h wearing period. There was a significant change in central corneal clearance over the wearing period of 83 μm (S.D. 22) (p < 0.0001).
3:::A total of 23,548 surgical procedures were performed at R2 facilities, while 165,619 surgical procedures were performed at R3 facilities. The most common surgical procedures performed overall were soft tissue (37.5%), orthopedic (13.84%), abdominal (13.01%), and vascular (6.53%). The least common surgical procedures performed overall were cardiac (0.23%), peripheral nervous system (0.53%), and spine (0.34%).Mean surgical workload at any point in time clearly underrepresented those units in highly kinetic areas, at times by an order of magnitude or more. The published literature always demonstrated workloads well in excess of the 50th percentile for the relevant time period.
3:::The annual prevalence of exclusive breast-feeding and AD decreased. Parents with allergic diseases preferred breast-feeding and extended duration of feeding compared with those without. In multiple logistic regression analyses, exclusive breast-feeding in feeding type I (P=0.070; adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.990), exclusive breast-feeding in feeding type II (P=0.095; adjusted OR=1.495) and breast-feeding duration (P=0.430; adjusted OR=1.013) were not significantly related to AD.
3:::The receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis suggested that 1 mg DST, at a cut-off of 1.8 µg/dL, had the best accuracy for detecting patients with increased CVE risk. In patients with 1 mg-DST ≥1.8 µg/dL (DST+, n = 223), age and prevalence of AH, T2DM, DL and CVE (66 years, 74.5, 25.9, 41.4 and 26.8% respectively) were higher than that of patients with 1 mg-DST ≤1.8 µg/dL (61.9 years, 60.7, 18.5, 32.9 and 10%, respectively, P < 0.05 for all). The CVE were associated with DST+ (OR: 2.46, 95% CI: 1.5-4.1, P = 0.01), regardless of T2DM, AH, DL, smoking habit, gender, observation period and age. The presence of at least two among AH, T2DM, DL and OB plus DST+ had 61.1% sensitivity in detecting patients with CVE. By using the variables selected by ANNs (familial CVE history, age, T2DM, AH, DL and DST+) 78.7% sensitivity was reached.
3:::A significant association between neighbourhood-level coverage of improved household sanitation and diarrhoeal morbidity (OR [95% CI] = 0.68 [0.62-0.76]) was found. Exposure-relationship analyses results showed improved sanitation coverage threshold at 0.6. We found marginal degree of association (OR [95% CI] = 0.82 [0.77-0.87]) below the threshold, which, beyond the threshold, sharply increased to OR of 0.44 (95% CI: 0.29-0.67) at sanitation coverage of 1 (i.e. neighbourhood-wide use of improved household sanitation). Similar exposure-response trends were identified for urban and rural subgroups.
3:::Mean age was 26 years among women and 32 years among men. Before CHTC, safe sex was comparable among female-positive couples (8%) and female-negative couples (2%) [risk ratio (RR): 3.7, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5 to 29.8]. One month after CHTC, safe sex was higher among female-positive couples (75%) than among female-negative couples (3%) (RR: 30.0, 95% CI: 4.3 to 207.7). Safe sex increased substantially after CTHC for female-positive couples (RR 9.6, 95% CI: 4.6 to 20.0), but not for female-negative couples (RR: 1.2, 95% CI: 0.1 to 18.7).
3:::Administration of the oil at the dose of 100 mg/kg increased the latency for the first myoclonic jerk and the first generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The duration of generalized convulsions induced by PTZ was not altered. No significant behavioral adverse effects were detected in the open-field, rotarod, forced swim, or object recognition tests. Interestingly, a significant antioxidant activity of Caryocar coriaceum Wittm. fixed pulp oil was detected in the DPPH scavenging assay.
3:::Of 376 enrolled children, 374 (99.5%) completed the questionnaire. Some foods were eliminated by 18.6% and 13.0% of all children and those ≥6 years old, respectively. The target population for the secondary survey included 69 children who all completed the medical interview. The target population for the third survey consisted of 35 children, of whom 26 (74.3%) underwent the blood test. An OFC was performed 35 times with 20 children. As a result, the prevalence of FA was 4.9% in children of all ages and 4.7% in those ≥6 years old. Moreover, 55.0% children were able to cease eliminating food intake.
3:::In foetal organs, the average concentrations of perfluorooctanesulphonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDa), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) were 0.6ng/g, 0.2ng/g, 0.1ng/g, 0.1ng/g, and 0.1ng/g, respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between the exposure duration, defined as foetal age, and foetal to maternal ratio for all five PFASs and cotinine. Smokers presented 99ng/g cotinine in plasma, 108ng/g in placenta, and 61ng/g in foetal organs. No correlation between the maternal cotinine concentrations and PFAS concentrations was found.
3:::The clinical trials were double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials with a total of 879 subjects. The meta-analysis found significant reduction in risk of travellers diarrhoea with rifaximin use compared to placebo (pooled RR 0.478, 95% CI: 0.375-0.610, and P  < 0.001). For the entire travel and follow-up period, the risk of developing travellers' diarrhoea was significantly greater in individuals receiving the placebo than those receiving rifaximin (daily doses of 400-600 mg). Overall, rifaximin offered significant protection rates of 48-72%, with lower protection rates for Asian than Latin American countries. In terms of tolerability, similar rates of adverse events were reported for the rifaximin and placebo group ( P  > 0.05), with no clinically significant or serious adverse events related to rifaximin use.'
3:::In total, 37 studies were eligible for the systematic review (n = 45,733) and of these, 34 studies were included in the meta-analyses (n = 45,358). There were overall associations between childhood chronic physical illness and adult depression (OR = 1.31; 95% CI [1.12, 1.54]) and anxiety (OR = 1.47; 95% CI [1.13, 1.92]). Separate meta-analyses for childhood asthma, type 1 diabetes and cancer were also conducted, with cancer being significantly associated with adult depression (OR = 1.19; 95% CI [1.00, 1.42]).
3:::There was no carry-over effect. Within-condition comparisons suggest that both interventions lead to changes in scapular and shoulder muscle activity levels. No differences between clinician-administered and self-administered mobilizations at intervention and follow-up were found for the monitored muscles, with the exception of upper trapezius.
3:::The median (interquartile range) PASP was 33 (28-37) mm Hg, and elevated PASP (>40mmHg) was observed in 66 (17.6%) patients. Seventeen of the 66 (25.8%) patients with elevated PASP and 24 of the 308 (7.8%) patients without elevated PASP experienced stroke and systemic embolic events during the 10.3±7.4years of follow-up (log-rank P<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that age at diagnosis, atrial fibrillation, and PASP >40mmHg (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-5.12; P=0.006) were independently associated with embolic events.
3:::There were 1,180,144 patients admitted for trauma, the 30-day readmission rate was 9.4%, and 26.4% of readmissions occurred at a different hospital. The median readmission cost for patients readmitted to the same hospital was $8,298 (interquartile range, $4,899-$14,911), whereas the median readmission cost for patients readmitted to a different hospital was $8,568 (interquartile range, $4,935-$16,078; p < 0.01). Multivariate regression revealed that patients discharged against medical advice were at increased risk of readmission (odds ratio, 2.79; p < 0.01) and readmission to a different facility (odds ratio, 1.58; p < 0.01). Home health care was associated with a decreased risk of readmission to a different hospital (odds ratio, 0.74; p < 0.01). Septicemia and disseminated infections were the most common diagnoses on readmission (8.4%) and readmission to a different hospital (8.6%).
3:::Compared with polyenergetic images, superior signal-to-noise ratio and superior contrast-to-noise ratio of gray and white matter were observed in virtual monoenergetic images at low kiloelectron volt levels (P < 0.0001). Subcalvarial artifacts were significantly lower at 120 keV (P < 0.02). Artifacts measured in the posterior fossa were generally lower at high kiloelectron volt levels; however, no statistical significance was detected. Virtual monoenergetic images were rated superior to polyenergetic images in regard to all 4 criteria (P < 0.0001). The observers reported an optimal radiological assessment of gray-white matter differentiation at 65 keV and optimal assessment of subcalvarial space at 120 keV.
3:::Significant PME (increase in the foveal 3-mm zone thickness of >19.5 μm) was observed in 31 (44%) eyes with POAG and in 14 (21%) control eyes (P = .003). The extent of PME was maximal at 3 months postoperatively and decreased gradually until 12 months. Regression tree analysis revealed that the risk of PME was the greatest in the POAG group using prostaglandin analogue (PGA) (odds ratio [OR] = 5.51), followed by POAG not using PGA (OR = 1.70), and control group (OR = 1.0). Risk factors for PME were younger age in all groups (OR = 1.07), systemic hypertension in PGA users (OR = 6.42), higher untreated IOP in PGA nonusers (OR = 1.09) and male sex (OR = 14.06) and diabetes mellitus (OR = 16.71) in the control group.
3:::We found that 87% (52/60) of the arthroscopic procedures allowed professional football players to return to play in a preseason or regular season game. Athletes who returned played an average of 38 games during 3.2 seasons after arthroscopy, with an average total career length of 7.4 seasons. Ninety-two percent (48/52) of players who returned had a minimum total career length of 3 years. When participants were analyzed by position, linemen were less likely to return after hip arthroscopy compared with other players (odds ratio 5.6; 95% CI, 1.1-35; P = .04). All quarterbacks and tight ends returned to play after surgery. No significant difference in return to play rate was found between athletes who underwent microfracture and those who did not (25% vs 38%, P = .698).
3:::304 patients were included with a median follow-up of 43.3 months (Q1-Q3 28.7-61.1) and a mean age of 49.7 years (SD 10.9). Quantitative ER was inversely associated with tumor size reduction and pCR (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.99-1.00, p = 0.027 and 0.98 95% CI 0.97-0.99, p < 0.0001, respectively). A cut-off of 60 and 80% predicted best the association with tumor size reduction and pCR, respectively. pCR was shown to be an independent predictor of RFS (HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.07-0.43, p = 0.0002) in all patients. At 5 years, 93% of patients with pCR and 72% of patients with residual tumor were recurrence-free, respectively (p = 0.0012).
3:::The incidence of AMD in LSOCA was 0.65/100 person-years (PY). In a multivariate analysis the only significant risk factor for AMD in LSOCA was smoking; the relative risk vs never-smokers was 3.4 for former smokers (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3, 9.5; P = .02) and 3.3 for current smokers (95% CI 1.1, 9.7; P = .03). Compared with the MESA cohort, the race/ethnicity- and sex-adjusted risk of AMD in LSOCA was 1.75 (95% CI 1.16, 2.64; P = .008), despite the fact that the mean age of the MESA cohort was 17 years greater than the LSOCA cohort (61 ± 9 years vs 44 ± 8 years).
3:::Higher mean adherence values and proportions of adherent patients were obtained using MPR versus PDC, with additional differences depending on the approach used. The proportion of adherent patients was lowest for oral antidiabetics (14.4%-30.6%) and highest for antihypertensives (70.2%-82.1%). The use of surrogate daily dose values increased adherence for antidiabetics and statins and decreased adherence for antihypertensives. After a 1 year follow-up, treatment persistence was observed for 21.1%, 58.7%, and 29.5% of antidiabetic, antihypertensive and statin users, respectively.
3:::A significant proportion of paediatricians (21-52%) did not regularly use CMA for conditions with established evidence of diagnostic yield. Paediatricians under-estimated the potential for CMA findings to alter patient management. There was wide variability in paediatricians approach to consent, and low use of consent forms and fact sheets. Paediatricians reported difficulties interpreting CMA results, with high rates of referral to clinical genetics services.'
3:::Statistical analysis showed a correlation between BMI>50 kg/m2, presence of metabolic syndrome, presence of diabetes, gastric pouch volume greater than 60 mL and failure of weight loss outcome. Statistical analysis of metabolic failure has recognized a high preoperative glycated hemoglobin percentage (HbA1c%) value as a statistically significant negative predictive factor.
3:::In all cases, 3-dimensional anisotropy contrast periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (3DAC-PROPELLER) successfully revealed the inner structures within the lesion. The isolated type represented the normal course of the nerve isolated from scar-like tissue (8 cases), whereas the deformity type included the deformed nerve either within scar-like tissue or by itself, unassociated with surrounding scar-like tissue (9 cases). In the remaining 2 cases, the nerve tissue and scar-like tissue were incorporated. Patients with the deformity type exhibited significantly more severe pain symptoms compared with patients with the isolated type.
3:::Three patients were diagnosed with Pompes disease and recommended for enzyme replacement therapy. The prevalence of Pompe, a rare disease, in our diaphragmatic paralysis patient sample was 16.8%.'
3:::Among 751 888 children in the cohort, 9098 (1.21%) received a diagnosis of ASDs. We observed an increased risk of ASDs in the exposed children (IRR = 1.28, 1.11-1.47), especially for those who were exposed during the second trimester period (IRR = 1.38, 1.14-1.67). However, when extending the exposure time window to 1 year prior to pregnancy, we observed a similar association in children born to women who received β2AA treatment during pregnancy (IRR = 1.33, 1.11-1.59) to that in children born to women who received β2AA treatment 1 year prior to pregnancy (IRR = 1.35, 1.17-1.56).
3:::We documented 785 new TB cases during 654 977 person-years of follow-up. The incident rate of TB was 224.20 (206.69, 243.16) per 100 000 person-years among men and 51.34 (44.75, 58.92) per 100 000 person-years among women. A 1-unit increase of BMI was associated with a risk reduction in 16% (P < 0.01) for men and a 14% (P < 0.01) reduction for women. TB cases were more likely to be insulin-dependent [men: hazard ratio = 2.13 (1.29, 3.53); women: 3.28 (1.28, 8.39)] and had a poor glucose level initially [men: 1.21 (1.15, 1.27); women: 1.27 (1.18, 1.37)]. The risk factor for TB specific to men was a young age at diagnosis of diabetes, and the protective factor specific to women was actively engaging in physical activity.
3:::BA significantly reduced the ischemic infarct volume (P<0.05), whereas CM was ineffective. Two processes and 10 network nodes were shared between ""BA vs CM"" and vehicle, but there were no overlapping pathways. Two pathways, three processes and 12 network nodes overlapped in ""BA vs CM"" and BA. The pure pharmacological mechanism of BA resulted in targeting of pathways related to development, G-protein signaling, apoptosis, signal transduction and immunity. The biological processes affected by BA were primarily found to correlate with apoptotic, anti-apoptotic and neurophysiological processes. Three network nodes changed from up-regulation to down-regulation, while mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6 (MAP2K6, also known as MEK6) changed from down-regulation to up-regulation in ""BA vs CM"" and vehicle. The changed nodes were all related to cell death and development.
3:::Of the 352 cases with EMCs, 155 had surgical follow-up. They showed no malignancy in the 89 women between 40-49 years, compared with five malignancies in the 66 women 50+ years (p = .016). The number of cases with significant pathology (hyperplasia and malignant) was 4 (40-49 years) vs. 11 (50+ years) (p = 0.029). The LMP was inconsistently provided (57%) and women identified as postmenopausal on requisition comprised all the malignancies and half the hyperplasias.
3:::Differences in pain severity scores were statistically significant between Groups I and II, Groups I and III, Groups I and IV and between Groups II and III (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was determined between Groups III and IV (p = 0.401).
3:::Tetra-Pt(bpy) inhibits the strand invasion/annealing step of telomeric homologous recombination by selectively converting telomeric ssDNA to a G-quadruplex. ALT-cells treated with Tetra-Pt(bpy) show fewer ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies (untreated: mean±SD = 5.9±0.2 vs treated: mean±SD = 3.1±0.1, P < .001), fewer extrachromosomal C-circles (untreated: mean±SD = 100.5±1.6 vs treated: mean±SD = 18.0±1.7, P < .001), and reduced telomere sister chromatin exchanges (untreated: mean±SD = 25.2%±1.5% vs treated: mean±SD = 13.1%±1.9%, P < .001). Consequently, critically short telomeres accumulate after multiple population doublings (untreated: mean±SD = 18.9%±1.7% vs treated: mean±SD = 57.4%±2.2%, P < .001), resulting in cell death by apoptosis or senescence. In vivo, Tetra-Pt(bpy) severely inhibits the growth of ALT-cell xenograft tumors in mice (untreated: mean±SD = 57.1±3.7 mm 3 vs treated: mean±SD = 19.0±3.2 mm 3 , P < .001). Importantly, Tetra-Pt(bpy) exhibits no adverse effects on proliferation, gene expression, or telomere metabolism in normal cells.
3:::Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)-MRI, performed within 24 h following onset of seizures and repeated 48 h later, clearly showed restricted diffusion within the middle cerebral artery territory on both MRIs, but clear patterns of signal intensity changes in the descending corticospinal tracts on the second MRI only.
3:::The results showed increases in NSCF during both situational and verbal cueing, compared to baseline. However, no relation to PTSS scores was indicated. Negative correlations between NSCF during situational cueing and both PTSS-T2 and PTSS-CS were found among women, but not among men.
3:::In a 32-month period, there were 23478 visits to the Hands-Only CPR Kiosk and 9006 test sessions; of those practice sessions, 26.2% achieved correct chest compression rate, 60.2% achieved correct chest compression depth, and 63.5% had the correct hand position.
3:::1. The number of words generated during the VFT tasks in SPD patients were fewer than healthy controls. 2. The activated areas in SPD patients were smaller than healthy controls. 3. The average activation strength of [oxy-Hb] in SPD patients was much lower than healthy controls. 4. The difference of activation areas between left and right lobe were particularly obvious in SPD patients.
3:::About half (52%) of the participants who sustained a DRF exhibited an inadequate health literacy, and the rate of non-adherence to osteoporosis treatment was 38%. The rate of non-adherence for patients with inadequate literacy was significantly higher than for those with appropriate literacy (47 vs. 29%, p = 0.04). The results of the regression analysis indicate that limited health literacy, the presence of comorbidities, and prior history of adverse drug events are associated with a higher likelihood of non-adherence to osteoporosis treatment after sustaining a DRF.
3:::A total of 56 lurasidone-treated and 47 placebo-treated pre-menopausal females, and 17 lurasidone-treated and 25 placebo-treated post-menopausal females were available from the larger study for comparison on key outcome measures. The pre- and post-menopausal subgroups had similar demographic and clinical characteristics at study baseline (other than age), including number of past major depressive episodes as well as depressive and manic symptom severity. Mean daily lurasidone dose was similar for each subgroup during the study. Both the primary and exploratory analyses showed that both lurasidone-treated post-menopausal and pre-menopausal females responded significantly compared to placebo (p=0.016 or less) on the MADRS, and that post-menopausal patients had a numerically larger response (effect size=0.96) than pre-menopausal patients (effect size=0.64). All other secondary outcome measures for lurasidone compared with placebo treatment were significant (p=0.045 or less) for both subgroups.
3:::The overall standardized effect of age was large for ground reaction forces, moderate for ankle and small for knee and hip kinematics and ankle and hip kinetics. When the analysis was restricted to studies with similar or matched walking speed, the standardized effects of age remained similar except for hip power generation and knee kinematic variables.
3:::From 205 trials included, 6158 different measurements of 100 different outcome domains were reported, with a median of 22 domains per trial (IQR 13-41). Overall, 52 domains (52%) were surrogate, 38 (38%) were clinical, and 10 (10%) were patient-reported. The 5 most commonly reported domains were blood pressure (76 [37%] trials), relapse/remission (70 [34%]), kidney function (66 [32%]), infection (61 [30%]), and height/pubertal development (51 [25%]). Mortality (14%), cardiovascular disease (4%), and quality of life (1%) were reported infrequently. The 2 most frequently reported outcomes, blood pressure and relapse/remission, had 56 and 81 different outcome measures, respectively.
3:::The mean age of participants was 48.35 years, and 16.8% were ≥65 years. Of the responders, 21.7% were vaccinated this year, whereas 57.8% did not desire to get it. Vaccination rates were significantly higher among responders ≥65 years of age (56.4%), those having at least 1 chronic illness (46.5%), and those who were vaccinated regularly every year (22.2%). Half of the responders did not know that the vaccine was reimbursed for people at risk. The most common reason for refusing the influenza vaccine was not getting the flu frequently (51.2%). Fear of side effects, concerns about vaccines effectiveness, and belief that vaccine causes the flu were other common reasons for not being vaccinated. Of the responders, 77% believed that getting official information or a recommendation from a physician would influence their decision about seasonal influenza vaccination.'
3:::Median follow-up period was 699.7days. Mean age, body mass index (BMI), and HbA1c level were 65.7years, 24.6kg/m(2), and 7.5% (58.1mmol/mol), respectively. Positive dipstick hematuria was significantly associated with baseline eGFR and severity of albuminuria (p<0.001). The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio for eGFR decline in patients with dipstick hematuria compared with those without dipstick hematuria was 2.19 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-3.91]; this association remained significant even after the exclusion of patients who did not have diabetic retinopathy (hazard ratio: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.13-5.04).
3:::We found that in SKBR3-TR cells and conditioned medium-treated parental cells, constitutive phosphorylated STAT3 coincided with prominent up-regulation of HIF-1α which was accompanied with PTEN attenuation. Moreover, the inhibition of STAT3 activation by Stattic and/or genetically STAT3 knocking down decreased HIF-1α level in SKBR3-TR cells. Additionally, treatment with Stattic and/or STAT3 siRNA engendered the up-regulation of PTEN protein in STAT3-inhibited resistant cells. Restoration of PTEN was also observed following siRNA-mediated silencing of HIF-1α expression. Moreover, down-regulation of HIF-1α caused a reduction in the HES-1 content. Further study with HES-1 specific siRNA revealed the elevation of PTEN expression in HES-1 knock-down trastuzumab resistant cells.
3:::Of 37,999 cases that captured all ESS variables, 14,446 (38%) resulted in at least one 30-day complication. The observed probability of a 30-day complication gradually increased from 7% to 53% to 91% at scores of 0, 7, and 15, respectively, with a c-statistic of 0.78. For ESS >15, the complication rate plateaued at a mean of 92%. On multivariable analyses, each of the 22 ESS components independently predicted the occurrence of postoperative complications.
3:::The total number of enrolled patients was 330 (aged 81±11years, 47% female, left ventricular ejection fraction 64±9%). The RPV was feasible in 275 (83%). Vmax and Mean Gradient were significantly higher and aortic valve area was significantly lower from RPV as compared to apical view (p<0.0001 for all). Reclassification of severity towards either moderate or severe AS occurred in 13-26% of patients, according to different criteria, when evaluated from RPV. Among 108 patients (40%) undergoing multiple examinations the rate of progression was lower from the apical approach than from the RPV (0.19±0.20m/s/year vs. 0.24±0.27m/s/year, respectively; p=0.03), and was fast (>0.3m/s/year) in 17 patients (16%) from the apical window vs. 26 patients (24%) from RPV (p<0.0001).
3:::One-hundred-three ultrafiltration sessions were performed in 55 patients with AHF (average 1.9±1.7 treatment/patient). The overall median length of ultrafiltration treatment was 14h (interquartile range 7-21) with removal of 3266±3088ml of fluid (183±30ml/hour). The treatment was successfully completed in 92 (89%) sessions and in 80% of patients. The mean suction flow rate from the vein was 70±20ml/min, while the mean re-injection flow rate was 98±26ml/min. There were no clinically relevant complications related to the venous access and/or to the anticoagulant therapy with heparin.
3:::VAS pain and weakness, 2-PD, key-pinch strength, grip strength, first dorsal interosseous muscle strength, Wartenberg sign, and claw hand all improved significantly. DASH scores improved from an average of 43.8 points preoperatively to 10.7 points postoperatively. According to the modified Bishop scoring system, 55 extremities (93.2%) were graded good or excellent. At the last follow-up, 29 hands (49.2%) returned to normal, and improvement by at least one McGowan grade was reached in 51 cases (86.4%). Older age, smoking, and shorter postoperative follow-up were associated with a higher postoperative McGowan grade.
3:::137 thrombocytopenic patients (104,985 patient-exposure days) were compared against 939 normal patients (715,193 patient-exposure days). IRR of minor, major bleeding and thrombosis among thrombocytopenic patients were 3.03 (95% CI: 1.57-5.60), 1.48 (95% CI: 0.44-3.98), and 0.807 (95% CI: 0.09-3.43) respectively. Median INR and platelet count readings during minor and major bleeds were 3.60 (IQR: 2.70-4.12) and 3.12 (IQR: 2.82-4.22), and 99×10(9)/L (IQR: 77.0-147.0×10(9)/L) and 115×10(9)/L (IQR: 107.5-169.5×10(9)/L) respectively.
3:::The ICC value for the Nazarian technique was 0.82 (very good) and 0.51 (moderate) for the JW technique. When using the modified JW technique, we found an ICC value of 0.84 (very good). Mean ligament thickness was greatest with the Nazarian technique, 6.41 mm, with the JW technique measuring 1.86 mm and the modified technique measuring 1.38 mm.
3:::Frequencies of iodothyronine deiodinase genotypes and well-being scores were not different in hypothyroid subjects according to their disease types. Minor genotypes of a few iodothyronine deiodinase 1 variants (rs11206244, rs2294512, and rs4926616) were associated with reduced psychological well-being. However, iodothyronine deiodinase 2 and 3 variants had no effect on baseline well-being.
3:::A total of 4340 adults with diabetes and 2329 health professionals participated in the surveys. Diabetic eye disease (DED) without macular edema (DME) was reported by 19.5% of adults with diabetes and a further 7.6% reported that they had DME. Although 94% of adults with diabetes saw a health care professional for their diabetes, only 79% had ever had an eye examination for DED, and 23% had not had an eye examination in the last year. Moreover, 65% of the ophthalmologists surveyed reported that most patients presented when visual problems had already occurred. Overall, 62% of people with DED had received treatment. Of these, 74% had laser therapy, 29% surgery and 24% anti-VEGF therapy.
3:::PE developed in 49 patients. Univariate analysis showed the mean heart dose, heart V5-V55, mean pericardium dose, and pericardium V5-V50 to all significantly affect the incidence of PE. Additionally, body surface area was correlated with the incidence of PE in multivariate analysis. Grade 3 and 4 SPE developed in 5 patients. The pericardium V50 and pericardium D10 significantly affected the incidence of SPE. The pericardium V50 in patients with SPE ranged from 17.1 to 21.7%. Factors affecting the incidence of SPE were the V50 of the pericardium zones within 3 cm and 4 cm of the esophagus.
3:::BMI, asthma and allergy were not associated with bipolar disorder. Higher grip strength, cognitive function and stress resilience were associated with a reduced risk of bipolar disorder and the other disease outcomes.
3:::Three institutions recommended evaluation for surgery. If the patient was not a surgical candidate, and/or refused surgery, definitive chemoradiation was recommended, including retreating the primary to full dose. European participants were more in favor of a non-surgical approach. None of the participants were reluctant to prescribe reirradiation, but two institutions prescribed doses lower than 60 Gy. Platinum-based doublets together with intensity-modulated radiotherapy were preferred.
3:::The intraobserver reproducibility was very good for all examiners, with a weighted κ index ranging from 0.84 to 0.91. The interobserver reproducibility was good or very good for all estimated comparisons, with a weighted κ index ranging from 0.77 to 0.96, regardless of experience level.
3:::Compared to non-RCG, those with RCG had significantly higher levels of childhood and adult SA. The RCG was significantly associated with childhood SA threshold score (OR=2.85, 90%CI: 1.08-7.50). Childhood SA was, in turn, strongly associated with a threshold SA score in adulthood (OR=15.58; 95% CI: 4.62-52.59).
3:::The CA1, CA2/3, CA4/DG, as well as total hippocampal gray matter were reduced in volume in CB-dep but not in CB-nondep users, relative to HC. The right CA2/3 and CA4/DG volumes were also negatively associated with lifetime cannabis use in CB-dep users.
3:::Radiographic mean bone loss was less than 0.5 mm in all groups, with no statistically significant differences between the groups. Implant survival rate at 1 year was 93.3%, with 2/30 implants failing to integrate prior to functional loading at 6 weeks. No statistically significant difference was found between ISQ measurements between the three groups at all time intervals measured. Strong positive correlations were found between overall bone loss at 6 months and insertion torque at time of placement. A very weak correlation was found between insertion torque and ISQ values at time of implant placement.
3:::A total of 75 COPD and 20 control subjects were included. The subjects with COPD were classified according to COPD stage, with 20 grade I, II, and III subjects, respectively, and 15 grade IV subjects. In COPD grade II, residual volume/total lung capacity was negatively correlated with airway wall area in LB5 (r = -0.51). In COPD grade III, FVC was negatively correlated with airway wall area percentage in LB5 (r = -0.49) but positively correlated with airway wall area in RB6 (r = 0.52); percent-of-predicted FEV1 was negatively correlated with airway wall area percentage in RB1 (r = -0.49); residual volume was negatively correlated with airway wall area (r = -0.47), and total lung capacity was negatively correlated with airway wall area in RB1 (r = -0.52) (all, P < .001).
3:::In general, protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation increased while antioxidant capacity decreased significantly in tumors compared to the controls (p<0.05) and higher the grade of the tumor, higher the levels of oxidation and lower the anti-oxidation.
3:::Compared with control, TNF-α concentration- and time-dependently increased HT22 cell apoptosis, which was attenuated by 25μmol/l propofol. TNF-α (40ng/ml, 24h) induced the overexpression of iNOS and the release of nitric oxide, caused the accumulation of intracellular Ca(2+) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and therefore leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, these effects were alleviated by 25μmol/l propofol.
3:::Olfactory disorder assessment is a promising method for improving both the early and differential diagnosis of Alzheimers disease. However, the current lack of consensus on which tests should be used does not permit the consistent integration of olfactory disorder assessment into clinical settings.'
3:::Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) or repair had a high incidence (46 per 100,000 persons/year). In addition, the most frequent grafts included hamstring tendon (90%) and the patellar tendon (6.3%) autografts (2013). Peak age group for ACLR was 15-20 years (14.5%) for female and 20-25 years (23.6%) for male patients, while there was a second peak in the age group 45-50 years (13.8%) for female patients. Male patients had a higher risk for receiving ACLR (RR 1.96; 95% CI 1.92-2.00) and for receiving valgizing high tibial osteotomy (RR 2.43; 95% CI 2.27-2.61). Females had a higher risk for receiving varizing distal femur osteotomy (RR 1.89; 95% CI 1.58-2.26).
3:::In all, 42 per cent of 186 sides were affected by frontal sinusitis. Agger nasi, ethmoid bulla, fronto-ethmoidal, suprabullar and frontal bulla cells were identified in 99 per cent, 100 per cent, 38 per cent, 69 per cent, and 16 per cent of sides, respectively. The presence of frontal recess cells and frontal ostium size did not significantly influence frontal sinusitis development. However, opacification of agger nasi, type 1 fronto-ethmoidal and suprabullar cells significantly influenced frontal sinusitis development.
3:::The treatment with LG-βCD, especially in the dose of 24mg/kg, was able to significantly decrease (p<0.05) the paw withdrawal and muscle threshold. Furthermore, LG-βCD was shown to affect the opioidergic and serotonergic pathways. There were no significant changes in muscle strength. Fos protein immunofluorescence showed a significant decrease in expression in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The main compounds of LG showed through the docking study interaction energies with the alpha-adrenergic and μOpioid receptors. In all antioxidant assays, LG exhibited stronger antioxidant activities than LG-βCD.
3:::For VAS, administrative coverage was higher than survey estimates in 47 of 52 (90%) campaign rounds, with a mean difference of 16.1% (95% CI: 9.5-22.7; P < 0.001). For deworming, administrative coverage exceeded survey estimates in 31 of 34 (91%) comparisons, with a mean difference of 29.8% (95% CI: 16.9-42.6; P < 0.001). Mean ± SD differences in coverage between administrative and survey data were 12.2% ± 22.5% for the door-to-door delivery strategy and 25.9% ± 24.7% for the fixed-site model (P = 0.06). For deworming, mean ± SD differences in coverage between data sources were 28.1% ± 43.5% and 33.1% ± 17.9% for door-to-door and fixed-site distribution, respectively (P = 0.64). VAS administrative coverage was higher than survey estimates in 37 of 49 (76%) comparisons for the 6- to 11-month age group and 45 of 48 (94%) comparisons for the 12- to 59-month age group.
3:::Vegetable consumption from plates was significantly higher during the intervention period (M = 115.5 g) than during the control period (M = 61.7 g). Similarly, total vegetable consumption (including side dishes) was significantly higher during the intervention period (M = 178.0 g) than during the control period (M = 137.0 g). Conversely, meat consumption was significantly lower during the intervention period (M = 183.1 g) than during the control period (M = 211.1 g). Satisfaction with the restaurant visit did not differ between the intervention period (M = 1.27) and control period (M = 1.35). Satisfaction with the main dish was significantly lower during the intervention period (M = 1.25) than during the control period (M = 1.38), although in both cases, the scores indicated that participants remained (very) satisfied with their main dish.
3:::We identified 7 studies (all were published since 2014) that enrolled 9755 participants (median=136 [range 40 to 9042]). Studies mainly used Facebook (n=4) or Twitter (n=2), and emerged as feasible and acceptable. Five studies reported smoking-related outcomes such as greater abstinence, reduction in relapse, and an increase in quit attempts. Most studies (n=6) recruited participants using online or Facebook advertisements. Tailored content, targeted reminders, and moderated discussions were used to promote participant engagement. Three studies found that active participation through posting comments or liking content may be associated with improved outcomes. Retention ranged from 35% to 84% (median=70%) across the included studies.
3:::Obese pigs showed hyperglycemia, high triglycerides, and insulin resistance. Adiponectin levels were significantly decreased (p<0.05) and IL-6 amounts dramatically increased (p<0.05) in obese pigs both in serum and adipose tissue, corroborating data from obese mice and humans. However, circulating resistin and TNF-α showed no difference, while the values of TNF-α in adipose tissue were significantly higher in obese pigs, also in agreement with data from obese humans but not rodent models. Moreover, strong associations of skeletal muscle AMPK phosphorylation with plasma adiponectin and HOMA-IR index were obtained.
3:::In the period from March 2009 until February 2015, 96 patients were transplanted within this program. The mean recipient age was 49 years and 57% were females, 30% of the patients were first transplants and of these 93% were females. The majority of the patients had 2-5 HLA-A, -B. -DR mismatches. The allograft survival at 60 months was 79.1%. Applying the TS to the cohort confirmed that patients with a low TS score had longer waiting times.
3:::From June 2014 to January 2016, 133 patients were enrolled and 121 were retained in the intent-to-treat analysis; 12 deemed ineligible after random assignment were not subsequently followed. Most of the patients (95.1%) had stage III or IV disease. The median follow-up was nine months. The median OS was 19.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] = 12.5 to noncalculable) in the experimental and 12.0 months (95% CI = 8.6 to 16.4) in the control arm (one-sided P = .001) (hazard ratio = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.15 to 0.67, one-sided P = .002). The performance status at first detected relapse was 0 to 1 for 75.9% of the patients in the experimental arm and for 32.5% of those in the control arm (two-sided P < .001). Optimal treatment was initiated in 72.4% of the patients in the experimental arm and in 32.5% of those in the control arm (two-sided P < .001).
3:::We show that ""IP"" doses more effectively shrink large spheroids when the same cumulative dose is administered with both treatments, but that both regimens similarly treat small spheroids. We also demonstrate that higher cumulative ""device"" doses are most effective at shrinking large spheroids.
3:::An open chest wound with HPTX raised IP pressure (~ -0.7 mm Hg) and caused labored breathing and reductions in PaO2 and SvO2 (p < 0.01). Sealing the wounds with the CSs restored IP pressure, and improved breathing and oxygenation. Subsequent blood infusion into the wound and IP air injections produced CS-dependent responses. Chest seals with one-way valves (Bolin and SAM) did not evacuate the blood efficiently; pooled blood either detached the CSs from skin and leaked out (75%), or clotted and clogged the valve and led to tension HPTX (25%). Conversely, CSs with laminar venting channels allowed escape of blood and air from the pleural cavity and maintained IP pressure and oxygenation near normal levels. Success rates were 100% for Sentinel and Russell (6/6); 67% for HyFin (4/6); 25% for SAM (1/4); and 0% for Bolin (0/4) CSs (p = 0.002).
3:::We evaluated 37 patients (18 men; median age, 70 years) with NSCLC. For this group, the geometric mean proportion of cells coexpressing CD44/CD90 was 0.52%. Expression of CD44/CD90 was significantly elevated (24.4%, geometric mean) in 6 patients. The median relapse-free survival for patients with high CD44/CD90 coexpression was 7.7 months (95% confidence interval, 4.2 to 11.7) compared with 40 months (95% confidence interval, 18.2 to 77.8) for the group with low CD44/CD90 coexpression (p = 0.00006 by Mantel log-rank test). The assessment of risk based upon CD44/CD90 expression status was not correlated with pathologic staging (p = 0.073 by χ(2)).
3:::Usual endpoints actually recommended for drug development suffer from important flaws. Mortality requires large sample size and only partly related to the infectious process. Clinical cure rate is highly subjective in critically ill patients where symptoms may be related to other intercurrent events. Currently, composite endpoints, hierarchical nested designs, and competing risks analysis seem to be the most promising new tools for designing and analyzing clinical trials in this area, although they require further validation.
3:::The extract inhibits the proliferation of both P388 cells and MNCBMs, with IC50 values of 927 and 1911 μg/mL, respectively, but reduced the viability and induced the apoptosis of only leukemia cells. The LD50 was higher than 5000 mg/kg, and this concentration did not alter the blood chemistry or cell count but doubled the mitotic index in the bone marrow. The HPLC showed the presence of cucurbitacins, phloridzin, naringenin, phloretin, apigenin, and gallic, chlorogenic, vanillic, p-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, and p-coumaric acids.
3:::All cells expressed EC markers vWF and CD31. Using rotational seeding for a period of 16-24 h, ECs attached firmly to the stents with sufficient coverage to form a confluent EC monolayer. The grooved SS wire design was found to enable attachment of three times the number of cells compared to smooth wires. This also resulted in an increased number of cells remaining on the stent after deployment and after pulsatile flow of 180 ml/min for 24 h, which did not result in additional EC detachment.
3:::The most common causes of AKI were sepsis (39.3%) and cardiac events (32%). The majority of patients were treated by continuous (67.3%), the others by intermittent RRT. After 30 days, 51.0% of patients survived. Nonsurvivors were older (73 vs. 69 years), had a higher APACHEE II score (30.1 ± 5.6 vs. 26.5 ± 7.1), and were more likely to be vasopressor dependent, mechanically ventilated, or treated by continuous RRT. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher age, higher APACHEE II score, and lower serum creatinine at baseline were independent predictors for mortality, whereas histories of diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, or stroke were not.
3:::Double-leg interval and continuous cycling were performed at greater absolute power outputs but lower normalized power outputs compared to single-leg cycling (p < 0.001). The average EMG responses from the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis were similar across modes (p > 0.05), but semitendinosus was activated to a greater extent for single-leg cycling (p = 0.005). Single-leg interval and continuous cycling elicited lower mean [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], HR and ratings of perceived exertion compared to double-leg cycling (p < 0.05).
3:::Of the 24 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, 17 reported reductions in depressive symptoms. Social interventions often incorporated multiple strategies to improve depressive symptoms, including: peer support (n=17), skill building (n=11), group-based activities (n =11), psycho-education (n =9), psychotherapy (n =5), exercise (n =5), and links to community resources (n=3).
3:::SPECT images of acceptable quality and covering the range from skull vertex to mid-femur were acquired in 33 min. Audit indicated that SPECT identified clinically significant lesions not reported from planar views and improved lesion localization and reporter confidence.
3:::Females exposed to emotional abuse (OR=2.7; 95%CI=1.9, 3.8) and domestic violence (OR=1.9; 95%CI=1.2, 2.9) were at increased risk for depression after adjustment for confounders and other types of maltreatment. Females exposed to two or more forms of maltreatment were at particularly high risk for depression (OR=4.1; 95%Cl=2.8, 6.1) compared with females not exposed to maltreatment. In adjusted analyses, maltreatment was not associated with depression for males.
3:::In the stress-first protocol, the dose ratio 1 : 5 was enough to show the same regional percentage uptake compared with the reference. However, in the rest-first protocol, the regional percentage uptakes were higher than those of the reference image even with a 1 : 6 dose ratio.
3:::Patients showed thinning of Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) relative to control subjects in most of the OCT parameters including Right average (p<.001 and 95% CI [14.39, 19.84]), Lt average (p<.001 and 95% CI [13.03, 19.42]). Patients also showed decreased Ganglionic Cell Complex (GCC) significantly in Rt average (p=.002 and 95% CI [2.33, 9.78]), Lt average (p<.001) and 95% CI [4.47, 11.63]. Age at onset, number of episodes, and severity did not significantly correlate with OCT parameters.
3:::A total of 21 patients with positive anti-HCV antibody tests received chemotherapy. The median patient age was 46.3 ± 11.2 years. Four (19.0%) patients exhibited abnormal liver function at baseline. The morbidity of abnormal liver function at baseline was higher in HCV-infected patients (19.0% vs. 0, P = 0.000). Four patients received trastuzumab therapy. Five (23.8%) patients who received chemotherapy developed hepatitis. No patients presented with HCV reactivation. The morbidity of hepatitis and the rate of disruption of chemotherapy were not significantly different between breast cancer patients without HCV infection and those with HCV infection (23.8 vs. 14.2% P = 0.342, 9.5 vs. 5.0% P = 0.619, respectively).
3:::At the last follow-up examination (3 years or longer after MALK), corrected distance visual acuity had improved to 20/20, refractive astigmatism had decreased to an average of 2.1 D (in all cases within 4.5 D), and the average surface asymmetry index had reduced from 2.27 to 0.56.
3:::The study recorded 68,390 patients; 93.8% were from the public hospitals. There were seven male for every three female patients, and 50% were 20-39 years of age. About 69.3% were unintentional injuries. Among injuries with a known mechanism (19,102), 51.1% were road traffic injuries (RTIs) and 17.5% were falls. Female, patients aged 60 years or older, patients transferred by ambulance, patients who had RTIs, and patients with intentional injuries were more likely to be hospitalized.
3:::One hundred and thirty-two tear samples were collected from a total of 61 cases (15 severe and 46 mild-moderate) and 22 controls. IL-8, part of the Toll-like receptor 4 cytokine cascade, was found to be expressed at a detectable level more often in cases of AK than in control CL wearers (P = 0.003) and in higher concentrations in severe cases than in milder forms of the disease (z = -2.35). IL-22, part of the IL-10 family, and a proinflammatory Th17 cytokine, was detected more often in severe cases than in milder forms of AK (P < 0.02).
3:::Cocaine craving was successfully induced, with no significant difference in cue-induced craving between the two groups. However, post-hoc analyses revealed a significant increase in pre-video cocaine craving scores over time among individuals with cannabis use disorders.
3:::Before study entry, participants had received EN for a mean of 6.6 years at a mean volume of approximately 800 mL, yet had a mean body mass index of only 17.5 kg/m and omega-3 FA plasma concentrations were only 60% of levels found in normal healthy subjects. Compared with placebo, cartridge use resulted in a statistically significant 2.8-fold increase in plasma omega-3 FA concentrations. There were no adverse experiences associated with cartridge use, and a decrease in the frequency and severity of most symptoms of malabsorption was observed with cartridge use. Participants reported increased preservation of appetite and breakfast consumption with cartridge use compared with their pre-study regimen.
3:::At end-of-treatment radiological restaging, 13% of patients were found to have partial response and 64% to have stable disease; 23% of patients progressed through treatment. Overall, 47% of patients demonstrated a reduction in chromogranin A levels. The overall estimated median time to progression from the start of treatment was 28 months for the entire cohort and 31, 30 and 5 months for those with partial response, stable disease and progressive disease, respectively. On multivariate regression analysis, higher grade of tumour was found to be significantly associated with shorter progression-free survival. Three patients experienced grade 1 haematotoxicity, five grade 1 nephrotoxicity and one grade 2 nephrotoxicity.
3:::The CAG area measured 17.9% smaller than the laser settings (P = 0.03). Central (75.6 ± 13.7 μm) and peripheral (77.7 ± 13.2 μm) CAG thickness did not differ significantly (P = 0.3). No buttonholes or CAG tags occurred. The mean dissection time was 19.5 ± 1.2 seconds, and the time to remove the FSL-prepared CAG and to unfold it onto the cornea was 10.3 ± 3.8 seconds. During 35.8 ± 38.0 days of follow-up, no postoperative complication or recurrences occurred. The conjunctival epithelium had healed at the CAG resection site within 1 week with no evidence of scarring.
3:::There was no correlation between dental score and rideability score prior to treatment (rs = 0.06, P = 0.73). In addition, there were no differences in the rideability score between treatment groups or as an interaction of treatment group and time (P = 0.93, P = 0.83, respectively).
3:::Patients with SCZ took fewer draws to decision (DTD) than HCs (t(57)=2.78, p=0.007). Oxytocin did not significantly change DTD in patients (t(42)=-1.11, p=0.27), nor in HCs (t(15)=-0.62, p=0.55). Exploratory analyses found ventral caudate volumes were negatively correlated with DTD (r(18)=-0.50, p=0.03) in patients. Moreover, oxytocin was more likely to improve JTC in patients with lower baseline SF. However, these exploratory findings did not survive correction for multiple comparisons.
3:::Incidence of complications from diabetes and death declined over the observation period in patients at varying disease duration. Among the high-risk group with diabetes for at least 15 years, crude incidence of AMI decreased from 8.7 to 5.8, stroke from 13.5 to 10.1, ESRD from 25.8 to 22.5, and death from 29.0 to 26.6 per 1,000 person-year between the periods 2000 to 2002 and 2010 to 2012. Improvements in levels of metabolic risk factors were detected. Proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) was increased from 32.9 to 50.0%, blood pressure ≤130/80 mmHg from 24.7 to 30.7%, and LDL cholesterol <2.6 mmol/L from 25.8 to 38.1%.
3:::Copayments for home health visits ranged from $5 to $20 per visit, which were estimated to be associated with $165 (interquartile range [IQR], $45-$180) to $660 (IQR, $180-$720) in out-of-pocket spending for the average user of home health care. The increased copayment for home health care was not associated with the proportion of enrollees receiving home health care (adjusted difference-in-differences, -0.15 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.38 to 0.09), the number of home health episodes per user (adjusted difference-in-differences, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.03), and home health days per user (adjusted difference-in-differences, -0.19; 95% CI, -3.02 to 2.64). In both intervention and control plans and across all levels of copayments, we observed higher disenrollment rates among enrollees with greater baseline use of home health care.
3:::A two-factor model fit the data, with factors reflecting dimensions of affiliation/rejection and distress/non-distress. Two items that did not load robustly on either factor had face validity for hopefulness and hopelessness and were combined as a measure along a hopefulness/hopelessness dimension. The interaction Distress×Hopefulness, reflecting a conflicting emotional response pattern, significantly predicted post-discharge suicide outcomes even after covarying for depression, entrapment, and suicidal ideation severity.
3:::In the 107 healthy mother and infant pairs (median age at the time of specimen collection, 40 days; range, 1-331 days), 52 (43.0%) of the infants were male. Bacterial communities were distinct in milk, areolar skin, and stool, differing in both composition and diversity. The infant gut microbial communities were more closely related to an infants mother's milk and skin compared with a random mother (mean difference in Bray-Curtis distances, 0.012 and 0.014, respectively; P < .001 for both). Source tracking analysis was used to estimate the contribution of the breast milk and areolar skin microbiomes to the infant gut microbiome. During the first 30 days of life, infants who breastfed to obtain 75% or more of their daily milk intake received a mean (SD) of 27.7% (15.2%) of the bacteria from breast milk and 10.3% (6.0%) from areolar skin. Bacterial diversity (Faith phylogenetic diversity, P = .003) and composition changes were associated with the proportion of daily breast milk intake in a dose-dependent manner, even after the introduction of solid foods.'
3:::The major causes of visual impairment during the ten-year period were glaucoma (23.3%), diabetic retinopathy (17.3%), retinitis pigmentosa (12.2%), macular degeneration (9.0%), chorioretinal degeneration or high myopia (7.4%), optic atrophy (5.8%), stroke or brain tumor (5.4%) and cataracts (3.7%). The incidence of glaucoma was significantly higher throughout the period (2004-2013), and that of diabetic retinopathy was lower between 2007 and 2013. The incidence of retinitis pigmentosa did not change significantly during the 10-year period. The incidence of macular degeneration tended to increase between 2004 and 2007, but it decreased significantly between 2007 and 2013.
3:::Expression of mRNA encoding the pro-fibrotic factors; axin 2, collagen III, β-catenin and fibronectin, were all significantly higher (all p < 0.05) in the older participants (350, 170, 298, and 641%, respectively). Furthermore, axin 2 and β-catenin mRNA were significantly higher in older females than older males (p < 0.05). Gene expression of ActRIIB, myostatin, and TGF-β1 were higher in older adults compared to younger adults (all p < 0.05). There was, however, no difference in the total protein content of myostatin, myoD or myogenin (all p > 0.05), whereas Smad3 protein phosphorylation was 48% lower (p < 0.05) in muscle from older adults.
3:::The Ames Minilet™ Lancet device was found to perform by far the worst compared to the five device underexamination: it required the highest number of sticks (mean=3.91; 95% CI: 3.46-4.36), evoked the most intense pain (mean=3.98; 95% CI: 3.77-4.20), and most frequently necessitated squeezing the heel (92.9%; 95% CI: 86.9-96.3). The five devices under examination appeared to be similar in terms of the number of sticks required, but differed slightly in NIPS score and in need to squeeze the heel.
3:::Among 121 130 enumerated household members, 101 102 (83.5%) accepted the intervention. HCT uptake was 72.2% (66 894/92 612), similar by sex but varied across communities. HCT uptake was associated with younger age, sex, community, being symptomatic for TB and sexually transmitted infections and longer time since previous HIV test. Knowledge of HIV status due to the intervention increased by 36% overall and by 66% among HIV positive participants; the highest impact was among 18-24 years old.
3:::Between 2002 and 2012, 129,914 admissions were included. Six hundred and thirty (0.48%) patients died during their hospital stay. There was an increase in the number of HTNE admissions (9,511-15,479; Ptrend < 0.001) with concurrent reduction of in-hospital mortality (0.8-0.3%; Ptrend < 0.001) by the year 2012 compared to 2002. Patients who died during hospitalization were older, had longer length of stay, higher cost of stay, more comorbidities, and higher risk scores. Presence of acute cardiorespiratory failure [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 15.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 13.2-18.9], stroke or transient ischemia attack (TIA) (adjusted OR, 7.9; 95% CI, 6.3-9.9), chest pain (adjusted OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 4.4-7.7), stroke/TIA (adjusted OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 4.5-7.7), and aortic dissection (adjusted OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.8-12.4) were most predictive of higher in-hospital mortality in addition to factors such as age, aortic dissection, acute myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, and presence of neurological symptoms.
3:::For displaced fractures, implant survival after total hip arthroplasty was significantly lower compared to hemiarthroplasty. For nondisplaced fractures, implant survival of cannulated screws was significantly lower compared to sliding hip screws. Overall patient survival for males with alcohol dependence syndrome with hip fracture was 62% at 1 year and 49% at 2 years. Patient survival in this population did not differ between displaced and nondisplaced fractures or among different surgical methods.
3:::A total of 316 women were included, with a mean age (SD) of 45.4 (11.4) years. Of these, 94.9% had stage information: 5 (1.7%), 92 (30.7%), 157 (52.4%) and 46 (15.3%) were diagnosed at stages I, II, III and IV, respectively. In multivariate analyses, lower educational level (odds ratio (OR) 2.35, 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 5.29), not believing in a cure for breast cancer (1.81: 1.09, 3.01), and living in a rural area (2.18: 1.05, 4.51) were strongly associated with later stage, whilst age at diagnosis, tumour grade and oestrogen receptor status were not. Being Muslim (vs. Christian) was associated with lower odds of later stage disease (0.46: 0.22, 0.94).
3:::Abnormalities in UES pressures and relaxation were found in about one-third of patients in all groups. There were no significant differences between the groups. Group B had higher prevalence of abnormal esophageal motility compared to others (group A vs. B vs. C = 20.8% vs. 28% vs. 12.5%, p = .029). Group B patients also had higher prevalence of Barretts esophagus compared to others (group A vs. B vs. C = 0% vs.12.2% vs. 4.6%, p = .01). Distal pH testing revealed no significant differences between the three groups.'
3:::Patients who died during hospitalization had higher mean PP compared to survivors (68.5 ± 16.4 mm Hg vs. 65.4 ± 12.4 mm Hg; P = 0.032). The following admission variables were associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality (P < 0.001): poorer admission clinical condition, intraventricular hemorrhage, and increased admission normalized hematoma volume. ROC analysis showed that mean PP dichotomized at 72.17 mm Hg, provided a transition point that maximized sensitivity and specific for mortality. The association of this increased dichotomized PP with higher in-hospital mortality was maintained in multivariable logistic regression analysis (odds ratio, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-5.3; P < 0.001) adjusting for potential confounders.
3:::Ten (4.8%) samples had a nonreactive or weakly-reactive rapid test result (7/180 early ART arm, 3/27 delayed ART arm, P = 0.13); one sample had nonreactive fourth-generation assay results and 3 had indeterminate WBs. Forty (18.9%) samples had a false-recent incidence assay result; 16 (7.8%) had false-recent results with both incidence assays. Baseline samples had stronger rapid test and WB bands, higher fourth-generation assay signal-to-cutoff values, and fewer HIV incidence assay results indicative of recent infection.
3:::Three hundred and ten patients were included in this study. Discordance between local and central pathology opinion of tumor histology and tumor grade was observed in 98 (32%) and 122 (39%) cases, respectively. In multivariate analysis, liposarcoma patients had improved tumor response compared to other histological subgroups, whilst patients with metastases other than lung, liver or bone had a poorer response [odds ratio (OR) 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.78; p = 0.006]. Patients with bone metastases had reduced OS [hazard ratio (HR) 1.56, 95% CI 1.16-2.09; p = 0.003]. By central pathology review, patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) had improved tumor response and OS with doxorubicin-ifosfamide compared to single-agent doxorubicin (OR 9.90, 95% CI 1.93-50.7 and HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.79, respectively). Grade III tumors had improved response with combination chemotherapy but there was no interaction between chemotherapy and grade on OS.
3:::SR threshold for increasing GSC on back was significantly higher than that of forearm (P < 0.05) without any sex differences (back 0.70 ± 0.08 and 0.61 ± 0.04, forearm 0.40 ± 0.05 and 0.45 ± 0.06 mg/cm(2)/min for males and females, respectively). Distance runners and sprinters showed higher SR threshold for increasing GSC than that of untrained subjects on back (P < 0.05) but not on forearm (back 0.45 ± 0.06, 0.83 ± 0.06, and 0.70 ± 0.04, forearm 0.33 ± 0.04, 0.49 ± 0.02, and 0.39 ± 0.07 mg/cm(2)/min for untrained subjects, distance runners, and sprinters, respectively).
3:::Seventy-three MC patients (50 collagenous colitis and 23 lymphocytic colitis) with a median disease duration of 24 months (range, 7-60) were included. The indications for treatment were budesonide-refractoriness in 66%, budesonide dependence in 29%, and budesonide intolerance in 5%. Median age was 51.8 years (range, 43.4-63.1) and 61 (84%) were female. Thiopurines were used in 49 patients (67%) for a median of 4 months (range, 1.5-15). Complete and partial response occurred in 43% and 22% respectively. Adverse effects resulting in therapy cessation occurred in 17 patients (35%). Twelve patients (16%) were treated with methotrexate for a median of 14 months (3-18.8). Complete and partial response occurred in 58% and 17%, respectively. Anti-TNF therapy was used in 10 patients (14%) for a median of 4 months (range, 2.3-5.5). Complete response occurred in four patients and partial response in four patients.
3:::The qPCR assay was highly reproducible (Ct plasmid and genomic targets mean total coefficients of variance 41.5% and 48.3%, respectively). The assay detected 8/8 core specimens upon testing of a quality control panel and performed well in comparison to commercially marketed comparator test (sensitivity and specificity>90%). Optimal extraction and sample preservation methods for research applications were identified.
3:::SYD985 and T-DM1 induced similar ADCC in the presence of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) against EOC cell lines with differential HER2/neu expression. In contrast, SYD985 was 3 to 42 fold more cytotoxic in the absence of PBL when compared to T-DM1 (p<0.0001). Unlike T-DM1, SYD985 induced efficient bystander killing of HER2/neu 0/1+ tumor cells when admixed with HER2/neu 3+ EOC cells. In vivo studies confirmed that SYD985 is significantly more active than T-DM1 against HER2/neu 3+ EOC xenografts.
3:::The HGI and G-gap were highly correlated according GA (r=0.722, P<0.001). In general, the two indices were similar in terms of both direction and magnitude. The classification of patients as high, moderate, or low glycators based on HGI versus G-gap was consistent for the majority of the population and only 5% of patients were reclassified from high to low or low to high. Fasting C-peptide levels decreased linearly, and the percentage of patients using insulin increased linearly, between the lowest and highest HGI tertile (both P<0.05).
3:::TTE revealed that NS1619 improved ejection fraction one week (Con: 36±4%, NS: 45±4%; P<0.05) and four weeks after I/R (Con: 33±11%, NS: 46±8%; P<0.05). Preconditioning with NS1619 reduced end-diastolic volume at both time points (TTEW1: Con: 60±12μl, NS: 45±8μl; TTEW4: Con: 82±31μl, NS: 44±8μl; each P<0.05) and increased fractional shortening after four weeks (TTEW4: Con: 12±6%, NS: 24±8%; P<0.05). MRI-analysis after four weeks confirmed the echocardiographic results. NS1619 increased ejection fraction by 45% (MRI: Con: 29±6%, NS: 42±9%; P<0.05 vs. Con) and reduced end-diastolic and -systolic volume (EDV, ESV) compared to control (MRI: EDV: Con: 110±19μl, NS: 88±16μl; ESV: Con: 79±19μl, NS: 53±18μl; each P<0.05). Preconditioning reduced infarction scar after four weeks by 25% (Con: 12±3%, NS: 9±2%; P<0.05).
3:::Among all women giving birth, the proportion with a disability increased from 0.27% in 2000 to 0.80% in 2010. Women with disabilities had significantly elevated odds of primary cesarean delivery in each year, but the magnitude of the odds ratio decreased over time from 2.60 (95% CI = 2.25 = 2.99) in 2000 to 1.66 (95% CI = 1.51-1.81) in 2010.
3:::Regarding vasomotor responses to acetylcholine infusion, there were significant vasoconstrictions to maximal acetylcholine infusion in the clopidogrel and prasugrel group compared with those in the ticagrelor group. The mean neointimal area were significantly lower in the ticagrelor group (1.0±0.3 by OCT, 0.9±0.3 by histology), than in the clopidogrel (1.8±0.7, p=0.003, 1.6±0.8, p=0.030) and prasugrel (1.8±0.5, p=0.001, 1.5±0.5, p=0.019) groups. Percentages of moderate to dense peri-strut inflammatory cell infiltration were significantly lower in the ticagrelor group (9.0%) compared with the clopidogrel (17.3%, p<0.001) and prasugrel groups (15.7%, p=0.002). There were no significant differences in all findings between clopidogrel and prasugrel groups.
3:::A total of 93 peptides were detected. 24, 20, 23, and 2 peptides showed at least 1.2-fold difference in ion intensity between the psoriasis (PV+PsA) and HC groups, between the PV+PsA and AD groups, between the PV and PsA groups, and between patients with severe-to-moderate PV (n=6) and those with mild PV (n=18), respectively (p<0.05). 13 out of 27 peptides that showed at least 1.5-fold ion intensity difference in the abovementioned 4 comparisons were identified. The parent proteins of the identified peptides included a coagulation factor, proteins involved in the maintenance of skin, and a protein relating to cytoskeleton. We focused on 2 peptides that were increased in the PV+PsA group: a fibrinogen α chain-derived peptide (1462m/z), the unmodified form of which was fibrinopeptide A-des-alanine (FPAdA), and a filaggrin (FLG)-derived peptide (1977m/z), a modified form of FLG2099-2118 (Q2099pE, Q2115E; FLG-pEE). FPAdA stimulation increased the secretion of GROα from dermal microvascular endothelial cells (dMVECs) and decreased the secretion of lipocalin-2 from keratinocytes in comparison to FPAdA-resequenced peptide stimulation (GROα, 280.9±7.3pg/mL vs. 229.6±5.0pg/mL, p<0.001; lipocalin-2, 273±13pg/mL vs. 350±10pg/mL, p<0.01). Interestingly, FLG-pEE stimulation decreased the secretion of GROα, IL-8, and MCP-1 from dMVECs in comparison to FLG-derived control peptide stimulation (GROα, 844.3±47.5pg/mL vs. 1038.5±96.9pg/mL, p<0.05; IL-8, 2240.1±172.6pg/mL vs. 3221.8±523.7pg/mL, p<0.05; MCP-1, 4057.8±157.2pg/mL vs. 4619.1±213.4pg/mL, p<0.05).
3:::Greater diabetes strengths were significantly related to resilient outcomes: more frequent SMBG (r = 0.39), lower HbA1c (r = -0.31), and higher general QOL (r = 0.50), as well as to lower risks: fewer depressive (r = -0.45) and anxiety (r = -0.40) symptoms and less conflict (r = 0.28). In multivariate regressions, diabetes strengths consistently related to all resilient outcomes beyond significant risk factors.
3:::Pathogens were detected in 71% of patients, and identified as the source of infection in 52% (104/200). The majority of patients suffered from Streptococcus pneumoniae (32/200), Haemophilus influenzae (22/200), and Moraxella catarrhalis (16/200). Gram stain guided pathogen-oriented therapy decisions for 38 of 96 patients with unknown pathogens. Atypical pathogens were only diagnosed in CAP patients (n = 5). Severity of pneumonia was related to male sex (p = 0.006), and preexisting conditions, such as chronic heart failure (p < 0.001) and COPD (p < 0.001). Risk factors associated with increased length of stay included chronic heart failure, chronic renal failure, other pulmonary diseases and diabetes. Mortality for NHCAP patients was associated with lung cancer and bronchiectasis. CAP patients were more frequently admitted during winter months, while NHCAP patients were admitted during all other seasons. Seasonal patterns for individual pathogens could not be determined.
3:::Eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. The overall effect in percent mammographic density was -1.41 (CI -2.86 to 0.05; P=0.06) in the recessive model. Exclusion of breast cancer patients increased the effect size to -1.93 (CI -3.49 to -0.37; P=0.02). The results suggested opposite effect of COMT Val158Met for postmenopausal users of HRT versus premenopausal women or postmenopausal non-users of HRT.
3:::Most had a strong desire for motherhood, although there were varied decisions and some ambivalence over whether or not to attempt pregnancy. Decisions were influenced by an interplay of biomedical, social and personal factors that shaped assessments of three key areas of consideration: importance, feasibility, and costs of pregnancy/motherhood.
3:::Patients with pneumococcal and meningococcal meningitis showed a similar male/female ratio, mean age, and duration of symptoms. There were no statistically significant differences in biochemical markers between the two groups. All patients possessed at least one polymorphic variant of the analyzed SNPs. The most common SNP was TLR9 rs352140, detected in 89.7% of patients. No significant differences in SNP frequency were found between patients, family members, and the general population.
3:::Between 1990 and 2010, an estimated 263 338 children aged <18 years were treated for CTA-related ear injuries in US hospital EDs. There was a nonsignificant increase in the annual number of injuries from 1990 through 2001 (78.2%) and a significant decrease from 2001 through 2010 (26.0%). Younger children sustained the highest rate of injury (32.2 per 100 000 for age 0-3 years). Ear cleaning was the most frequently documented circumstance at the time of injury (73.2%), and patients themselves were most commonly handling the CTA (76.9%). Foreign body sensation (39.2%) and bleeding (34.8%) were commonly documented reasons for visiting the ED. The presence of a foreign body (29.7%) and tympanic membrane perforation (25.3%) were common diagnoses.
3:::There were no significant group differences in the QLI at baseline and follow-up. However, 33%, 24% and 43% of persons exhibited > 0.5 effect size increase or decrease, or no change, respectively. In multivariable analysis, there were 5 baseline predictors of QLI at follow-up: QLI, Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) scores, religiousness, perceived well-being versus others/past self, and time from initial interview. Baseline QLI predicted 5 variables at follow-up: the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) anxiety score, PANSS positive score, CES-D score, insight, and perceived well-being versus others/past self.
3:::Type 1 diabetes was identified in 504 children during follow-up, and the incidence of type 1 diabetes per 100,000 person-years was 30.5 in the Norwegian cohort and 23.5 in the Danish cohort. Children who were never breastfed had a twofold increased risk of type 1 diabetes compared with those who were breastfed (HR 2.29 [95% CI 1.14-4.61] for no breastfeeding vs. any breastfeeding for ≥12 months). Among those who were breastfed, however, the incidence of type 1 diabetes was independent of duration of both full breastfeeding (HR per month 0.99 [95% CI 0.97-1.01]) and any breastfeeding (0.97 [0.92-1.03]).
3:::Among 1,257,279 long-stay residents, 40,932 (3.2%) met the definition of hip fracture using Part A claims, and 41,687 residents (3.3%) met the definition using Part B claims. 4566 hip fractures identified using Part B claims would not have been captured using Part A claims. An additional 227 hip fractures were identified after considering contiguous fracture sites.
3:::The mean CSA in the control group in neutral, internal, and external rotations was 34°, 33°, and 33°, respectively. The corresponding values in the study group were 33°, 33°, and 33° (<0.01). The interclass correlation coefficient between the two examiners was 0.917 (P < 0.01), 0.924 (P < 0.01), and 0.948 (P < 0.01), respectively. The Mann-Whitney test between the control group and the study group were, respectively, 0.907, 0.932, and 0.602.
3:::Estrogen receptor α and PRB were mainly expressed in the stroma but not in the carcinoma tissues of the cervical cancer, and their expressions were highly correlated. More stromal ERαs were found in early-stage tumors than in advanced-stage tumors. Greater stromal expressions of ERα and PRB were associated with a more favorable prognosis (P = 0.018 and P = 0.004, respectively). The expressions were not related to the differentiation of cancer, the status of HPV infection, the HPV load, or the genotype. In multivariate analysis, stromal ERα and PRB expressions were independently associated with a lower risk of mortality. The adjusted hazard ratios of mortality for low and high expressions of ERα were 0.19 (95% confidential interval [95% CI], 0.04-0.87) and 0.15 (95% CI, 0.03-0.81), respectively, whereas for low and high expressions of PRB hazard ratios were 0.46 (95% CI, 0.19-1.16) and 0.24 (95% CI, 0.06-0.96), respectively.
3:::The proposed channel-independent method improves AUC by 4-5% over existing methods (p < 0.001, n=36), with median (95% confidence interval) AUC of 0.989 (0.973-0.997) and sensitivity-specificity of 95.8-94.4%. Agreement rates between the detector and experts annotations, κ=0.72 (0.36-0.83) and κ=0.65 (0.32-0.81), are comparable to inter-rater agreement, κ=0.60 (0.21-0.74).'
3:::The CGL could be identified in 56%/54% of MRI and in 76%/77% of MRA examinations. On MRA, the CGL was detected as distinct structures in 37%/35% of cases and it appeared fused (partially or totally) with the SGHL and/or CHL in 39%/42%; it was absent in 12%/12% and it appears undistinguishable in the remaining cases. The interobserver agreement was excellent (κ = 0.98 for detection on MRI; p = 0.927 for classification of anterosuperior anatomy on MRA; κ = 0.873 and 0.978 for identification on sagittal and axial external rotation MRA respectively; κ = 0.943 for classification as intra- or extra-articular on MRA).
3:::Global mean cortical thickness was lower in the overweight/obese type 2 diabetes group than in the normal-weight type 2 diabetes group (z = -2.96, p for group effect = 0.003). A negative correlation was observed between disease duration and global mean white matter integrity (z = 2.42, p for interaction = 0.02) in the overweight/obese type 2 diabetes group, but not in the normal-weight type 2 diabetes group. Overweight/obese individuals with type 2 diabetes showed a decrease in psychomotor speed performance related to disease duration (z = -2.12, p for interaction = 0.03), while normal-weight participants did not.
3:::No difference was found between groups for mean [Formula: see text] (HIIT: 2.84 ± 0.46 L min(-1); CONT: 2.72 ± 0.43 L min(-1)) and EE per minute (HIIT: 14.36 ± 2.34 kcal min(-1); CONT: 13.21 ± 2.08 kcal min(-1)) during protocols. Regarding total EE during session, CONT resulted in higher values compared to HIIT (390.45 ± 65.15; 55.20 ± 9.33 kcal, respectively). However, post-exercise EE and EPOC values were higher after HIIT (69.31 ± 10.88; 26.27 ± 2.28 kcal, respectively) compared to CONT (55.99 ± 10.20; 13.43 ± 10.45 kcal, respectively).
3:::Cumulative proportions of 5-year survival were 67% for 0 risk factors, 58% for 1 risk factor and 41% for 2 risk factors (P < 0.0001). The overall 5-year mortality risk was significantly higher in patients with 1 risk factor (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.43 [95% CI 1.14-1.79]), or 2 risk factors (aHR 2.49 [95% CI 1.99-3.11]). A significant impact on survival was observed in each tumour-node-metastasis stage group, and in the subset of non-smokers. Postoperative 30-day mortality was significantly higher in patients with 2 risk factors only (aHR 2.2% versus 0.6%, p < 0.0475).
3:::A total of 10 084 trifocal IOLs were bilaterally implanted (5802 FineVision in 2901 patients and 4282 AT Lisa in 2141 patients). Three-month mean (± standard deviation) acuity: AT Lisa, binocular uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), -0.01 logMAR ± 0.06; monocular distance corrected visual acuity (CDVA), 0.02 logMAR ± 0.06; binocular uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA) at 40 cm, 0.05 logMAR ± 0.08; binocular uncorrected intermediate visual acuity (UIVA) at 80 cm, -0.05 logMAR ± 0.14; postoperative spherical equivalent, 0.26 D ± 0.47; cylinder -0.34 D ± 0.38; FineVision Micro F, binocular UDVA, 0.01 logMAR ± 0.05; monocular CDVA, 0.03 logMAR ± 0.06; binocular UNVA, 0.05 logMAR ± 0.08; binocular UIVA, -0.05 logMAR ± 0.12; spherical equivalent, 0.34 D ± 0.50; cylinder -0.39 D ± 0.40. The IOLs were equivalent in achieving spectacle independence; 98% were ""satisfied"" to ""very satisfied"" with their IOL performance.
3:::Overall, 72 patients were analyzed, with a median follow-up period of 28 months. Malignant melanoma was a predominant etiology. Three kinds of perforator flaps were used, with the thoracodorsal artery perforator flap being the most common. Flaps with skin dimensions matching the defect size were inset and the thickness of the flaps was controlled with primary defatting. Flap re-exploration was conducted in 11 (15.2%) cases and total flap loss occurred in 3 (4.2%) cases. Delayed complications developed in an additional 12 cases, therefore 23 (31.9%) cases required a return to the operating room. The average FFI score was 8.86 at postoperative month 36, on average (range 11-128 months). All respondents reported being independently ambulatory and had minimal difficulty in their daily lives. Reconstruction of defects on weight-bearing regions showed a significantly higher FFI score than that on nonweight-bearing regions (mean 11.96 vs. 4.79, p = 0.029), although the scores remained very low for both instances.
3:::SCNS containing albumin, creatinine, potassium, and body mass index was developed from the first database using low lean tissue index as a marker of protein wasting. When applying this score in the original database, significantly higher risk of developing protein wasting was found for patients with lower SCNS (odds ratio 1.38 [middle tertile vs highest tertile, P < .0001] and 2.40 [lowest tertile vs middle tertile, P < .0001]). The risk of death was also shown to be higher for patients with lower SCNS (hazard ratio 4.45 [below median level vs above median level, P < .0001]). These results were validated in the second database.
3:::The transfer of the method showed that the Orbitrap system provides the same accurate analytical results compared with the LC/MS/MS method except for 4-epitetracycline, anhydroerythromycin A, erythromycin A enol ether, and dihydrostreptomycin. Furthermore, the LC/LTQ-Orbitrap system is capable of successfully competing with the LC/MS/MS method by additional provision of high mass resolution and mass accuracy even though it shows less sensitivity compared with the LC/MS/MS instrument. CCα levels for most analytes were 1.3 times higher by LC/MS/MS than those observed by LC/LTQ-Orbitrap. The method was assessed in terms of relative bias through analysis of a reference material provided by FAPAS (Food Analysis Performance and Assessment Scheme) and also through the control of several contaminated honey samples from local Lebanese markets. Satisfactory relative bias was below 22% except for tetracycline found in one sample that showed a higher bias at 29%.
3:::In the probe test of water maze, the PTZ group had the longest escape latency and least time to pass through the platform. Compared with the PTZ group, the inhibitor group had better performance in escape latency and spatial probe tests. Performance in the water maze test corresponded with the level of p-p38 and caspase 3 in hippocampus. We also found that the down-regulation of p-p38 in the inhibitor group led to down-regulated levels of caspase 3.
3:::In the MCWD group, the mean preoperative air conduction (AC) threshold of 38.2 ± 1.1 dB was lowered to 31.0 ± 0.8 dB postoperatively (p < .01). The mean pre- and postoperative air-bone gaps (ABG) of all patients were 16.0 ± 1.0 dB and 9.6 ± 0.8 dB, respectively. In the canal wall down group, the mean preoperative AC threshold of 37.2 ± 1.0 dB was lowered to 32.8 ± 0.9 dB postoperatively (p < .01). The mean pre- and postoperative air-bone gap was reduced with 4.4 ± 0.4 dB (p < .01). There was statistical difference in hearing improvement between the modified canal wall down and the canal wall down group (p < .05).
3:::In vivo basal skin temperatures beneath TDS at different anatomical sites were not statistically different. The maximum tolerable skin surface temperature was approximately 42-43°C in vivo. The temperature difference between skin surface and TDS surface increased with increasing temperature, or with increasing TDS thermal resistance in vivo and in vitro.
3:::The Dysexecutive/Mixed group demonstrated the fastest rate of decline across all groups. Amnestic and Dysnomic groups showed steeper rates of decline than CDNs. While CDNs had more functional difficulty than NCs across visits, both groups mean FAQ scores remained below its suggested cutoff at all visits.'
3:::Fifteen female patients with a median age of 28 years (interquartile range: 28-44 years) suffering from Crohns disease of the ileum (27%), colon (33%) and ileocolon (40%) were included. VCD manifested most frequently with vulval swelling (93%), pain (80%) and erythema (73%). Histologic analysis demonstrated granulomatous inflammation in 78% and a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate in 67% of cases. In eight (53%) cases, topical therapy resulted in temporary reduction of vulval symptoms. Combotreatment with immunosuppressive agents and tumour necrosis factor α inhibitors was the most effective second-line therapy: five (33%) patients achieved sustained clinical remission with this therapeutic strategy.'
3:::The projected average cumulative cost at 5 years was lower in the two-stent treatment arm ($4,420) compared to the SLT arm ($4,730) or medications-only arm ($6,217). Initial year-zero costs were higher with two iStents ($2,810) than with SLT ($842) or medications only ($996). Average marginal annual costs in years 1-5 were $322 for two iStents, $777 for SLT, and $1,044 for medications only. The cumulative cost differences between two iStents vs SLT or medications only decreased over time, with breakeven by 5 or 3 years post-initiation, respectively. By year 5, cumulative savings with two iStents over SLT or medications only was $309 or $1,797, respectively.
3:::Mitral A velocity increased more rapidly among the patients with RA than the non-RA cohort (age- and sex-adjusted parameter estimate, 0.030; P<0.001). Correspondingly, the mean mitral inflow E/A ratio decreased faster in the RA cohort than the non-RA cohort (adjusted parameter estimate, -0.096; P<0.001). The left atrial volume index increased at a higher rate in the RA cohort than the non-RA cohort (adjusted parameter estimate, 0.150; P<0.001).
3:::Separate analysis of ADL errors associated with the target task versus errors involving the non-target objects revealed that, although the presence of contextually related objects facilitated the accomplishment of the target task, such a condition also led to errors involving the use of irrelevant objects in dementia and MCI.
3:::Diabetes increased MDA formed (47%) and reduced FRAP (20%), TEAC (15%), GSH levels (32%), significantly; decreased GST and GPX activities in the liver and elevated levels of cytokines studied. Treatment of diabetic rats with 500 mg/kg b.wt CA for 14 days decreased MDA (44%); elevated FRAP (15%) and GSH (131%) levels and increased the activities of GST and GPX by 16%. Hepatic concentrations of IL-1β, MCP-1 and TNF-α in DCA group were reduced to 68%, 75% and 63% of DC values, respectively.
3:::High dose of EA (EA-80) increased mature oligodendrocytes population (MOG(+) cells, p < 0.001), and decreased apoptosis (p < 0.05) compared with the cup mice. Treatment with both EA doses did not show any considerable effects on the expression of CXCL12, but significantly down-regulated the expression of IL-17 and up-regulated the expression of IL-11 in mRNA levels compared with the cup mice. Only treatment with EA-80 significantly decreased the population of active macrophage (MAC-3(+) cells, p < 0.001) but not reactive astrocytes (GFAP(+) cells) compared with the cup mice.
3:::Using MS/MS in the multiple reaction monitoring mode, Sofosbuvir and Sofosbuvir d3 were detected without severe interferences from human plasma matrix. Sofosbuvir produced a protonated precursor ion ([M+H](+)) at m/z 428.35 and a corresponding product ion at m/z 279.26. The internal standard produced a protonated precursor ion ([M+H](+)) at m/z 431.38 and a corresponding product ion at m/z 282.37. The calibration curves for the analyte was linear (R(2)≥0.9956, n=4) over the concentration range of 4.063-8000.010ng/mL. Stability studies revealed that Sofosbuvir was stable in plasma during bench top (7h at room temperature), in injector (20h), at the end of five successive freeze and thaw cycles and long term at -70°C±15°C for 15 days.
3:::Our cohort of 19 infants had a median gestational age of 38 weeks (interquartile range 36 to 39) and mean birth weight 2892 ± 920 grams. The most common presenting symptoms of vein of Labbé thrombosis and infarction of surrounding tissue were seizures, apnea, lethargy, and either hypertonia or hypotonia. At the latest clinical follow-up appointment documented in the electronic medical record (mean 4.4 ± 3.08 years), 44% had major neurodevelopmental impairment. Patients with large vein of Labbé infarctions had significantly worse average Bayley scores than those with small to moderate lesions, and differences in language composite were statistically significant (72.7 vs 107.8, P = 0.017).
3:::Anxa2-Tyr23 phosphorylation is necessary for proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Tyr23 phosphorylated Anxa2 binds and enhances the sensitivity of STAT3 activation in response to IL-6, thereby increasing the protein and mRNA expression levels of cyclin D1 and MMP2/9 which are STAT3 key target genes and serve pivotal regulatory functions in cell proliferation and invasion, respectively.
3:::During the study period 149 patients were treated with an iliac branched endograft. Isolated IBD was implanted in 17.8% of the cases; technical success rate was 97.5%. Peri-operative procedure failure occurred in seven patients, four during surgery and three within 30 days of the procedure. Presence of ipsilateral hypogastric aneurysm (p = .031; Exp [B] = 6.72) and intervention performed during the initial study period (p = .006; Exp [B] = 10.40) were predictive of early failure on multivariate analysis. After a mean follow-up of 44.2 months actuarial freedom from IBD related re-intervention was 97.4%, 95.6%, 94.0%, and 91.8% at 1, 3, 5, and 9 years, respectively. Hypogastric artery patency was 94.7%, 92.6%, and 90.4% at 1, 3, and 10 years, respectively. Presence of a hypogastric aneurysm was an independent predictor of target artery occlusion during follow-up on multivariate analysis (p = .007; Exp [B] = 5.93).
3:::The optimal stratification of people with diabetes was specified by four sub-populations. The first sub-population was no complications with an inverse association with the risk of hospitalizations (coefficient-0.247, SE 0.03). Further three sub-populations with DCSI at one (coefficient 0.289, SE 0.01), two (coefficient 0.339, SE 0.01) and three or more (coefficient 0.381, SE 0.01) were used to accurately describe the impact of DCSI on the risk of hospitalization.
3:::Our results showed that nuclear LOX expression is associated with unfavorable outcome in advanced HGSOC, being an independent prognostic factor for disease recurrence. Besides, high nuclear levels were seen to be associated with resistance to first-line chemotherapy. Through gene expression modulation experiments in HGSOC cell lines, we demonstrate that LOX positively regulates cell proliferation, migration and anchorage-independent growth.
3:::Six studies involving 1145 participants were included in this study. Among these studies, two study (N = 513 patients) used placebo as a control and four studies (N = 632 patients) used positive drug controls. The results of meta-analysis suggested that clonidine adhesive patch may be as effective as haloperidol or tiapride for TDs. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in all studies, and the most common AEs of clonidine adhesive patch were rash (8.9%), lightheadedness (8.0%), dry mouth (4.0%). The AEs of clonidine adhesive patch were slight.
3:::Oral administration of Phyllanthus muellarianus aqueous leaf extract significantly (p < 0.05) attenuates acetaminophen-mediated alterations in serum alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin and total bilirubin by 76.56, 85.41, 89.39, 82.77 and 78.38%. Similarly, acetaminophen-mediated decrease in activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase were significantly attenuated in the liver of mice by 85.10, 80.81, 80.45, 76.23 and 95.22%, respectively. Increased levels of conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxides, malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl, fragmented DNA, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and -8 were significantly lowered by Phyllanthus muellarianus aqueous leaf extract.
3:::Median age at diagnosis was 1year (95%CI 0-2.6); median age at treatment was 1.3years (95%CI1.01-2.85). In all pts the PS was confirmed by chest-MRI. Procedural success was 100%. After treatment, pts experiencing previously respiratory symptoms/infections remained asymptomatic at 2.9year follow-up. In pts with significant shunt due to PS, treatment resulted in amelioration in left or right cardiac chamber enlargement at 6 and 12month follow-up. At distance from PS closure (median 14months), chest-MRI confirmed the closure of the aberrant artery and PS regression in 12 patients. In one case, despite the acute procedural success and the supplying artery remained closed, MRI detected residual PS revascularization.
3:::The healing of the defects varied intra-group wise at the first observation period. After 12 weeks the results concerning the cartilage repair score were inhomogeneous within each group, while the macroscopic analysis was more homogenous. In the synovial fluid smear, the mean score of infiltrated synovial and non-synovial cells was slightly increased after 4 weeks and slightly decreased after 12 weeks in both the treatment groups in comparison to the untreated control.
3:::Suvorexant 30 mg (N = 319) was effective compared with placebo (N = 318) on patient-reported and polysomnographic sleep maintenance, and onset endpoints at Night 1 (polysomnographic endpoints)/Week 1 (patient-reported endpoints), Month 1, and Month 3. Suvorexant 15 mg (N = 202 treated) was also effective across these measures, although the onset effect was less evident at later time points. The percentages of patients discontinuing because of adverse events over 3 months were 6.4% for 30 mg (N = 627 treated), 3.5% for 15 mg (N = 202 treated), and 5.5% for placebo (N = 469 treated). Somnolence was the most common adverse event (8.8% for 30 mg, 5.4% for 15 mg, 3.2% for placebo).
3:::The mean spherical equivalent refraction was -3.20±3.51 D and mean AL was 24.39±1.72 mm. Average, minimum, superior, and inferior GC-IPL were 82.59±6.29, 77.17±9.65, 83.68±6.96, and 81.64±6.70 μm, respectively. Average, superior, and inferior peripapillary RNFL were 99.00±11.45, 123.20±25.81, and 124.24±22.23 μm, respectively. Average, superior, and inferior GC-IPL were correlated with AL (β=-2.056, P-value 0.000; β=-2.383, P-value 0.000; β=-1.721, P-value 0.000), but minimum GC-IPL was not (β=-1.056, P-value 0.115). None of the RNFL parameters were correlated with AL.
3:::No significant difference of serum ghrelin levels was found between knee OA patients and healthy controls. Synovial fluid ghrelin concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with K-L grading (r=-0.591, P<0.001).Attenuated synovial fluid ghrelin levels were also related to clinical severity determined by Lequesne index (r=-0.308, P=0.025),VAS scores (r=-0.591, P<0.001) and Lysholm scores (r=0.381, P=0.005).In addition, ghrelin levels were also negatively associated with TNF-α (r=-0.424, P=0.002) and IL-6 concentrations (r=-0.428, P=0.002). ROC curve analysis demonstrated that ghrelin exhibited more diagnostic value than IL-6 and TNF-α for assessing radiographic progression in medium-late stage.
3:::Lung function was significantly improved after 30 and 60days of treatment, but not at later time points. Gains were inversely related to starting lung function. Antibiotic choices did not influence outcomes except for greater clearance with clarithromycin.
3:::Rates of fertilization, blastocyst formation and top and good quality blastocysts were found to be significantly higher in embryos from the LHom group (p < 0.001; p < 0.001; p < 0.001). Small follicles from both homogenous and heterogeneous cycles had significantly lower blastocyst formation and top and good quality blastocyst rates (p < 0.001; p < 0.001). Embryos from SHet had significantly more direct cleavages (p = 0.011). Time to reach blastocyst was shorter in SHom than LHet and LHom (p = 0.002; p = 0.027, respectively). However, once the blastocyst stage was achieved, implantation rates were not significantly different between subgroups, the highest rate being observed in the LHom group. Multivariable analysis revealed that homogeneity of follicular development and follicular size had a significant effect on blastocyst development and quality (p = 0.049; p < 0.001, respectively).
3:::We identified 11-TAAbs (ICAM3, CTAG2, p53, STYXL1, PVR, POMC, NUDT11, TRIM39, UHMK1, KSR1, and NXF3) that distinguished high-grade serous ovarian cancer cases from healthy controls with a combined 45% sensitivity at 98% specificity.
3:::Markedly higher EXT-1 was observed in mature odontoblasts than in pulp at mRNA level with DNA microarray and PCR techniques. Immunohistochemistry of mature tooth revealed EXT-1 both in odontoblasts and the predentin but not in the dentin. EXT-1 was also observed in the odontoblasts of incomplete root, but the localization of the staining was different. In developing foetal tooth, staining was detected in ameloblasts and the basal lamina.
3:::Pearsons correlation coefficient indicated a significant linear correlation between the angle of the groove and the angle of humeral retroversion based on the 70 cadaveric humeral bones (the p-value was 7.5(10-7), the correlation coefficient was -0.5515, and the 95% confidence interval was (-0.6962; -0.3636)). Our study thus demonstrates that the less lateralized the bicipital groove is, the greater the humeral retroversion will be.'
3:::There were statistically significant differences between primary interpretation-second interpretation versus inter-reader overall and major discrepancy rates (28% vs. 6%, P=0.0001; 16% vs. 1%, P=0.0001). There were significant differences in the primary interpretation-second interpretation overall and major discrepancy rates for abusive head trauma patients compared to non-abusive head trauma patients (41% vs 23%, P=0.02; 26% vs. 12%, P=0.03). The most common findings resulting in major radiologic interpretation errors were fractures and subdural hemorrhage. Differences in the age of the patient and the percentage of patients with hemorrhage were statistically significant between the abusive head trauma versus non-abusive head trauma groups, while no statistical difference was identified for skull fractures, ischemia, head CT radiation dose, or presence of multiplanar or 3-D reformatted images. The second interpretation more frequently indicated potential for abusive head trauma compared to the primary interpretation (P=0.0001). MRI and/or surgical findings were in agreement with the second interpretation in 29/29 (100%) of patients with discrepancies.
3:::From 2004 to 2010 there was a non-significant increasing trend in standardized hip fracture incidence in Estonia, but from 2010 to 2015, the trend turned to a significant decrease of 4.5% per year. The consumption of osteoporosis medication increased significantly from 2004 to 2009 by yearly average of 41.2%. After 2009, the consumption levelled. On contrast, the average price of one daily dose of osteoporosis medication decreased significantly from 2004 to 2009 by 16.9% per year and the decrease also levelled after 2009. This gives a very strong negative correlation of -0.93 (p < 0.001) between the consumption of antiosteoporotic medication and the average price of a daily dose of medication during the study period.
3:::We observed inverse associations between blood benzene concentrations and hemoglobin concentration and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and a positive association with red cell distribution width among tobacco smoke-unexposed participants (n=146). Among tobacco smoke-exposed participants (n=247), we observed positive associations between blood VOC concentrations and several hematologic parameters, including increased white blood cell and platelet counts, suggestive of hematopoietic stimulation typically associated with tobacco smoke exposure. Most associations were stronger for benzene than for the other VOCs.
3:::Overall, 20 (44.4%) patients required insulin to achieve target blood glucose. Insulin-treated patients had higher glycated hemoglobin A1c, more premorbid insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes, and greater blood glucose levels but lower c-peptide levels on admission. Premorbid insulin-requiring diabetes was independently associated with lower admission c-peptide, whereas greater plasma creatinine was independently associated with higher levels. Increases in c-peptide were positively correlated with an increase in blood glucose both in patients who did (r = 0.54, P = 0.01) and did not (r = 0.56, P = 0.004) receive insulin. However, insulin administration was independently associated with a greater increase in c-peptide (P = 0.04). This association was not modified by the use of oral insulin secretagogues.
3:::Thirty eight percent of women had p,p´-DDE levels below the Limit of Detection and 12.3% below the Limit of Quantification. Within the quantifiable range, median was 53.03ng/g. TSH >2.5 mIU/L was present in 9.3% of women; 47.7% had isolated hypothyroxinemia; 3.5% had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 5.8% had overt hypothyroidism. We observed a significant positive association between quantifiable p,p´-DDE and total T3 serum levels in comparison with those with concentrations below the Limit of Detection (β=0.19; 95% CI=0.06, 0.34). There were no significant associations with other hormones of the thyroid profile or with clinical diagnosis.
3:::Higher educational levels, better working memory and executive functioning of parents were associated with better attribution of their offsprings symptoms to schizophrenia.'
3:::In the efficacy analysis, the overall odds ratio (OR) for sputum culture conversion was 1.895 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.355-2.651, p=0.000), indicating that when moxifloxacin is combined with the recommended regimen, the rate of sputum culture conversion is elevated compared to the recommended regimen alone. The overall OR for recurrence was 0.516 (95% CI 0.342-0.920, p=0.022), suggesting that the introduction of moxifloxacin into the recommended regimen reduces TB relapse after treatment. In the safety analysis, the overall OR was estimated to be 1.001 (95% CI 0.855-1.172, p=0.989), demonstrating that adding moxifloxacin to the recommended regimen does not cause more adverse events during TB treatment.
3:::Women expressed specific preferences for the method of pain relief. Some confronted systemic barriers in exploring their options for pain relief, while others were given a choice. At times, anesthesiologists lacked knowledge and experience in caring for women with disabilities. Conversely, some women described how the administration of anesthesia was meticulously planned and attributed their positive labor and delivery experiences to this careful planning.
3:::Cyclothymic temperamental quantity differentiated - both at the univariate and multivariate levels - between patients who had various different types of Substance Use Disorder, largely irrespective of the principal substance of abuse (heroin or alcohol); irritable temperament quantity differentiated HUD patients from AUD patients. Hyperthymic temperament typology seemed to be more frequent in healthy controls at both univariate and multivariate levels.
3:::The mean annual dose of RLAI was 638.41mg, which was equal to an average dose of 24.6mg every 2 weeks. The prevalence of concomitant use of conventional antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics, lithium, and antidepressants decreased from the pre-RLAI period to the post-RLAI period by 23.75%, 31.91%, 1.29%, and 7.08%, respectively. RLAI use decreased emergency room (ER) visits, hospital admissions, length of hospital stay, and non-medication costs (all P<0.0001). The cost savings with RLAI were attributed to lower hospitalization costs in spite of higher medication costs. Moreover, rapid cycling patients (n=36) demonstrated greater reduction in ER and inpatient services with RLAI than non-rapid cycling patients (n=251).
3:::The results of a multiple linear regression model showed that perceived confrontation efficacy significantly predicted athletes anti-doping attitudes. Specifically, the factor of efficacy with respect to intimacy was the sole significant predictor.'
3:::Twelve randomized trials with data for the primary outcome were identified. Data were available for meta-analysis for two comparisons. Wounds managed with film dressings (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.57) or with hydrofiber dressings (odds ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20-0.40) were significantly less likely to have wound complications than those managed with passive dressings. There was no evidence that any dressing significantly reduced surgical-site infection rates compared with any other dressing. Hydrofibre dressings showed better fluid handling capacity than passive dressings in terms of mean number of dressing changes (mean difference 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-2.57) and number of patients requiring early dressing change (odds ratio, 8.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.68-15.83).
3:::Analyses revealed that the 2 types of therapist adaptations (Augmenting and Reducing/Reordering) could be readily discriminated, with therapists reporting significantly more Augmenting than Reducing/Reordering adaptations. Therapists of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity and with fewer years of experience reported more extensive Augmenting adaptations, but no therapist background characteristics were associated with Reducing/Reordering adaptations. Therapists general attitudes that EBPs diverged from their personal approach to therapy were associated with reporting more Augmenting and Reducing/Reordering adaptations. In contrast, negative perceptions toward the specific EBP predicted Reducing/Reordering adaptations, but not Augmenting adaptations.'
3:::Total 107 of 126 cases of NSCLCs were included for analysis, where both cytology and biopsy material were adequate for interpretation. FNAC allowed tumor typing in 83 (77.6%) cases; 36 (33.6%) were ADC, 47 (43.9%) cases were SQCC and 24 (22.4%) cases diagnosed as Non-small cell carcinoma not otherwise specified (NSCLC-NOS). In biopsy, 86 cases (80.4%) were typed, among which 34 (31.8%) were ADC, 52 (48.6%) were SQCC and 21 (19.6%) were of NSCLC-NOS type. The result of Chi-square index was significant. With the aid of IHC, NSCLC-NOS reduced from 14 (13%) cases to 2 (1.9%) cases.
3:::For the eight drugs included, 380 citations were identified. The primary outcome results were reported in 32 clinical trials with explicit and relevant data on older people. Though over 24,000 patients aged >75/80 years were studied for warfarin, data on geriatric syndromes were rare (two studies reporting on frailty/falls/mental status) and missing for all other compounds. Apixaban was rated FORTA-A (highly beneficial). Other non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (including low/high-intensity dabigatran and high-intensity edoxaban) and warfarin were assigned to FORTA-B (beneficial). Phenprocoumon, acenocoumarol and fluindione were rated FORTA-C (questionable), mainly reflecting the absence of data.
3:::The efficacy of these polymeric test patterns for the advancement of chemical imaging techniques was illustrated by their use to judge the spatial resolution improvement achieved by heating the ionization interface of the current instrument platform. The spatial resolution of the mass spectral chemical images was estimated to be 1.4 μm, based on the ability to statistically distinguish 0.7-μm-wide lines separated by 0.7-μm-wide spacings in those images when the interface cross was heated to 200°C.
3:::Seventy-four drowned patients were included, of which 36 (49%) were diagnosed by the clinician as having early pneumonia. Concerning the overall population, the median simplified acute physiology score (version 2) was 45 (30-65), and the mortality was 26%. Twenty-four respiratory samples from different patients were obtained within the first 48 h. Sixteen were positive. The main microorganisms found were Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Streptococcus pneumonia and Staphylococcus aureus) with a low rate of antimicrobial resistance. No MDR bacteria or fungi were identified. However, among the positive respiratory samples collected, 5/16 (31%) grew bacteria with natural resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate, the first-line antibiotic commonly used in our cohort. Resistance was only found among Gram-negative bacteria and from respiratory samples of patients with a higher drowning grade at admission (p = 0.01).
3:::There were 965 respondents from 52 countries. Surgeon-performed ultrasound is practiced by more than one third of respondents. Otolaryngologists perform preoperative and postoperative vocal cord evaluation more often than endocrine/general surgeons (p < .001). Sixty percent of respondents either never place drains or place drains <50% of the time in thyroid lobectomies (43% for total thyroidectomies). Outpatient thyroid surgery is most frequently performed by surgeons in the United States (63%).
3:::In anesthetized healthy animals, nalbuphine led to a significant reduction of respiratory rate, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure during short-term experiments. In awake septic animals, a continuous nalbuphine infusion did not affect heart rate but significantly improved the values of the Rat Grimace Scale. Nalbuphine plasma concentrations remained stable between 4 and 24 h of continuous infusion in septic rats.
3:::This study included 80 lobectomies. All patients showed no evidence of postoperative RLN palsy, bleeding, or hypoparathyroidism. The superior parathyroid gland was consistently found within the false capsule in all cases, whereas the inferior parathyroid was found within the same layer in 64 sides (80%).
3:::There was no significant main effect of aripiprazole or interaction with BIS-11 score during the natural drinking period. However, there was a main effect of aripiprazole on bar laboratory drinking (p = 0.04) and aripiprazole reduced the total number of drinks consumed more among individuals with low self-control (p = 0.034) and increased latency to consume those drinks (p = 0.045) more among those with high impulsivity. Relative to placebo, aripiprazole caused more side effects and increased alcohol-induced sedation, but neither significantly influenced its interaction with impulsivity/self-control scores on drinking.
3:::Multiple SNPs in SLCO1B1, a gene encoding a hepatic influx transporter, displayed genome-wide significant associations with E1C plasma concentrations and with the E1C/E1 ratio. The top SNP for E1C concentrations, rs4149056 (p = 3.74E-11), was a missense variant that results in reduced transporter activity. Patients homozygous for the variant allele had significantly higher average E1C plasma concentrations than did other patients. Furthermore, three other SLCO1B1 SNPs, not in LD with rs4149056, were associated with both E1C concentrations and the E1C/E1 ratio and were cis-eQTLs for SLCO1B3. GWAS signals of suggestive significance were also observed for E1, androstenedione, and the E1/androstenedione ratio.
3:::In total, 426 patients were included and treated with a SOF-based regimen (n=233, 54.7%) or TVR/BOC-based regimen (n=193, 45.3%). Among patients treated with a TVR/BOC-based regimen 34 (18%) of 193 patients experienced AKI compared to 26 (11%) of 233 patients treated with SOF-based regimens (P=.056). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of ascites (OR: 4.44, 95%CI: 1.46-13.54, P=.009) and the use of NSAIDs (OR: 4.47, 95%CI: 1.32-15.19, P=.016) were associated with a risk of AKI during SOF-based antiviral therapy. Creatinine levels returned to normal at end of follow-up in 23 (88%) of the 26 patients who experienced AKI with a SOF-based regimen and had a creatinine level available during follow-up.
3:::Overall, 352 patients [211 (60%) with ITCs and 141 (40%) with micrometastases] were identified. 162 (46%) patients had SLNB alone and one node was positive in 295 (84%) cases; 31 (9%) patients had PMRT and 95% had systemic therapy. At a median 6 years of follow-up, the overall crude LRR rate was 2.8% (n = 9), with no axillary recurrences, and the crude LRR rate was 3.9% among those who had SNB alone. Those with LRR had a median age of 55 years, median tumor size of 1.7 cm, and ductal histology; the majority were high-grade (89%) and estrogen receptor positive (78%), with one positive node (89%). There was no association between LRR and receipt of PMRT (p = 0.4), SLNB versus ALND (p = 0.2), or number of positive nodes (p = 0.7) using the log-rank test.
3:::Fifteen papers were included: 13 intervention studies and two cross-sectional surveys. A variety of psychological, dietary and pharmacological interventions were reported. Four of six studies reported pain reduction with psychological intervention including individualised and group-based relaxation, disease anxiety-related Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and stress management. Both psychologist-led and self-directed stress management in inactive Crohns disease reduced pain compared with controls (symptom frequency reduction index=-26.7, -11.3 and 17.2 at 6-month follow-up, respectively). Two dietary interventions (alcoholic drinks with high sugar content and fermentable carbohydrate with prebiotic properties) had an effect on abdominal pain. Antibiotics (for patients with bacterial overgrowth) and transdermal nicotine patches reduced abdominal pain. Current and past cannabis users report it relieves pain. One controlled trial of cannabis reduced SF-36 and EQ-5D pain scores (1.84 and 0.7, respectively). These results must be treated with caution: data were derived from predominantly small uncontrolled studies of moderate to low quality.'
3:::There were 591 (27.7%) non-drinkers, 1466 (68.7%) social drinkers, and 77 (3.6%) daily drinkers (total n = 2134). In the first cycle, compared to non-drinkers, daily drinkers had a twofold increased risk of spontaneous abortion (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-4.5) among all cycle starts, and while their risk of live birth was 30% lower (aRR 0.7; 95% CI 0.4-1.3), the sample size was small, and it was not significantly lower. By the end of 6 cycles, social drinkers and daily drinkers did not differ from non-drinkers in their cumulative incidence of live birth (56.1, 50.6, and 52.1%, respectively; both P ≥ 0.28).
3:::Utilizing Structural Equation Models (SEM) it was found that risky driving behaviors in BRT operators could be predicted through job strain, effort-reward imbalance and social support at work. It was also found that fatigue and need for recovery fully mediate the associations between job strain and risky driving, and between social support and risky driving, but not the association between effort/reward imbalance (ERI) and risky driving.
3:::From 2008 to 2015, 126 patients were treated by CT-guided RFA for OO in our institution. Mean patient age was 26.1 years (SD = 11, range 1-53); mean delay to diagnosis was 16.9 months (SD = 15.2, range 1-120). Among patients who answered the follow-up call (n = 88), the overall success rate was 94.3%: 79/88 (89.8%) had primary success of the procedure, and 4/88 (4.5%) had a secondary success (repeat-RFA after pain recurrence). Mean follow-up time was 34.6 months (SD = 24.7, range 3-90). Few complications occurred: two mild reversible peripheral nerve injuries, one brachial plexus neuropathy, one broken electrode tip fragment, and one muscular hematoma.
3:::Adolescents with neck pain showed higher levels of catastrophizing (p < 0.001) and anxiety (trait: p < 0.001; state: p = 0.028), lower PPTs (p < 0.001) and higher JRE (p < 0.001) than asymptomatic controls. Pain intensity, frequency and duration were moderately correlated with anxiety, and disability was moderately correlated with anxiety (r between 0.43 and 0.50, p < 0.05) and catastrophizing (r = 0.40, p < 0.05).
3:::During screening, 551 patients provided matched tumor tissue and plasma samples. Pooled analysis of the positive and negative percent agreements between the cobas plasma and tissue tests for detection of T790M mutation were 61% and 79%, respectively. Comparing cobas plasma test with next-generation sequencing demonstrated positive and negative percent agreements of 90% or higher. The objective response rate was 64% (95% confidence interval: 57-70) in T790M mutation-positive patients by both cobas tissue and plasma tests (evaluable for response).
3:::A total of 93 226 surgical procedures for POP were performed. The age-adjusted incidence of prolapse surgery was 1.3/1000 women in 1987. After that there was an increase which peaked in 1996 with 1.9/1000, and a decline thereafter back to 1.3/1000 in 2009. The lifetime risk for a woman to have undergone at least one surgical procedure for prolapse was 12.8%. Surgery was most common within women aged 70 to 79 years, followed by women aged 60 to 69 years. The most popular procedure until 1991 was cervix amputation with colporraphies, surpassed thereafter by colporraphies only or with combined vaginal hysterectomy.
3:::The investigated groups presented distinct metabolic profiles, in which the main differential metabolites found in the serum sample of bipolar disorder patients compared with those from controls were lipids, lipid metabolism-related molecules (choline, myo-inositol), and some amino acids (N-acetyl-L-phenyl alanine, N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamic acid, L-glutamine). In addition, amygdalin, α-ketoglutaric acid, and lipoamide, among other compounds, were also present or were significantly altered in the serum of bipolar disorder patients. The data presented herein suggest that some of these metabolites differentially distributed between the groups studied may be directly related to the bipolar disorder pathophysiology.
3:::The secondhand smoker group had significantly lower baby weight (2.94±0.31kg vs 3.05±0.40kg), head circumference (30.87±2.35cm vs 37.13±2.36cm), length (46.58±1.95cm vs 51.53±2.05cm) and placental weight (520±73.5g vs 596±61.3g) and significantly higher cord blood cotinine levels (16.35±12.84ng/mL vs 0.56±0.22ng/mL). Cord blood cotinine levels had significant negative correlations with placental weight (r=-0.461), babys weight (r=-0.297), baby's head circumference (r=-0.501) and baby's length (r=-0.374).'
3:::Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Vaginal wind occurs on random movements and during or after coitus. The prevalence ranges from one to 69%. The pathophysiology is unclear and the incidence unknown. Known risk factors are vaginal delivery and urinary incontinence. Provoking factors are coitus, digital stimulation, cunnilingus and exercising. Female sexual function is decreased. The sexual function of male partners with vaginal wind is not influenced. Overall vaginal wind leads to a decrease in the quality of live and can have cause social isolation. The treatment is related to the cause and mainly not successful. Tampons can be used for treatment as well as prevention.
3:::Seventy-eight lymph nodes met inclusion criteria. Two of the 78 sampled nodes (2.6%) were malignant.
3:::Throughout the enrollment period, 219 endoscopists (74.5%) increased their annual ADR category. During 895,916 person-years of follow-up evaluation through the National Cancer Registry, we identified 168 interval colorectal cancers and 44 interval cancer deaths. An increased ADR was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio for interval colorectal cancer of 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45-0.88; P = .006), and for cancer death of 0.50 (95% CI, 0.27-0.95; P = .035). Compared with no increase in ADR, reaching or maintaining the highest quintile ADR category (such as an ADR > 24.56%) decreased the adjusted hazard ratios for interval colorectal cancer to 0.27 (95% CI, 0.12-0.63; P = .003), and 0.18 (95% CI, 0.06-0.56; P = .003), respectively.
3:::Participants had differing views as to what constituted a hub' in their projects. Two themes emerged around the spaces that shape the learning experience of student and newly qualified health visitors. Firstly, a generalised need for a 'quiet place' which allows pause for reflection but also for sharing experiences and relieving common anxieties. Secondly, the role of physical arrangements in open-plan spaces to promote access to support from more experienced practitioners.'
3:::A consensus regarding inclusion and response categories was achieved for nearly all metrics. A recommendation was made of 53 metrics which would be appropriate in a minimum data set.
3:::Twenty-five and 20 compounds were identified from leaf and branch oils, respectively (98.85 and 99.13%). The major ones were: eucalyptol (59.44%; 55.74%), sabinene (14.99%; 7.12%), α-terpineol (6.44%; 9.81%), α-pinene (5.27%; 4.71%). Following 4 h of treatment leaves volatile oil at doses of 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg significantly reduced paw volume to 94, 82 and 69%, respectively. The same doses significantly reduced COX-2 activity to 73.8, 50.7 and 21.4 nmol/min/mL, respectively. A significant reduction of PGE2 concentration was observed (2.95 ± 0.2, 2.45 ± 0.15 and 1.75 ± 0.015 pg/mL). CG oil exhibited a significant modulatory effect on ethanol-induced gastritis in rats as the level of NO reduced to 32, 37 and 41 μM nitrate/g and also a significant inhibition of lipid peroxidation was observed via reduction of MDA concentration (1.15, 1.11 and 1.04 nmol/g).
3:::Women positive for C. trachomatis had significantly lower cervicovaginal hBD-1, hBD-2, and hBD-3 compared with those who tested negative (hBD-1: 0 pg/mL [0-2.1] vs 1.6 pg/mL [0-2.4], p < .0001; hBD-2: 0 pg/mL [0-3.9] vs 0.61 pg/mL [0-8.9], p = .0097; and hBD-3: 0 pg/mL [0-4.3] vs 0.28 pg/mL [0-8.4], p = .0076). Human β-defensin 4 was not detected.
3:::A total of 62 patients were included in the study. TF was detected in 21 patients by radiography and in 24 patients by POCUS. FF was detected in 24 patients by radiography and in 25 patients by POCUS. Ten of the patients had both TF and FF. Compared with radiography, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of POCUS in the detection of TF were 100%, 93%, 88% and 100% (95% CI, 91-100%), respectively. Compared with direct X-ray imaging, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of POCUS in the detection of FF were 100%, 97%, 96% and 100% (95% CI, 96-100%), respectively. We determined that POCUS is also successful in detection of fracture features such as angulation, step-off, extension into the joint space that can determine the treatment decision.
3:::There were statistically significant improvements in self-reported knowledge and perceived skills-based competence from pre-training to post-training for all content domains of the curriculum: older adults and abuse (p<0.0001), documentation, legislative, and legal issues (p<0.0001); interview with the older adult, caregiver, and other relevant contacts (p<0.0001); assessment (p=0.0018); medical and forensic examination (p<0.0001); case summary, discharge plan, and follow-up care (p<0.0001). The post-training evaluation survey demonstrated satisfaction among participants across all components of the curriculum and its delivery, particularly with reference to the comprehensiveness of the curriculum, and the clarity and appropriateness of the training materials.
3:::Using magnetic nanoparticles, the TRFIA immunoassay exhibited broad dynamic assay ranges for PG I with detection limit of 0.33 ng/mL, while for PG II with detection limit of 0.38 ng/mL. Cross-reactivity between PGs I and II were <15. The intra- and inter-assay coefficient variations of the method were <3%, and the recoveries were in the range of 97-103% for serum samples. Bland-Altman analysis of 124 serum samples showed good consistency with a commercial TRFIA kit. For PG I, the mean (95% confidence interval) difference was 0.97 (-14.3-12.3) ng/mL, whilst for PG II the difference was 0.6 (-4.4-3.2) ng/mL.
3:::Mean age of donor and recipient was 33.7 and 33.9 years, respectively. 59.6% died due to trauma. Mean of years on dialysis was 3.7. 22.9% of patients had delayed graft function (DGF). Calculated 5-year probability of graft survival during transplantation time was 74.1%; 7 days after transplantation, 74.9%; and one year after transplantation, 76.4%. 5-year death censored graft survival was 64.9%. There were no differences between death-censored graft survival and calculated probabilities (Z-test), with a C-statistic value of 0.54 ± 0.6 (95%CI 0.42-0.65, p = 0.5) and 0.51 ± 0.6 (0.39-0.63, 95% CI, p = 0. 7) for transplant time and seven days after. C-statistic value 1-year after transplantation was 0.68 ± 0.8 (95%CI 0.52-0.84, p = 0.02).
3:::The probability that the female patient did not experience PPAE with the initial treatment was 87.91% with dienogest, 80.07% with danazol, 84.93% with medroxyprogesterone (injectable and oral) and 89.17% with gosereline. The probability that the female patient abandoned her initial treatment was 9% with dienogest, 12.07% with danazol, 9.6 and 6.75% with medroxyprogesterone injectable and oral, respectively, and 10.8 and 3.6% 3-monthly and monthly with gosereline.
3:::15 females and 13 males were included, 20 with GPW and 8 with CCS. The mean age was 50.1 ± 12.7 years, and the evolution time was 69 ± 49.6 months. We didnt find cases of MAP. 23 patients (82.1%) had general symptoms. The initial and final BVAS means were 10.5 and 1.5 (p < 0.001) and the global VDI was 2.4.'
3:::Within each group, significant improvements were found for clinical parameters, though without significant differences between groups. RANK-L was significantly decreased at week 13 in the SRP+PDT group compared with the SRP group. SRP+PDT, but not SRP alone, significantly reduced the abundance of A. actinomycetemcomitans.
3:::The risk factors associated with a preterm labor were placenta praevia: OR = 10.2 (p = 0.005); previous preterm delivery: OR = 10.2 (p = 0.005); preeclampsia: OR = 6.38 (p = 0.00); twin pregnancy: OR = 5.8 (p = 0.000); oligohydramnios: OR = 5.8 (p = 0.000); tobacco use: OR = 4.6 (p = 0.002); premature rupture of membranes (PROM): OR = 4.1 (p = 0.000); cervicovaginitis: OR = 3 (p = 0.000); urinary tract infections (UTI): OR = 1.5 (p = 0.010).
3:::The average age of PPwH was 10.66 years (SD = 2.61) and that of parents was 36.28 years (SD = 6.4). 82% suffered from hemophilia A and 70% suffered from severe hemophilia. 78% of participants felt at risk or at high risk with regards to their quality of life, and, concerning their depression levels, we found moderate symptoms in 54% and severe symptoms in 10%.
3:::Percentages of Tc-SC uptake ranged from 19.3 to 77.3% for the liver; 3.4 to 40.7% for the spleen; and 19.0 to 56.7% for the bone marrow. Spearmans correlation coefficient showed a significant statistical association between Child-Pugh score and bone marrow uptake at 0.55 (P≤0.05), liver uptake at 0.71 (P≤0.001), spleen uptake at 0.56 (P≤0.05), and spleen plus bone marrow uptake at 0.71 (P≤0.001). There was also a good correlation of SC uptake percentages with individual quantitative liver function components such as albumin and total bilirubin, and qualitative liver function components (varices, portal hypertension, ascites). For albumin: r=0.64 (P<0.001) compared with liver uptake percentage from the whole-body counts, r=0.49 (P<0.001) compared with splenic uptake percentage, and r=0.45 (P≤0.05) compared with bone marrow uptake percentage.'
3:::The preparation techniques did not affect the percentage of accumulated hard-tissue debris (P = 0.126). The percentage of untouched canal areas was significantly higher for BioRace (32.38%), and Reciproc (18.95%) with the SAF (16.08%) system having the least untouched area results (P < 0.05). The Reciproc system removed significantly more dentine (4.18%) compared to the BioRace (2.21%) and SAF (2.56%) systems (P < 0.05). The TRUShape system had intermediate results for both untouched canal areas (19.20%) and dentine removed (3.77%), with no significant difference compared to BioRace, Reciproc and SAF systems.
3:::The major ingredients including alkaloids, flavonoids, amino acids, saccarides, ginsenosides, lignans and terpenoids were readily detected. Compared with electrospray ionization (ESI), EAPPI allowed the ionization of a wider range of compounds, which is desirable for the integral characterization of TCHMs containing numerous constituents. The significant discrepancies for both alkaloids and terpenoids in tripterygium glycosides tablets from two different manufacturers could be simultaneously reflected from EAPPI mass spectra.
3:::Of the 93 patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer, 35 patients (37.6%) were subsequently classified as having resectable disease following CRT. The median overall survival of patients who received CRT alone for locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer was 8.0 months, and all died within 3 years. On the other hand, the overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates in patients who were reclassified as having resectable tumour after CRT were 71.3%, 39.2% and 23.5%, respectively. Our pathological assessments after surgical resection suggested that CRT might be associated with a significant reduction in the risk of lymph node metastases in patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer.
3:::Among 523,808 reports of adverse drug reactions we identified 454 reports of gingival bleeding (0.09%). Most of them were ""serious"" (58.4%) and occurred in females (54.6%). The frequency of gingival bleeding increased with age. The most frequently ""suspected"" drugs were antithrombotics (67.8%), particularly fluindione. Other drugs frequently involved were furosemide followed by paracetamol, amiodarone, amoxicillin, paroxetine, ketoprofen, zolpidem, enalapril and ramipril. Thirty nine reports involved a drug-drug interaction with antithrombotics, mainly with antiinfectives.
3:::Psychostimulants were associated with statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms in major depressive disorder (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.78; P = 0.003) and bipolar disorder (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.13-1.78; P = 0.003). Efficacy outcomes differed across the psychostimulants evaluated as a function of response rates: ar/modafinil (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.20-1.81; P = 0.0002); dextroamphetamine (OR, 7.11; 95% CI, 1.09-46.44; P = 0.04); lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.94-1.56; P = ns); methylphenidate (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.88-2.54; P = ns). Efficacy outcomes also differed between agents used as adjunctive therapy (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.19-1.64) or monotherapy (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 0.67-7.52).
3:::Analogous to their promotion of low-grade inflammation, compositionally defined diet of high- and low-fat content with cellulose increased the severity of DSS-induced colitis relative to chow. However, in contrast to the case of low-grade inflammation, addition of inulin, but not the insoluble fiber cellulose, further exacerbated the severity of colitis and its associated clinical manifestations (weight loss and bleeding) in both low- and high-fat diets.
3:::Autophagic flux was significantly (p<0.05) inhibited by MTA extracts, causing Notch degradation arrest. This resulted in the promotion of cell proliferation and inhibition of differentiation during the logarithmic phase of cell growth.
3:::Of the 450 consecutive patients, 441 were studied. There were no differences in insertion times or number of insertion attempts among the groups. There was no difference in pharyngolaryngeal complications among the groups: G1, 57%; G2, 55%; G3, 52%, (P = 0.77). Blood on the airway was observed less frequently in G3 (9%) compared with G1 and G2 combined (17%): difference -8% (95% confidence interval of the difference -0.8 to -16%, P = 0.01).
3:::Seventy-five consecutive patients were admitted (50 sepsis and 25 trauma). There was no difference in SOFA and SAPSII scores between the two groups. Patients with sepsis had lower total cholesterol levels than patients with trauma. Regarding the lipoprotein profile, only HDLs differed significantly between the two groups (median [IQR] = 0.33 mmol/l [0.17-0.78] in sepsis patients versus median [IQR] = 0.99 mmol/l [0.74-1.28] in trauma patients; P < 0.0001). Whereas ICU mortality was not associated with lipid levels in the sepsis group, a significant negative correlation was found between HDL concentration and the length of ICU stay (r = -0.35; P = 0.03) in the group of survivor septic patients at ICU discharge. In addition, poor outcome defined as death or a SOFA score >6 at day 3 was associated with lower HDL levels (median [IQR] = 0.20 mmol/l [0.11-0.41] vs. 0.35 mmol/l [0.19-0.86] in patients with poor outcome versus others; P = 0.03).
3:::In 6 years, 361 lesions from 356 patients were treated (3 fractions: 297; 5 fractions: 64). The median follow-up was 16 months. 23 patients (6.5%) developed CW toxicity after a median time of 10 months following treatment. The mean CW V30/V37 was 21 cm(3) for patients with CW toxicity and 17 cm(3) for patients without toxicity (p < 0.05). The 2-year local control and the CW toxicity rates were similar, whether patients received three or five fractions (97% vs 96% and 7% vs 5%).
3:::No differences between the baseline group and the exposed group (RFR) were observed. NMDA-NR1 expression decreased after CFA injection and RFR exposure, and an elevated expression of NMDA-NR1 was observed in healthy control rats of both groups: TRAM/RFR and RFR.
3:::Case records of 140 cats were reviewed; fixator-associated complications (FACs) occurred in 19% of cats. The region of ESF placement was significantly associated with complication development. Complications developed most frequently in the femur (50%), tarsus (35%) and radius/ulna (33%). Superficial pin tract infection (SPTI) and implant failure accounted for 45% and 41% of all FACs, respectively. SPTI occurred more frequently in the femur, humerus and tibia, with implant failure more frequent in the tarsus. No association between breed, age, sex, weight, fracture type (open vs closed), ESF classification, number of pins per bone segment, degree of fracture load sharing, and the incidence or type of FAC was identified. No association between region of placement, breed, age, sex, weight, fracture type (open vs closed), ESF classification, number of pins per bone segment, fracture load sharing and the time to complication development was identified.
3:::The LN was identified in 10.4% of 1332 cholecystectomies. The American Society of Anesthesiologists class 3 was associated with a lower rate of LN excision compared with class 1 (odds ratio: 0.36; P = 0.049) as was the presence of a senior surgical trainee (odds ratio: 0.18; P < 0.001). Rate of LN excision was independent of patient demographic and clinical characteristics, including indication for cholecystectomy, conversion to open, gallbladder perforation, cholangiography, bile duct exploration and overall surgical difficulty.
3:::An increase in the number of physicians at both county hospitals and PHCs was associated with increased outpatient visits by DM patients, particularly more physicians at PHCs. With increased numbers of physicians at PHCs, outpatient visits among residents with DM in rural and western areas of China increased more than those in urban and eastern areas. More physicians at PHCs had a positive impact on improving the likelihood of outpatient visits at PHCs. The positive influence of increasing the number of physicians available to DM patients in rural and western areas was greater than that for urban and eastern DM patients.
3:::Fourteen out of 25 patients presented with singular cardiac mass (56%), whereas ten patients (40%) presented with multifocal and one patient with disseminated cardiac metastases. Twelve patients presented with endocardial (48%), eight with myocardial and two with pericardial metastases. Most frequent site involved in endocardial metastases was the right atrium (67%) followed by the right ventricle (33%). There seems to be a correlation between histological subtype and location of cardiac metastasis. Median survival after diagnosis of cardiac metastases was 8 months, with no significant difference regarding the localization of metastases within the heart.
3:::Of the 11,068 patients with rectal cancer, 56.2% had surgical resection alone, 21.7% received preoperative radiation, and 22.1% received postoperative radiation. The median follow-up for all of the groups of patients was >2 years. All of the groups of patients with rectal cancer were more likely to develop a urinary adverse event compared with control subjects. Adjusted HRs were 2.28 (95% CI, 2.02-2.57) for abdominoperineal resection alone, 2.24 (95% CI, 1.79-2.80) for preoperative radiation and surgical resection, 2.04 (95% CI, 1.70-2.44) for surgical resection and postoperative radiation, and 1.69 (95% CI, 1.52-1.89) for low anterior resection alone.
3:::Before propensity score matching, the single-site laparoscopic colectomy group had greater proportions of women and of patients with right-sided and early stage tumors compared with the conventional multiport laparoscopic colectomy group. After matching, the 2 groups each included 200 patients and did not significantly differ in any patient characteristics. The median follow-up period was 41.4 months. The 2 groups showed similar rates of intraoperative morbidity (p = 0.22) and postoperative complications (p = 0.87). Rates of 3-year disease-free and overall survival in single-site laparoscopic colectomy and conventional, multiport, laparoscopic colectomy groups were 95.5% and 91.3% (p = 0.44) and 100.0% and 98.7% (p = 0.24). The 3-year disease-free and overall survival rates in each stage did not significantly differ between the 2 groups.
3:::Forty-three CSP cases after unsuccessful curettage treatment were successfully treated by operative hysteroscopy. The estimated intraoperative blood loss was 20.00 (10.00-500.00) mL, the hysteroscopic operating time was 20.00 (15.00-45.00) min, the decline of serum β-hCG the day after surgery was 71.91 ± 14.05%, the total hospitalisation time was 7.87 ± 2.26 days, the medical cost was 13,682.71 ± 3553.77 China Yuan (CNY), the time of bleeding after surgery was 7.42 ± 2.48 days, and the time of serum β-hCG resolution after surgery was 13.84 ± 9.83 days. Follow-up after discharge demonstrated that there were no severe complications for any patients.
3:::An iris biopsy showed an infiltrate of plasma cells. Immunohistochemistry for kappa and lambda light chains demonstrated lambda light chain restriction. Systemic hematologic investigations including complete blood count, serum paraproteins, bone marrow biopsy, and full-body magnetic resonance image were normal. The monoclonal plasma cell infiltrate was consistent with a solitary iris plasmacytoma. The mass was treated with ruthenium plaque radiotherapy. After 4 years of follow-up, the mass remained regressed, and no systemic myeloma has developed.
3:::Average age of the 106 patients (64 women and 42 men) was 68 ± 11 years. Postoperative best spectacle-corrected visual acuity was 0.19 ± 0.13 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution in the FE-DMEK group and 0.35 ± 0.48 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution in the M-DMEK group (P = 0.218). One day after surgery, there were no significant graft detachments in the FE-DMEK group, compared with 20% graft detachment rate in the M-DMEK group (P = 0.041). Rebubbling was performed in 17% of eyes in the M-DMEK group compared with none in the FE-DMEK group (P = 0.066). The mean endothelial cell count in the FE-DMEK and M-DMEK groups at 6 months after surgery were 2105 ± 285 cells per square millimeter (24% cells loss) and 1990 ± 600 cells per square millimeter (29% cells loss), respectively (P = 0.579).
3:::In 141 parasites, eight nucleotide changes (two changes were synonymous and other six were nonsynonymous) were detected in 1536 bp. The PvMDR1 amino acid changes Y976F, F1076FL were predominant in endemic parasites from NIC-NE and outbreak parasites in NIC-NW but absent in SMX. Thirteen haplotypes were resolved, and found to be closely related, but their frequency at each geographic site was different (P = 0.0001). The pvmdr1 codons 925-1083 gene fragment showed higher genetic and haplotype diversity in parasites from NIC-NE than the other areas outside Latin America. The haplotype networks suggested local diversification of pvmdr1 and no significant departure from neutrality. The F ST values were low to moderate regionally, but high between NIC-NE or NIC-NW and other regions inside and outside Latin America.
3:::The P4HB group (n = 31) experienced shorter drain time (10.0 vs 14.3 d; P < 0.002), fewer complications (22.6% vs 40.5%; P < 0.046), and reherniation (6.5% vs 23.8%; P < 0.049) than the porcine cadaveric mesh group (n = 42). Multivariate analysis for infection identified: porcine cadaveric mesh odds ratio 2.82, length of stay odds ratio 1.11; complications: drinker odds ratio 6.52, porcine cadaveric mesh odds ratio 4.03, African American odds ratio 3.08, length of stay odds ratio 1.11; and hernia recurrence: porcine cadaveric mesh odds ratio 5.18, drinker odds ratio 3.62, African American odds ratio 0.24. Cost analysis identified that P4HB had a $7328.91 financial advantage in initial hospitalization and $2241.17 in the 90-day postdischarge global period resulting in $9570.07 per case advantage over porcine cadaveric mesh.
3:::There were 231 patients with isolated rib fractures (132 men and 99 women). The mean age was 65 years. Rib fractures were most commonly diagnosed at the emergency department and most of the patients were referred to the department of thoracic surgery for follow-up evaluations. Of these 231 patients, 29 (12%) had DXA examinations after the injury, and only 9 (4%) of them did so within 6 months. Physicians specializing in orthopedic surgery, family medicine, internal medicine, rehabilitation medicine, and emergency medicine were ordering the examination.
3:::Group demographics were indistinguishable except for the number of robotically assisted procedures performed (p = 0.001). The mean scores of experienced subjects exceeded those of novices in dexterity (3.8 > 1.4, p < 0.001), field of view (4.1 > 1.8, p < 0.001), instrument visualization (3.9 > 2.2, p < 0.001), manipulator workspace (3.6 > 1.9, p = 0.001), and force sensitivity (4.3 > 2.6, p < 0.001). The mean scores of intermediate subjects exceeded those of novices in dexterity (2.8 > 1.4, p = 0.002), field of view (2.8 > 1.8, p = 0.021), instrument visualization (3.2 > 2.2, p = 0.045), manipulator workspace (3.1 > 1.9, p = 0.004), and force sensitivity (3.7 > 2.6, p = 0.033). The mean scores of experienced subjects exceeded those of intermediates in dexterity (3.8 > 2.8, p = 0.003), field of view (4.1 > 2.8, p < 0.001), and instrument visualization (3.9 > 3.2, p = 0.044). Rater agreement in each domain demonstrated statistically significant concordance (p < 0.05).
3:::Of the 76 journals, 89.5% were classified as predatory journals and the remaining as journals involved in predatory practices.
3:::Pathological analysis revealed that prostate cancer (PCa) was present in 45 and absent in 48 patients. In the whole group, there were 42 men with small prostate (TPV < 30 mL) and 51 with enlarged prostate (TPV ≥ 31 mL). The overall average tT level was 0.79 ± 0.66 ng/g, while the average tDHT level was 10.27 ± 7.15 ng/g. There were no differences in tT and tDHT level in prostates with and without PCa. However, tT and tDHT levels were significantly higher in larger, than in smaller prostates (tT: 1.05 ± 0.75 and 0.46 ± 0.29 ng/g, and tDHT: 15.0 ± 6.09 and 4.51 ± 2.75 ng/g, respectively). There were strong correlations between tT and TPV (r = 0.71), and tDHT and TPV (r = 0.74).
3:::Overall, 64 of the 96 centers (66.7%) completed the questionnaire. Most centers (98.4%) had been using OBT-A for >1 year. OBT-A was administered according to the PREEMPT paradigm in most centers (88.9%). While during the first year of prophylaxis with OBT-A most clinicians (93.6%) repeated OBT-A treatment every 3 months, as recommended, in the following years interval duration was variable. Response to OBT-A was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in the headache days by 58.7% of the clinicians, and as a ≥ 30% reduction by 25.4% of them. Almost 60% of the clinicians considered OBT-A as a long-lasting therapy, while for one-third of them treatment could be discontinued in patients showing a benefit for ≥6 months. According to 80% of the clinicians, early administration of OBT-A after the onset of chronic migraine was associated with better outcomes, and 47.6% felt that OBT-A should be recommended as a first-line option.
3:::Case of 35-year-old III gravida/II para with previously normal ongoing twin bichorionic biamniotic pregnancy in week 35+0, which was admitted to secondary care delivery room for three days lasting ""flu like"" symptoms and the right upper quadrant pain. She was icteric, exhausted, but normotensive (120/75 mm Hg). Acute caesarean section was performed for suspected fetal hypoxia and HELLP syndrome. The laboratory exams confirmed coagulopathy and HELLP syndrome second class during the operation. Blood loss was 800 ml. Despite standard treatment of HELLP syndrome, the condition had developed to renal insufficiency, bilateral fluidothorax, alveolar pulmonary edema, encephalopathy and hypertension. In laboratory results dominates markers of coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with presence of schistocytes. Due to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome with hemolysis of unclear origin, patient was transferred to referral hospital on sixth postoperative day. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPEX) was promptly begun. Improvement of laboratory parameters occurred already after the first TPEX and after two days there was a significant improvement of neurological status. Nine TPEX procedures were performed. The treatment was terminated after platelet count reached 100×109/l. She was discharged from hospital 21 days after delivery. After exclusion of other clinical entities, the case was closed as postpartum thrombotic microangiopathic syndrome.
3:::Based on the criteria described above we selected four cases out of 55 monochorionic pregnancies. One case of prenatally diagnosed spontaneous TAPS which fulfilled all the diagnostic criteria with typical angioarchitecture inclusive, one case of spontaneous TAPS diagnosed postnatally, a case of postlaser TAPS with a spontaneous resolution and one unusual case of feto-fetal haemorrhage which does not fully meet criteria of TAPS or aTTTS. All the pregnancies were delivered by caesarean section. All the anaemic neonates required blood transfusion postpartum and two of the polycythemic neonates needed partial exsanguination.
3:::The study showed no significant differences in all preoperative variables (P>0.05). While intraoperative blood loss and operative time in group 1 were increased compared to group 2, the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The height, relative depth and peripheral length of posterior wall respectively were 27.8±2.5mm (range: 24-35mm), 71.5±5.4% (range: 65-88%), 23.0±2.3mm (range: 17-28mm). The mean posterior wall fracture displacement is 5.0±3.2mm (range: 0-11mm). There was no difference regarding the quality of reduction between the two groups (P>0.05). The excellent to good clinical outcome was around 71.4% in the group 1 versus 73.4% in the group 2 at the final follow-up, this difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). There was no difference in rate of complications between the two groups (P>0.05).
3:::Eight guidelines were identified, two of which were updates. Lowest scoring AGREE II domains across all guidelines were rigour (6/8 poor, one fair, one average) and applicability (4/8 poor, one fair, three average). Two out of the three highest scoring guidelines were developed using AGREE II. No guideline fully met each IOM criterion and all raised at least one red flag indicative of potential bias. One updated guideline did not address seven of 16 items on CheckUp and the other did not address four. Patient involvement in guideline development was minimal.
3:::Social service professionals perceived fathers more negatively than did other professionals. Even though male professionals perceived fathers more negatively, they felt more confident working with them than did their female counterparts. Positive perceptions of fathers were associated with more favourable attitudes towards including them in family interventions, and this association was mediated by the professionals perceptions of their own self-efficacy.'
3:::The mean (SD) FOV percentage area seen from the anteromedial portal and anterolateral portal was 91.69% (3.63%) and 92.03% (3.93%), respectively, for the anterior humerus articular surface. There was no significant difference in the mean FOV percentage area seen from the anteromedial and anterolateral portals (p = 0.99). The mean (SD) FOV percentage area of the posterior humerus articular surface was 84.69% (2.28%). The mean (SD) FOV percentage area seen of the radial head and trochlear was 16.05% (2.66%) and 4.14% (1.76%), respectively.
3:::The VAS showed a significant reduction from the pre-injection score for all patients at day 1 and was maintained until week 6. Forty-one (35.3%) patients experienced post-injection pain. The mean duration of symptoms was 3.9 days. At 6 months, 81 (69.8%) patients were discharged successfully and, at a mean of 23.2 months, did not require re-referral; 29 (25%) had surgery; and six (5.2%) were referred for a spinal opinion.
3:::The mean surgical time was 130.71 ± 16.07 min, the mean estimated blood loss was 53.57 ± 48.43 ml, and the mean hospital stay was 6 days (range: 5-8 days). After a minimal 12-month follow-up (range: 12-36 months), the rate of anatomical success and the subjective satisfaction were 100% and 90.5%. The symptom severity, quality of life and sexual activity also presented significant improvement. In addition, no serious peri- and postoperative complications occurred.
3:::IL-1β increased inflammatory gene expression and NF-κB activation in primary murine-mixed glia, enriched astrocyte, and BMEC cultures. Although IL-1β elicited minimal changes in inflammatory gene expression and did not induce the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in isolated microglia, these cells were more robustly activated by IL-1β when co-cultured with astrocytes and/or BMEC. We observed a polarized endothelial response to IL-1β, because the application of IL-1β to the abluminal endothelial surface produced a more complex microglial inflammatory response than that which occurred following luminal IL-1β exposure.
3:::In total, 210 patients with PedsSNM were identified. Demographically, 54.3% were female, 72.6% were white, and the mean age was 10.7 years. Overall incidence was 0.036 per 100,000 individuals between the years of 2000 and 2013. The nasal cavity was the most frequent primary site (37.1%) and rhabdomyosarcoma was the most frequent malignancy (50.5%). Five-, 10-, and 20-year disease-specific survival (DSS) rates were 60.2%, 46.1%, and 20.6%, respectively. Grade IV tumors made up the largest group (37.3%), and such tumors exhibited the worst 5-, 10-, and 20-year survival (P < 0.05). Distant disease predicted the worst 5-, 10-, and 20-year survival, followed by regional, then localized disease (P < 0.01). Patients treated with surgery alone had a higher 20-year survival (P = 0.0425). No significant differences in survival were observed between race, gender, primary site, or histology.
3:::A total of 561 patients with influenza (15.9% with asthma) and 1258 patients without influenza (8.0% with asthma) were included as cases and controls, respectively. The adjusted risk of influenza for patients with asthma was calculated by multivariate conditional logistic regression. The adjustment variables were the following: smoker/nonsmoker, pneumonia in the 2 years before hospital admission, previous oral treatment with corticosteroids, influenza vaccination during the seasonal campaign, Barthel index (ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living), level of education, obesity, and the presence of other comorbidities. Patients with asthma presented a great risk of influenza (adjusted odds ratio 2.64 [95% confidence interval, 1.77-3.94]). Compared with patients without asthma, patients with asthma had more symptoms, and these had been present for longer before admission but presented a lower hospital or postdischarge mortality.
3:::The average follow-up time was 6 years, ranging from 1 to 14 years. There was a functionally patent choanae in 94% of children, and 6% showed severe restenosis with a diameter less than 4 mm, which needed one revision surgery each. Charge patients were not associated with worse outcome. There was no external nasal valve stenosis and no permanent Eustachian tube dysfunction. Synechiae occurred in 3 patients with hyperplastic inferior turbinate. No patients showed any disharmonious nasal growth. In neonates with isolated bilateral CCA, breast-suction could be started within 1 day (range 1-2 days), and pain-killers were needed on average for 1.5 days (range 1-4 days). The hospital stay for unilateral isolated CCA was on average 1.5 days (range 1-2 days) and for bilateral isolated CCA, 8 days (range 3-20 days). Postoperative procedures under a short general anesthesia were necessary in 12 cases, 10 of them were infants under 6 months of age.
3:::No differences in radio loudness based on the sex of the driver were found. Statistically significant differences were identified in preferred signal to noise ratio among multiple vehicular paradigms, with the youngest generation preferring the largest signal to noise ratio in conditions with low background noise.
3:::Based on the AEDS symptom records from 87,879 person-days, the mean symptom score difference from baseline in patients with AEDS increased significantly in spring, autumn, and winter relative to the reference season (summer): by 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.81) in spring, by 0.45 (95% CI, 0.24-0.67) in winter, and by 0.18 (95% CI, 0.02-0.36) in autumn. The mean symptom score difference from baseline increased significantly in January, February, March, April, May, June, October, November, and December relative to the reference month of August.
3:::The mean screening rate for hearing loss was 53.6% (7403 of 13805 newborns), which plateaued at 79.6% over time. Of the 14806 ears (7403 newborns), 1030 (7.0%) were assessed as ""refer"" on the first AABR, with 204 (1.4%) being assessed as ""refer"" on the second AABR. In hearing confirmation tests, 74 infants (1.0% of 7403 newborns) were diagnosed with hearing loss, including 13 infants (0.2%) with bilateral moderate to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Hearing rehabilitation with long-term follow-up was confirmed in 11 infants.
3:::In a univariate analysis, the factors significantly associated with SR were lower body mass index (BMI); younger age; a higher number of allergens in the extracts; and the presence of cat, dust mite, and certain weed pollens. In a multivariate analysis, cat, dust mite, and mugwort were significantly associated with SRs. Over the 10-year period, 50 patients experienced SRs (13.81%), with a total number of 68 SRs. Only 4.7% of the SRs occurred on the MERIT day. Most SRs occurred >30 minutes and were mild. Our MERIT protocol continuation rate for all the patients was 49.2% and did not seem to be influenced by having an SR versus no SR.
3:::The application of earmuffs could decrease the rate of the heart and respiratory while could increase the amount of oxygen saturation (p < 0.05). The results also showed that the preterm infants with earmuffs had lower ABSS score and a better light sleep compared to those without earmuffs (2.38 ± 0.47 versus 4.8 ± 0.97, p < 0.05).
3:::Mutations (homozygote or compound heterozygote) in GJB2 accounted for 8.9% (34/380) of the patients, mutations in SLC26A4 accounted for 10.0% (38/380) of the patients screened. Only one case was found to carry 12S rRNA 1555A > G (1/380, 0.26%). Five types of mutations in GJB2 were identified, GJB2 235delC was the most prevalent mutation in our patient group (76/380, 20.0%), followed by 299-300delAT with a frequency of 7.4% (28/380). Two types of mutations in SLC26A4 were detected in our patient group (IVS7-2A > G and 2168A > G). IVS7-2A > G was identified in 27 patients (27/380, 7.1%) and 2168A > G was identified in 14 patients (14/380, 3.7%).
3:::Two hundred thirty-six patients were included, with a mean follow-up duration of 470 days. The mean age was 85.9 years. Seventy-five patients died during the follow-up period. One hundred nineteen patients (50.4%) had an EFS score of 0-3, 68 patients (28.8%) had an EFS score of 4-6, and 49 patients (20.8%) had an EFS score ≥ 7. The all-cause mortality rate was 17.7% in the EFS 0-3 group, 35.3% in the EFS 4-6 group, and 61.2% in the EFS ≥ 7 group (P < 0.001). After multivariate analysis, frailty status remained associated with all-cause mortality: the hazard ratio (HR) was 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-3.16) in the EFS 4-6 group, and the HR was 3.60 (95% CI, 1.70-7.63) in the EFS ≥ 7 group.
3:::A significant correlation between blood eosinophils assessed by the 2 devices was found (R(2) = 0.854, P < .001); similar correlations were found also for white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. The point-of-care device had the ability to predict blood eosinophil cutoffs used to select patients for biologic treatments for severe eosinophilic asthma and the ELEN index, a composite score useful to predict sputum eosinophilia.
3:::Almost all respondents (n = 47; 94%) were using C1-INH(IV) for HAE prophylaxis. Most patients reported administration of C1-INH(IV) through a peripheral vein (n = 34) and 19 were currently (n = 17) or previously (n = 2) using a central venous port. Most respondents (62%) who used a peripheral vein to administer treatment reported having difficulty finding a usable vein or getting the infusion to work properly at least some of the time. Issues accessing veins, exhausted veins, and frequency of attacks were the main reasons physicians recommended ports to respondents. Although ports allow easier administration of therapy, 47% of respondents with ports experienced problems such as occlusion, thrombosis, and infection. Respondents using C1-INH prophylaxis reported a mean of 2.3 attacks per month during the previous 6 months.
3:::A difference in FEV1 and PNIF reduction was detected between misoprostol and placebo (P = .03) and misoprostol and historical controls (P = .01), respectively, during nasal ketorolac challenge. No difference was detected among aspirin reactors. Among all reactors, no difference in magnitude was found for FEV1 (P = .13) or PNIF (P = .07) reduction across all 3 groups. Total treatment requirement was similar (P = .14). Patients receiving misoprostol were more likely to report adverse gastrointestinal effects (P = .02).
3:::All patients underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery with an improvement in symptoms after surgery. Diplopia disappeared in two patients who presented with it and enophthalmos improved in all five patients presenting with it. Only one patient out of four presenting with headache had a persistence of the symptoms which were, however, milder than they had been preoperatively. Endoscopic examination demonstrated a reventilated maxillary sinus in all cases. A radiological examination at follow-up was performed in 5 cases and demonstrated a reexpansion of the maxillary sinus as compared to the contralateral side in all patients except one. None of the patients required an orbital floor reconstruction. Eleven similar cases reported in the literature were analyzed and compared.
3:::Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria with a median sample size of 157 (range 26-1735) and published between 1992 and 2015. The most common study design was a case series. Most studies included multiple patients at high risk for respiratory complications (Syndromic, obese, etc.). The summary estimate of the major respiratory complication rate following T/A was only 5.8% (95% CI = 4.2-7.4%, p < 0.001, I(2) = 99%). For studies with extractable data, 102 of 112 patients (91.1%) with a post-operative respiratory complication had a clearly identifiable clinical risk factor, the remainder (8.9%) had only moderate or severe OSAS on PSG and no other predictor.
3:::Estimated prevalence of CMHPs peaks in 45-49-year-olds (20.59% of population). The proportions of patients identified with CMHPs being referred peaks at 20-24 years (22.95%) and reduces with increase in age thereafter to 6.00% for 70-74-year-olds. Once referred, the proportion of those attending first treatment increases with age between 20 years (57.34%) and 64 years (76.97%). In addition, the percentage of those having a clinical improvement gradually increases from the age of 18 years (12.94%) to 69 years (20.74%).
3:::A total of 18,833 patients met inclusion criteria, with an overall rate of venous thromboembolism of 3.8. Among procedure risk groups, venous thromboembolism rates were high risk, 4.4%; intermediate risk, 1.6%; and low risk, 0.7% (across risk groups, p < 0.01). Emergent case subjects exhibited a higher rate of venous thromboembolism than their elective counterparts (6.9% vs 3.1%). Factors significantly associated with venous thromboembolism on adjusted analysis included emergent risk case (adjusted OR = 7.85), high-risk elective case (adjusted OR = 5.07), intermediate-risk elective case (adjusted OR = 2.69), steroid use (adjusted OR = 1.54), and preoperative albumin <3.5 g/dL (adjusted OR = 1.45).
3:::In a well-fitting multivariable analysis (R(2) = 0.71), variables significantly associated with a higher global satisfaction score were ""sufficient information given about treatment"" (β = 0.86, 95% CI 0.01-1.70, p = 0.047), ""sufficient explanation of risks and benefits of surgery"" (β = 1.26, 95% CI 0.18-2.34, p = 0.020), ""absence of night-time noise"" (β = 1.35, 95% CI 0.56-2.14, p = 0.001) and ""confidence and trust in nurses"" (β = 1.51, 95% CI 0.54-2.49, p = 0.003).
3:::We demonstrate that RanBPM-mediated inhibition of HDAC6 is dependent on its association with HDAC6. We show that, while HDAC6 does not require RanBPM to associate with microtubules, RanBPM association with microtubules requires HDAC6. Additionally, we show that Twa1 (Two-hybrid-associated protein 1 with RanBPM) and MAEA (Macrophage Erythroblast Attacher), two CTLH complex members, also associate with α-tubulin and that muskelin, another component of the CTLH complex, is able to associate with HDAC6. Downregulation of CTLH complex members muskelin and Rmnd5A (Required for meiotic nuclear division homolog A) resulted in decreased acetylation of HDAC6 substrate α-tubulin. Finally, we demonstrate that the increased cell migration resulting from downregulation of RanBPM is due to the relief in inhibition of HDAC6 α-tubulin deacetylase activity.
3:::SLE patients had more MPs and IgG positive MPs than controls, however, β2 GPI-positive MPs were higher in controls. We observed less β2 GPI-positive MPs among aPL/anti-β2 GPI positive patients, compared to aPL/anti-β2 GPI negative patients and controls (roughly 2 times). β2 GPI levels in plasma did not differ with aPL/anti-β2 GPI status in patients, however controls had slightly higher levels of β2 GPI compared to aPL/anti-β2 GPI positive patients. In vitro experiments revealed that β2 GPI preferentially binds to PS positive MPs.
3:::There was a statistically significant improvement in both Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) and Disability Arm Shoulder Hand Scores (Quick DASH) in the first 4 weeks after the procedure, which was maintained but not improved to the end of the study period. Patients presenting with pain, those who had a history of steroid injections and older patients all had worse functional scores at presentation. Diabetes (both Type I and II), previous physiotherapy, length of history and whether pain or stiffness, or both, were the predominant symptom did not have any statistical significance at presentation. These factors were not predictors of any statistically significant improvement in functional scores.
3:::During the 14-month study period, 1334 radial PCIs were attempted. Twenty-six patients switched to femoral at an early stage, while 76 encountered radial spasm and underwent successful BAT in 69 cases (91%), giving a total crossover rate to femoral of 33/1334 (2.5%). Utilizing BAT rather than a femoral puncture reduced our institutions radial-femoral crossover rate from 7.6% to 2.5% (P<.01), which is also significantly lower than the radial-femoral crossover rate in the 12 months before BAT implementation (6.1%; P<.01). Mean procedure times were similar for those requiring BAT compared with conventional radial access (51.3 ± 21.3 min vs 47.9 ± 23.7 min; P=.23), and those crossing straight to femoral (BAT not attempted) (60.7 ± 31.9 min; P=.10). Mean first device/balloon time for the BAT-assisted primary PCI cases (22.6 ± 9.4 min) was similar to cases that had radial difficulties and converted to femoral without attempting BAT (25.8 ± 13.4 min; P=.54).'
3:::HucMSC-CM significantly reduced the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased the activity of glutathione (GSH) induced by UUO. Moreover, CM significantly reduced the expression of TGF-β1, α-SMA, TNF-α and Collagen-I in UUO kidney, promoted the proliferation of RTEs and inhibited its apoptosis. In addition, the increased expression of E-cadherin also reflects the effective improvement of renal interstitial fibrosis.
3:::Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging data showed that postischemic MRE-269 treatment significantly reduced infarct volume compared with vehicle-treated rats at both 48 hours and 3 weeks after stroke. MRE-269 treatment resulted in a significant long-term recovery in both locomotor and somatosensory functions after middle cerebral artery occlusion, which was associated with a reduced weight loss in animals receiving the IP receptor agonist. Postischemic MRE-269 treatment reduced proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and oxidative stress. Damage to the blood-brain barrier, as assessed by extravasation of immunoglobulin G to the ischemic brain, was significantly reduced by MRE-269, which was associated with a reduction in matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity in the brain of stroked aged rats given the IP agonist at 4.5 hours after ischemia onset.
3:::Frailty prevalence estimates were 87.1% (FI), 50% (FRAIL), 80% (TFI), and 81% (CFS). Area under receiver operator characteristics against FI ranged from 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-0.90: FRAIL] to 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.95: CFS), with no significant difference on receiver operating characteristic curve contrast. Frailty, as defined by FRAIL score ≥3, was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (6.7% vs 1.0%, P = .031) and length of hospitalization [10 days (6.0-17.5) vs 8 days (5.0-14.0), P = .043]. FI [odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, 95% CI 1.00-1.33, P = .05], FRAIL (OR = 3.31, 95% CI 1.43-7.67, P = .005), and CFS (OR = 2.57, 95% CI 1.14-5.83, P = .023) independently predicted in-hospital mortality adjusted for age, sex, and severity of illness.
3:::We discovered a core-cluster of 30 miRNAs that were highly expressed in all the cases and a cluster of 993 miRNAs that were uniformly absent in all cases. Another 1022 miRNA were variably present in the samples reflecting heterogeneity between tumors. We explored mRNA targets, pathways and biological processes affected by some of these miRNAs. We propose that the core-cluster of 30 miRs represent miRNA machinery common to all Rb, and affecting most pathways considered hallmarks of cancer. In this core, we identified miR-3613 as a potential and critical down regulatory hub, because it is highly expressed in all the samples and its potential mRNA targets include at least 36 tumor suppressor genes, including RB1. In the variably expressed miRNA, 36 were differentially expressed between males and females. Some of the potential pathways targeted by these 36 miRNAs were associated with hormonal production.
3:::No behavioral changes, toxic symptoms or death was observed in rats throughout the dosing period. Cultivated FBOS treatment up to 1000mg/kg did not cause any adverse effect on the growth of the animals. Results from haematology and serum biochemistry revealed no toxic effect following cultivated FBOS treatment at three graded doses for 28 days. In addition, no treatment related histopathological changes were noted in heart, spleen, kidney, lung and liver of the animals.
3:::M%NRAS was increased in 27.9% of cases. FISH revealed that chromosome 1 instability was the predominant mechanism of M%NRAS increase, with chromosome 1 polysomy observed in 28.6% of cases and intra-tumor cellular heterogeneity with copy number variations of chromosome 1/NRAS in 23.8%. Acquired copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was less frequent (19%). However, most samples with high M%NRAS had only one copy of NRAS locus surrounding regions suggesting a WT allele loss. Clinical characteristics and survival of patients with either <60% or ≥60% of M%NRAS were not different.
3:::The most important non-technical skills described by the VATS teams were planning and preparation, situation awareness, problem solving, leadership, risk assessment, and teamwork. These non-technical skills enabled the team to achieve shared mental models, which in turn facilitated their efforts to anticipate next steps. This was viewed as important by the participants as they saw VATS lobectomy as a high-risk procedure with complementary and overlapping scopes of practice between surgical and anesthesia subteams.
3:::Twenty or 40 days of treatment with BSYSC increased markedly PGP9.5 and GAP-43 levels, reduced p-Tau in the brain or spinal cord of mice with EAE. In addition, BSYSC elevated significantly the expression of KI67 and Nestin in the spinal cord 40 dpi. Further study showed that the activation of NogoA/NgR and RhoA/ROCK were suppressed by the presence of BSYSC.
3:::In a total of 85 patients, FALEC expression was significantly increased in clinical PCa tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, and can be considered as an independent prognostic factor in patients with PCa. Downregulation of FALEC could inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. In vivo tumorigenesis study and orthotopic bioluminescence image also support the evidence that FALEC may promote the progression of prostate cancer. We also find FALEC is a potential hypoxia induced lncRNA and can be induced by the hypoxia master regulator HIF-1α.
3:::Overall, VAS and ADL scores showed a progressive decrease during the follow-up (P < 0.01 at all visits for both groups), without significant differences between groups. The TSK score decreased significantly more in the HA group than in the control group (3.6 vs. 2.4; P < 0.001). Patients in the control group needed more rehabilitation sessions (28 vs. 22 in the HA group; P = 0.006) and more days for returning to their pre-injury activity (32 vs. 20 in the HA group; P = 0.013). Both patients and investigators perceived higher efficacy in the HA group than in the control group (P = 0.034). Both treatments were safe and well tolerated.
3:::Mean hip internal rotation increased from 19.1 to 21.9° (p = 0.04, Δ2.8°, SD 2.7) after ACH surgery. Mean adduction of 3.9° before and 2.7° after ACH surgery was unchanged (p = 0.48, Δ-1.2°; SD 4.3). Mean flexion angles during dRSA tests were 82.4° before and 80.8° after ACH surgery, which were similar (p = 0.18, Δ-1.6°, SD = 2.7). No correlation between volume of removed bone and ROM was observed.
3:::Multivariable models show that women who lived in communities with at least 1-5 years of a clinical social franchise intrauterine device (IUD) program had 4.770 higher odds of using a modern contraceptive method compared to women living in communities with no IUD program [CI: 3.739-6.084]. Townships where the reproductive health program had existed for at least 10 years had 1.428 higher odds of reporting modern method use compared to women living in townships where the programs had existed for less than 10 years [CI: 1.016-2.008].
3:::The series comprised 47 males and 18 females. The average age of the patients was 4.9 years old. All patients had typical clinical manifestations, and intussusception was proven by ultrasound. Fifty-one patients had recurrent intussusception, of whom 21 had one, 14 had two, 10 had three, and 6 had more than three. There were 20 episodes of recurrence within 24 h (39.2%), 15 episodes were found between 24 and 72 h (29.4%), and the remaining 31.4% (16/51) of recurrences occurred after 72 h. All patients received surgical intussusception reduction. Meanwhile, enterectomy was the procedure of choice in 55 patients, polypectomy in 5 patients, and cystectomy in 3 patients. The types of intussusception secondary to PLPs included small intestinal (n = 25), ileocolic (n = 19), ileocecal (n = 11), ileo-ileocolic (n = 9) and cecalcolic (n = 1). The types of PLPs included Meckel diverticulum (n = 32), intestinal duplication (n = 14), benign polyps (n = 5), malignant lymphoma (n = 4), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (n = 3), mesenteric cyst (n = 3), intestinal wall hematoma of hemophilia (n = 2), allergic purpura (n = 1), and hamartoma (n = 1). All patients recovered well with no relapse during follow-up, except for one patient who had an intestinal obstruction from adhesions that occurred approximately 3 months after discharge and who was curable after conservative treatment.
3:::During the study period, 107 children had 174 episodes of silicone Sitimplant (Vygon, Ecouen, France) Port-A-Cath insertions. These children required 135 removal episodes and there were 3 (2.2%) instances whereby the catheter fragment was retained. These episodes of retained catheters only occurred in children with factor VIII deficiency (4.1% incidence in this cohort). For each episode of catheter insertion and removal, the catheters had been left in situ for a mean duration of 43 months in children with factor deficiency and no retained fragments, and the mean duration was 91 months in children with factor deficiency and retained catheter fragments (p = 0.0011).
3:::Among patient randomized to active treatment, magnesium levels in the first 72 hours were assessed 987 times in 572 patients. Mean patient age was 70 years (SD±14 years), and 45% were women. During the 24-hour period of active infusion, mean achieved serum level was 3.91 (±0.8), consistent with trial target. Mg levels were increased by older age, female sex, lower weight, height, body mass index, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, and higher blood urea nitrogen, hemoglobin, and higher hematocrit. Adjusted odds for clinical outcomes did not differ by achieved Mg level, including disability at 90 days, symptomatic hemorrhage, or death.
3:::A total of 40,446 patients were analyzed: 13,219 (32.7%), 13,935 (34.5%), and 1572 (3.9%) in the no-preparation, mechanical bowel preparation alone, and oral antibiotic preparation alone groups, and 11,720 (29.0%) in the combined preparation group. After matching, 9800, 1461, and 8819 patients remained in the mechanical preparation, oral antibiotic preparation, and combined preparation groups for comparison with patients without preparation. On conditional logistic regression of matched patients, oral antibiotic preparation alone was protective of surgical site infection (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.87), anastomotic leak (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.34-0.97), ileus (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.59-0.98), and major morbidity (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.96), but not mortality (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.08-1.18), whereas a regimen of combined oral antibiotics and mechanical bowel preparation was protective for all 5 major outcomes. When directly compared with oral antibiotic preparation alone, the combined regimen was not associated with any difference in any of the 5 postoperative outcomes.
3:::Between October 2012 and March 2016, a total of 3,949 women met inclusion criteria and were diagnosed with false labor, discharged, and returned to deliver, whereas 2,592 similar women were admitted in early labor. The mean interval from discharge to return was 4.9 days. Cesarean delivery rates were not different between the study groups-11% for both (P=.69), and the perinatal composite outcome rates were not significantly different between those sent home and those admitted-3.2% compared with 3.1% (P=.79). Women with more advanced cervical dilatation at discharge returned and delivered significantly earlier than those with less dilatation regardless of parity.
3:::From June to August 2015, a total of 100 women were randomized: 50 to early and 50 to conventional postpartum etonogestrel insertion. Sociodemographic characteristics were similar between the groups, except for educational attainment. The conventional insertion group included a higher proportion of women with 8 or more years of formal education than the early insertion group (88% [44/50] compared with 70% [35/50], P=.02). There was no difference in infant weight at 360 days between the groups (early [mean±standard deviation] 10.1±1.2 kg compared with conventional 9.8±1.3 kg, mean difference estimate 0.3 kg, 95% confidence interval 0-0.7 kg). Growth curves, height, and head and arm circumferences did not differ between the groups.
3:::Important differences existed between the students and nurse educators' perspectives on hindrances to the students' success. Nurse educators saw the biggest hindrance as language proficiency, whereas students saw it as lack of relationships with faculty and classmates.'
3:::Students with higher stress scores had a higher incidence of substance use. Most students who had higher perceptions of faculty support tended to use fewer nonprescribed stimulants for academic enhancement.
3:::Parenting stress mediated the association between attachment and schizotypy, though parenting competence did not have a significant effect as a mediator in a parallel model. Childhood trauma was associated with attachment and schizotypy but did not correlate with the parenting variables.
3:::Meditation demonstrated moderate strength for enhancing executive attention, F = 4.26 (1, 49), n(2) = .080, p = .044. Additional outcomes specific to the meditation group were reduced stress and increased mindfulness, F = 7.16 (2, 47), n(2) = .234, p = .002.
3:::Overall survival (median time) was significantly lower for patients referred by the 2ww' pathway (3.5 years, 95% CI: 2.7-4.30), in comparison to the 'routine' (5.4 years, 95% CI: 4.5-6.6) pathway (p < 0.001). Patients referred on the '2ww' pathway were 1.34 times more likely to have stage IV disease at presentation in comparison to patients referred by the 'routine' pathway. Comparison of referral to initial treatment times showed there was no significant difference in survival between the <62days group and the >62days group (7.1 vs. 6.54, p = 0.620).'
3:::Course evaluations indicated student appreciation for the new content and practicum experiences provided. Students felt the new content to be essential in their development as expert practitioners.
3:::Only a very small number (12%) of hospitals incorporated HIE as a primary tool for evidence-based readmission reduction initiatives. Information exchange between providers has been suggested to play a key role in reducing avoidable readmission rates, yet there is not currently evidence supporting current HIE-enabled readmission initiatives. Most successful readmission reduction programs demonstrate collaboration with primary care providers to augment transitions of care to existing care management functions without additional staff while using effective information exchange capabilities.
3:::405 (64%) responses were received - from 338 (62%) GPs and 67 (71%) PMs. Familiarity and engagement were highest for local frail elderly and end of life care projects (>76% had used). The greatest difference in use concerned the now suspended national care.data initiative: PMs had odds of reporting use 75 times higher than GP partners (95% CI 27-211). Patient confusion was the most pronounced challenge and improved coordination the most pronounced expected benefit. Frequency of discussions with patients varied with IT competence (OR 4.2 for most competent users relative to least, 95% CI 1.7-10.7) and clinical system (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.5). Patient reservations were reported more frequently by respondents who rated their IT competence as highest (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5-7.6), perceived more data sharing challenges (OR for a 1-point increase in challenges perception score 3.4, 95% CI 2.1-5.6) and by PMs (relative to GP partners, OR 18.0, 95% CI 7.9-41.3).
3:::Seventy-four participants (57 women [77.1%], 17 men [22.9%]) of 97 completed the program (76.3% completion rate). Body weight (P<.001); percentage of body fat (P<.001); fat mass (P<.001); body mass index (P<.001); waist circumference (P<.001); blood levels of high-density lipoprotein (P=.035), low-density lipoprotein (P=.011), and glucose (P=.008); serum triglyceride levels (P=.019); blood pressure (systolic P=.028; diastolic, P=.001); and maximal oxygen consumption (P<.001) improved from baseline to 1 year after the intervention. Lean body mass (P=.111) and total cholesterol (P=.053) did not improve.
3:::User-centered design practices for clinical decision support varied across clinics: 74% conducted pilot testing, 62% conducted provider satisfaction assessment, 36% conducted a formal usability assessment, and 79% conducted an analysis of impact on performance improvement. Overall perceived utility of clinical decision support was high, with a mean rating of 4.17 (±.67) out of 5 on a composite measure. ""Analysis of impact on performance improvement"" was the only user-centered design practice significantly associated with perceived utility of clinical decision support, b=.47 (p<.001). This association was present in hospital-based clinics, b=.34 (p<.05), but was stronger at community-based clinics, b=.61 (p<.001).
3:::A total of 12,804 patients from FRANCE TAVI and 4,165 patients from FRANCE 2 were included in this analysis. The median age of patients was 84.6 years, and 49.7% were men. FRANCE TAVI participants were older but at lower surgical risk (median logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation [EuroSCORE]: 15.0% vs. 18.4%; p < 0.001). More than 80% of patients in FRANCE TAVI underwent transfemoral TAVR. Transesophageal echocardiography guidance decreased from 60.7% to 32.3% of cases, whereas more recent procedures were increasingly performed in hybrid operating rooms (15.8% vs. 35.7%). Rates of Valve Academic Research Consortium-defined device success increased from 95.3% in FRANCE 2 to 96.8% in FRANCE TAVI (p < 0.001). In-hospital and 30-day mortality rates were 4.4% and 5.4%, respectively, in FRANCE TAVI compared with 8.2% and 10.1%, respectively, in FRANCE 2 (p < 0.001 for both). Stroke and potentially life-threatening complications, such as annulus rupture or aortic dissection, remained stable over time, whereas rates of cardiac tamponade and pacemaker implantation significantly increased.
3:::Health Behaviour of the consumers influences Health Information Seeking Behaviour. And this relationship is strongly affected by Gender whereby the affect is strongly among females compared to males.
3:::The overall Pearson correlation between GDT and ORC was r=0.87 (p <0.001), while between ORC and EC according the Ministry of Health (MH) was r=0.33 (p<0.001). After clustering data in epidemic and non-epidemic weeks in comparison with GDT correlation were r=0.86 (p<0.001) and r=0.65 (p <0.001) respectively. Important interannual variation of the epidemic was observed. The model shows a high accuracy in comparison with the EC, particularly when the incidence of the disease is higher.
3:::The proposed method was able to identify 23 possible issues in the original document (ambiguities, omissions, redundant information, and inaccuracies, among others). The formal verification process aided the specialists to consider a wider range of usage scenarios and to identify which instructions form the kernel of the proposed SOP and which ones represent additional or required knowledge that are mandatory for the correct application of the medical document.
3:::The relative change in mean vessel area was significantly greater with the BVS compared to the DES (6.7 ± 12.6% vs. 2.9 ± 11.5%; p = 0.003); the relative change in mean lumen area was significantly different between the 2 arms (1.4 ± 19.1% vs. -1.9 ± 10.5%, respectively; p = 0.031). Multivariate analysis indicated that use of the BVS, female sex, balloon-artery ratio >1.25, expansion index ≥0.8, previous percutaneous coronary intervention, and higher level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were independent predictors of expansive remodeling. Furthermore, in the BVS arm, necrotic core pre-procedure was an independent determinant of expansive remodeling.
3:::We included 96 patients with 97 pregnancies. The age was 30 (26-34) years and BMI 28 (24-31). Median length of pregnancy at first admission was 23 (13-31) weeks. The three most common diagnoses were biliary colic (n = 63), cholecystitis (n = 22) and acute pancreatitis (n = 16). Conservative treatment was practiced in 62 (64%) patients and intervention in 35 (36%). Conservatively treated patients were admitted later during pregnancy (week 26 (20-33) versus 17 (10-22), p < .001). Surgically treated patients had a longer total length of stay (all admissions) than conservatively treated patients (p = .001), less readmissions (p = .001) and equal birth outcome. Surgical intervention was more common in the later time period (48% versus 22%, p = .011). Of the conservatively treated patients, 56% were subjected to surgical intervention within 2 years after delivery.
3:::The participants mean age was 29.37 years (SD ± 4.71) and the average duration gestation was 28.81 weeks (SD = 5.05). Depressed women tended to get marry earlier (M = 21.07, SD = 3.47) than the non-depressed group (M = 22.55, SD = 3.36) (p = 0.012) and they had higher number of lifetime gestations (M = 3.31, SD = 2.06) than their non-depressed counterparts (M = 2.33, SD = 1.26) (p = 0.001). Each abuse and neglect score helped to predict the participants' depression scores.'
3:::A total of 180 patients were included, of which 110 for the reliability analysis. Fifty-nine patients (33%) had neuropathic pain according to the reference test. Both the painDETECT and DN4 had moderate sensitivity of respectively 75% (95% CI: 61.6-85.0) and 76% (95% CI: 63.4-86.4) and poor specificity of respectively 51% (95% CI: 42.0-60.4) and 42% (95% CI: 33.2-51.5). Combining negative test results for both screening tools increased the sensitivity up to 83% (95% CI: 71.0-91.6). The ICC for the painDETECT was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86-0.94) and for the DN4 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.91).
3:::Among 184,161 patients with newly diagnosed AF (age 70 ± 11 years; 1.7% women; CHA2DS2-VASc score 2.6 ± 1.7), 40% received cardiology care and 60% received primary care only. After adjustment for covariates, cardiology care was associated with reductions in stroke (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86 to 0.96; p < 0.001) and death (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.91; p < 0.0001) and increases in hospitalizations for AF/supraventricular tachycardia (HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.35 to 1.42; p < 0.0001) and myocardial infarction (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.05; p < 0.04). The propensity-matched cohort had similar results. In mediation analysis, oral anticoagulation prescription within 90 days of diagnosis may have mediated reductions in stroke but did not mediate reductions in survival.
3:::A total of 8 eyes of 5 patients developed a fixed and dilated pupil after TSCPC, unresponsive to light. A mydriatic pupil could still be observed at least 6 months after treatment in 7 of 8 eyes; however, it was asymptomatic.
3:::There were no significant differences in stigmatizing attitudes and behavior across the 3 conditions. However, once the data were split by sex, men exposed to the hope condition had significantly higher stigmatizing attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS than men in the other 2 conditions.
3:::An exploratory factor analysis with promax rotation as well as confirmatory factor analyses revealed a three-factor solution of Externalizing, Anxiety, and Mood syndromes, with a higher order Internalizing factor comprised of the Mood and Anxiety factors.
3:::Consistent with prior research, 50% of youth met criteria for a co-occurring anxiety or depressive disorder. Rates of externalizing disorders were lower (16%). Developmental differences emerged such that older youth met criteria for a higher number of co-occurring disorders. As expected, adolescents in particular were more likely to have a co-occurring internalizing disorder compared to early or pre-adolescent peers. Surprisingly, they were also more likely to have a comorbid externalizing disorder. Developmental trends were particularly striking with respect to depression, with adolescents with OCD demonstrating a six-fold greater likelihood of co-occurring depressive disorder compared to younger counterparts.
3:::Consistent with previous results, extinction and cue-induced reinstatement were attenuated in adolescent-onset groups compared with adults; this age difference also extended to drug-primed reinstatement. In support of the present hypothesis, an impoverished environment during abstinence increased reinstatement among adolescents to levels that were not different from adult standard-housing levels.
3:::Of 375 HIV-negative MSM enrolled in Amsterdam PrEP, 18 (4.8%, 95% confidence interval 2.9-7.5%) of participants were anti-HCV and/or HCV RNA positive at enrolment; 15 of 18 (83%) had detectable HCV RNA. HCV genotyping showed genotype 1a (73%), 4d (20%), and 2b (7%). All HCV-positive MSM starting PrEP were part of MSM-specific HCV clusters containing MSM with and without HIV.
3:::Three compounds were isolated and identified: a sterol, (1) stigmasterol-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside; a pregnane glucoside, (2) pregn-5-ene-3β,16β,20(R)-trio1-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside; a furostanol saponin, (3) 26-(O-β-d-glucopyranosyl)-22-O-methylfurost-5-ene-3β,26-diol-3-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 4)-[α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 2)]-β-d-glucopyranoside. Only compound 3 possessed significant AG and AR inhibitory activities (IC50 = 3.12 ± 0.17 and 1.04 ± 0.02 μg/mL, respectively), while compounds 1 and 2 were inactive. The in vivo antidiabetic study revealed that MeEx and furostanol saponin 3 possessed significant activities at a dose of 200 mg/kg through reducing the fasting plasma glucose level by 46.14% and 51.39%, respectively, as well as reducing the total cholesterol by 24.44% and 31.90%, respectively. Compound 3 also caused increment in insulin and C-peptide levels by 63.56% and 65%, respectively.
3:::Increases in excessive alcohol consumption among women, sleep problems among men, and smoking, insufficient sleep duration and poor self-reported health for both genders were observed in the French working population between 2006 and 2010. Some differential changes were observed, negative changes being more likely to affect young workers and workers with a permanent contract.
3:::In the F1 3xTg-AD/C3H animal model of AD, there was no detectable reduction of brain volume over a period of 10months of treatment, as there was not brain atrophy in any of the placebo or treatment groups. Laquinimod had no detectable effects on most neurobehavioral outcomes. The number or composition of CNS intrinsic cells and mononuclear subsets isolated from the CNS were not altered by laquinimod.
3:::Between 1967 and 2012, LE increased for both NT Aboriginal and all Australians; the difference in LE between the two populations declined by 4.6 years for females, but increased by one year for males. Between 1967-1971 and 1980-1984, LE of NT Aboriginal people increased rapidly, particularly through reduced infant mortality; from 1980-1984 to 1994-1998, there was little change; from 1994-1998 to 2008-2012, there were modest gains in older age groups. Decomposition by age group identified the persistent and substantial contribution of the 35-74-year age groups to the difference in LE between NT Aboriginal people and all Australians.
3:::It was found that there was no single meaning of CATM among the Indonesian community of psychology. Participants were not familiar enough with the terms and tended to use them with overlap. It can be suggested that ""complementary medicine"" and ""alternative medicine"" or ""complementary-alternative medicine"" combined provides more suitable terminology for use among Indonesian psychology community when communicating with other health care professionals.
3:::Retention was 90%. Over long-term maintenance, there was a decline in PA, but levels remained significantly higher than baseline for moderate/vigorous PA (p < .001), leisure moderate/vigorous PA (p < .001) and walking (p = .006). Variations by condition/site were not statistically significant.
3:::The RBC catalase concentration was significantly decreased in the DM1 and DM1 + VA groups when compared with the normal control. DM1 + OG significantly increased RBC-catalase when compared to DM1. The methemoglobin concentration was significantly reduced in the DM1, DM1 + VA, DM1 + OG + VA and DM1 + insulin groups when compared to the normal control group. The sulfhemoglobin concentration was significantly increased in the diabetic control and the diabetic treated groups when compared to the normal control. DM1 + OG reduced the sulfhemoglobin concentration when compared to DM1. The blood glucose concentration of all the diabetic groups was significantly raised compared to normal control. OG, VA and insulin significantly reduced the blood glucose concentration with the efficacy of OG and VA higher than insulin.
3:::Fraction F5.3 (25 mg/kg) and EASF (20 mg/kg) showed significant anxiolytic and antidepressant activity, respectively. Thin-layer chromatography and phytochemical screening demonstrated the absence of mahanimbine in M. paniculata leaves. Coumarins were observed to be responsible for the anxiolytic activity.
3:::About one-fourth of survey respondents have visited their home country for medical care since their migration to the US. Of those with relatives in Korea, 29% have experienced at least one medical tour, compared to only 9.2% of those without relatives in Korea. Having frequent contacts with relatives in the home country was positively associated with the number of medical tour visits.
3:::Stepwise regression analysis revealed that interpersonal relations, physical activity, and psychological distress accounted for 21% of the variance in life satisfaction (SWLS). Interpersonal relations, nutrition, stress management, spiritual growth and psychological distress accounted for 53% of the variance in psychological well-being (PWB).
3:::In adjusted models, food insecure non-Hispanic white women and non-Hispanic black women had 53% and over 200% higher odds of being pre-diabetic, respectively. Food insecurity was not related to pre-diabetes for Hispanic women or men.
3:::Participants (N = 67) were sedentary 62% of the day, engaging in 73.3 total bouts of daily sedentary behavior, and each bout lasted, on average, 7.8 minutes. All participants engaged in >1 daily bout of sedentary behavior > 10 and > 30 minutes. Sedentary time was slightly greater during the evening and on weekdays. Participants averaged 72.9 daily breaks from sedentary behavior, with each break lasting approximately 4.4 minutes.
3:::Serial assessments resulted in more than 2100 pupillometer readings from 76 subjects. Mean age of the study sample was 55.4 years, with a mean Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8.9. The mean pupillometer values for the enrolled subjects included left constriction velocity of 1.22, left neurological pupil index of 4.21, left pupil size of 2.69, right constriction velocity of 1.18, right neurological pupil index of 4.18, and right pupil size of 2.57. The mean ICP of the study sample was 12, with mean cerebral perfusion pressure of 77. Pupillometer values significantly correlated with ICP values in bivariate (P < .001, r = 0.13-0.23) and multivariate regression models (F(6) = 17.63, P < .001).
3:::A higher level of non-disclosure was associated with more depressive symptoms. This relationship was mediated by self-blame and moderated by benefit-finding. Specifically, non-disclosure was associated with depressive symptoms through self-blame. The impact of non-disclosure was minimized among the women with a higher level of benefit-finding.
3:::Of the 20 patients, there were 13 patients with the Grillo suture, 4 with the Aspen collar and 3 patients with the Johnson CTO. There were 13 tracheal resection procedures and 7 cricotracheal resections, all of which had anastomosis under tension. One major anastomosis dehiscence was noted with the Grillo suture technique which required reoperation. Two patients with the Grillo suture experienced skin breakdown at the suture site. The Aspen cervical collar, which fixed the cervical spine and prevented lateral and rotational motion, was limited in several cases in that it placed the spine in slight hyperextension. The Johnson CTO provided the most support in a flexed position and prevented cervical spine motion in all directions. No anastomosis complications were noted with the Aspen collar or the Johnson CTO, however, several patients sustained minor cutaneous wounds.
3:::Mean (SD) age of the subjects was 46 (10) years; 68% were male. Mean (95% confidence interval) IOP measured 13.1 (13.0-13.1) mm Hg in subjects with normal glucose levels, 13.7 (13.6-13.8) mm Hg in subjects with IFG, and 14.3 (14.1-14.4) mm Hg in subjects with diabetes. The difference in IOP between subjects with normal and abnormal (DM or IFG) serum glucose levels were significant, even after adjusting for age, body mass index, and hypertension (P<0.0001). There was a positive linear correlation between serum glucose levels and IOP in both men (r=0.12; P<0.0001) and women (r=0.17; P<0.0001). For every 10 mg/dL increase in fasting serum glucose, IOP increased by 0.09 mm Hg in men and by 0.11 mm Hg in women.
3:::At a mean follow-up of 20 months (6 to 52), a total of 15 lateral hinge fractures (18.3%) were identified. A sufficient osteotomy, in which both anterior and posterior tibial cortices were involved with extension into the lateral aspect of the plateau in relation to an anteroposterior line tangential to the medial edge of the fibular head in the CT axial plane, was seen in 48 knees (71.6%) in those without a lateral hinge fracture and in seven (46.7%) in those with a lateral hinge fracture. An osteotomy which ended above the level of the fibular head was seen in nine (13.4%) of the knees without a lateral hinge fracture and seven (46.7%) of the those with a lateral hinge fracture. There was a significant relationship between the absence of a lateral hinge fracture and both a sufficient osteotomy and one whose endpoint was at the level of the fibular head (p = 0.0451 and p = 0.0214, respectively).
3:::Random-effects meta-analysis indicated a decrease in circulatory (SMD=-0.44), erythrocellular (SMD=-0.52) and CSF (SMD=-0.14) selenium levels in AD patients compared to controls. Stratified meta-analysis demonstrated that the selenium levels were decreased in both the subgroups with (SMD=-0.55) and without (SMD=-0.37) age matching between AD and controls. Our results also demonstrated a direct association between decreased selenium levels and GPx in AD.
3:::Cases diagnosed with atypical autism were statistically significantly more likely to have received greater overall and dose-dependent exposures to Hg from TM-HepB vaccines administered within the first month of life, first two months of life, and first six months of life than the controls. Similar phenomena were observed when cases and controls were separated by gender.
3:::Single-cell WGA products exhibited a significant sample-to-sample variability in amplified DNA quality as assessed by our 8-gene QC assay. Single-cell WGA products that passed the pre-analysis QC had lower amplification bias and improved aCGH/NGS performance metrics when compared to single-cell WGA products that failed the QC. Increasing the number of cellular input resulted in improved QC-scores overall, but a resultant WGA product that consistently passed the QC step required a starting cellular input of at least 20-cells. Our modified-WGA protocol effectively reduced this number, achieving reproducible high-quality WGA products from ≥5-cells as a starting template. A starting cellular input of 5 to 10-cells amplified using the modified-WGA achieved aCGH and NGS results that closely matched that of unamplified, batch genomic DNA.
3:::Facilitating factors in the delivery of the intervention included intervention related factors such as: the content of the intervention, ongoing training and supervision, using a counselling manual, conducting counselling sessions in the local language (isiXhosa) and fidelity to the manual; counsellor factors included counsellors confidence and motivation to conduct the sessions; participant factors included older age, commitment and a desire to be helped. Barriers included contextual factors such as poverty, crime and lack of space to conduct counselling sessions and participant factors such as the nature of the participant's problem, young age, and avoidance of contact with counsellors. Fidelity ratings and dropout rates varied substantially between counsellors.'
3:::16 out of 33 patients were switched to a generic LEV product. No switchbacks were seen. LEV dose, LEV serum concentrations, fluctuation index and concentration/dose-ratio (C/D-ratio) were not significantly different within-group (baseline vs. study period) or between-group. Large within-subject variability in serum concentrations was seen in both groups. None of the patients that were seizure-free before inclusion experienced seizures while on the generic LEV product.
3:::Overall, 2704 participants were included in the analysis, 18% of them being current smokers and 30.8% former smokers. Current smokers compared to non-smokers had higher total cholesterol (220.6 ± 50.4 versus 213.9 ± 86.8 mg/dl, P = 0.017), LDL-cholesterol (137.8 ± 45.2 versus 130.7 ± 83.7 mg/dl, P = 0.004) and glomerular filtration rate (96.9 ± 16.8 versus 90.7 ± 19.1 ml/min/1.73 m(2), P <0.001) in women and higher triglycerides (170.7 ± 129.8 versus 144.3 ± 94.2 mg/dl, P = 0.007), glomerular filtration rate (97.6 ± 17 versus 90.3 ± 18 ml/min/1.73 m(2), P < 0.001) and lower HDL-cholesterol (48 ± 15.5 versus 50.4 ± 14.1 mg/dl, P = 0.002) in men. Active smoking was associated with hypercholesterolaemia [OR: 1.40 (95% CI: 1.01-1.96), P = 0.04] and low HDL-cholesterolaemia [OR: 1.39 (95% CI: 1.01-1.91), P = 0.04] and negatively associated with overweight/obesity [OR: 0.67 (95% CI: 0.48-0.94), P = 0.02]. Male former smokers had higher prevalence of abdominal obesity (82.4% versus 76.4%, P = 0.02), hypertriglyceridaemia (43.6% versus 35.6%, P = 0.01), hypertension (64% versus 56.4%, P = 0.01) and ischaemic vascular disease (40.5% versus 30.9%, P = 0.003) than male non-smokers.
3:::In the WC group, 84% (n = 221) had resolution of symptoms after the first PRM, versus 82.8% (n = 299) in the NC group. After the second PRM 11% (n = 29) resolved, versus 13.6% (n = 49) in the NC group. After the third PRM 4.9% (n = 13) resolved, versus 3.6% (n = 13) in the NC group. Both clinically and statistically there was no significant difference in outcome between groups.
3:::Demographic characteristics, health literacy and self-management efficacy have all significant effects on HRQL. Age, education level, self-management efficacy and health literacy were significantly related to the HRQL. The constructed model had a good fit for the data according to the model fit indices. Based on the model, health literacy (r = 0.604, p = 0.029) and Self-management efficacy (r = 0.714, p = 0.018) have a significant impact on HRQL. Demographic characteristics were inversely related to HRQL (r = -0.419, p = 0.007), but have a significant impact on health literacy (r = 0.675, p = 0.029) and self-management efficacy (r = 0.379, p = 0.029). At the same time, self-management efficacy was positively correlated to health literacy (r = 0.413, p < 0.01).
3:::Had the gatekeeping pilot programme worked as intended, it would incentivize both providers and patients to increase service utilization at primary care level, as well as establish and enhance two reinforcing feedback loops to shift balance towards primary care. However, a performance-based salary policy undermined the motivation for clinical primary care. Furthermore, the primary care providers suffered from three reinforcing feedback loops (related to primary care capacity, human resource sustainability, patients faith) that trapped primary care development in vicious cycles. At the interface between hospitals and primary care providers, there were also feedback loops exacerbating the existing hospital dominance. These feedback loops were intensified by the unintended consequences of concurrent policies (restrictions on technologies and medicines) and delayed reform in hospitals. Furthermore, the gatekeeping policy itself faced resistance to further development, due to the prevailing ineffective and ritualistic nature of gatekeeping, which formed a balancing loop.'
3:::Five devices met all four electroacoustic tolerances presented in this study, two devices met three tolerances, one device met two tolerances, one device met one tolerance, and one device did not meet any tolerances. Nine devices were able to approximate five of nine National Acoustics Laboratories (NAL) targets within 10 dB while only three devices were able to approximate five of nine NAL targets within a more stringent 5 dB.
3:::The rate of CRSWD in BD subjects was significantly higher than that in MDD subjects (33.7% vs 9.6%; P < 0.001). A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that comorbid CRSWD (OR = 3.35, 95% CI = 1.24 - 9.07; P = 0.018), two or more previous mood episodes within the past year (OR = 3.57, 95% CI = 1.10 - 11.63; P = 0.035), and antidepressant-related switch to mania/hypomania (OR = 10.01, 95% CI = 1.20 - 83.52; P = 0.033) were significantly associated with BD in patients with remitted mood disorders.
3:::Postoperative prevalence of any surgical pain, pain severity, and pain medication was not different between retropubic and transobturator slings. Retropubic sling was associated with greater prevalence of suprapubic pain at 2 weeks (proportion difference 10.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.6-16.4%; P<.001). Transobturator sling was associated with greater prevalence of groin pain at 2 weeks (proportion difference 12.0%; 95% CI 7.1-16.8%; P<.001). There was no difference in pain resolution (odds ratio [OR] 1.11, 95% CI 0.88-1.40; P=.38). Between types of transobturator slings, the odds of surgical pain were similar at 2 (OR 2.39, 95% CI 0.51-11.31; P=.27) and 6 weeks (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.02-9.20; P=.61).
3:::From May 2013 to May 2016, of the 293 women with GDM who were randomized, 149 (51%) were tested four times a day and 144 (49%) were tested every other day. Between the two groups, there were no significant differences with regard to need for medical treatment, induction, gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, rate of preeclampsia, or shoulder dystocia. Birth weight was similar between both groups and the upper bound of the 90% confidence interval (CI) was less than 165 g, establishing noninferiority with a mean difference of -41 g (90% CI -137 to 54 g). Rate of compliance with blood glucose testing was higher in the every-other-day group (89% compared with 92%, P<.01). The differences in rates of macrosomia and birth weight greater than the 95th percentile were not clinically significant. Neonatal outcomes including neonatal hypoglycemia were similar.
3:::Of 251 eligible patients, 246 (98%) agreed to participate. Complete follow-up data were available for 179 (71% of eligible). Most women (83%) used opioids after discharge for a median of 8 days (interquartile range 6-13 days). Of women who filled their prescriptions (165 [92%]), 75% had unused tablets (median per person 75 morphine milligram equivalents, interquartile range 0-187, maximum 630) and the majority (63%) stored tablets in an unlocked location. This amounts to an equivalent of 2,540 unused 5-mg oxycodone tablets over our study period. Women who used all prescribed opioids (n=40 [22%]) were more likely to report that they received too few tablets than women who used some (n=109 [61%]) or none (n=30 [17%]) of the prescribed opioids (33% compared with 4% compared with 5%, P<.001). The top quartile was more likely to be smokers than average users and consumed more opioid morphine milligram equivalents per hour of inpatient stay than average opioid users (1.6, interquartile range 1.1-2.3 compared with 1.0, interquartile range 0.5-1.4, P<.001).
3:::We found that while the work of ASHAs led to some positive health changes in the community, thus providing them with a sense of self-worth and motivation, community norms and beliefs as well as health system attitudes and practices limited their capacity as community health workers.
3:::There were 64,612 ambulatory hysterectomies reported; 81.5% of surgeries were performed laparoscopically and 16% vaginally. If these numbers are extrapolated to national estimates, this represents 100,000-200,000 outpatient hysterectomies per year. The strongest driver of the laparoscopic, compared with vaginal, route of hysterectomy in this data set was presence of cancer (odds ratio 4.01 [3.19-5.05], P<.001). In addition to indication for surgery, patient characteristics such as age, race, income, location, and primary payer were associated with mode of hysterectomy. The laparoscopic surgeries were associated with shorter length of stay (mean stay 0.65 days, [99% confidence interval 0.65-0.66] compared with 0.79 days [0.78-0.81], adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.89 [0.86-0.92], P<.001) and higher mean charges ($24,227 [$24,053-24,402] versus $14,068 [$13,811-14,330], P<.001) compared with vaginal surgeries.
3:::During the study period 1,176 episiotomies were performed in 16,441 vaginal deliveries (7.2%). In phase 2 (2,352 vaginal deliveries), there was a nonsignificant drop in the episiotomy rate with education alone (9.0-8.2%, P=.21). In phase 3 (4,379 vaginal deliveries), the episiotomy rate demonstrated an additional, significant drop to 5.9% (P<.001), but this reduction did not reach the new Leapfrog goal of 5%. In phase 4 (3,160 vaginal deliveries), the hospital episiotomy rate again dropped significantly from 5.9% to 4.37% (P=.007) and met the target rate of 5%. This reduction was sustained over a 12-month time period. During this same time period, the rate of operative vaginal delivery among vaginal births increased (4.5-5.4%, P=.003) and there was no significant change in the rates of third- and fourth-degree perineal laceration (3.8-3.3%, P=.19).
3:::Two thousand six hundred forty (0.5%) had Parkinsons disease, of whom only 7.4% had no other conditions compared with 22.9% of controls (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.43, 95% 0.38-0.49). The Parkinson's group had more conditions, with the biggest difference found for seven or more conditions (PD 12.1% vs. controls 3.9%; aOR 2.08 95% CI 1.84-2.35). 12 of the 31 physical conditions and five of the seven mental health conditions were significantly more prevalent in the PD group. 44.5% with Parkinson's disease were on five to nine repeat prescriptions compared to 24.5% of controls (aOR 1.40; 95% CI 1.28 to 1.53) and 19.2% on ten or more compared to 6.2% of controls (aOR 1.90; 95% CI 1.68 to 2.15).'
3:::Type-I included 53 patients with unilateral dislocation, in which 25 (category A) had no pelvic obliquity or spinal deformity, 19 (category B) had pelvic obliquity with a compensated spinal curvature and nine (category C) had pelvic obliquity and decompensated spinal degenerative changes. Type-II included 25 patients with one dislocated and one dysplastic hip, in which there were eight of category A, 15 of category B and two of category C. Pre-operatively, there were significant differences between the anatomical and functional LLD in type-IB (p = 0.005) and -IC (p < 0.001), but not in type-IA, -IIA or -IIB. Post-operatively, bony LLD increased significantly in types-IB, -IC and -IIB, whereas functional LLD decreased significantly in each type except for IIA. The mean functional LLD decreased from 30.7 mm (standard deviation (sd) 18.5) pre-operatively to 6.2 mm (sd 4.4) post-operatively and the mean anatomical LLD improved from 35.8 mm (sd 19.7) pre-operatively to 12.4 mm (sd 8.3) post-operatively.
3:::This study demonstrated an association between glucose metabolism parameters and triglycerides with OSAS severity underlying the complexity of the process leading to cardiovascular/metabolic complications in this disorder. Moreover, homocysteine, glycemic and lipidic profiles changed significantly after 6 months of PAP therapy in OSAS, supporting its cardiovascular and metabolic protective effect.
3:::There were 172 AYA (Youth Centre = 109, VCT = 63) during 6 baseline weeks and 702 (Youth Centre = 454, VCT = 248) during 24 intervention weeks. CQI was associated with an immediate increase in the proportion of AYA with accurate knowledge of HIV transmission at Youth Centre: 18 vs. 63% [adjusted risk difference (aRD) 0.42,95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.63], and a trend at VCT: 38 vs. 72% (aRD 0.30, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.63). CQI was associated with an increase in the proportion of AYA with accurate HIV prevention knowledge in VCT: 46 vs. 61% (aRD 0.39, 95% CI 0.02-0.76), but not Youth Centre (P = 0.759). In VCT, CQI showed a trend towards increased intent to retest (4.0 vs. 4.3; aRD 0.78, 95% CI -0.11 to 1.67), but not at Youth Centre (P = 0.19). CQI was not associated with changes in AYA satisfaction, which was high during baseline and intervention at both clinics (P = 0.384, P = 0.755). HCW satisfaction remained high during intervention and baseline (P = 0.746).
3:::In the propensity score-matched analysis, the incidence of pneumonia and/or ARDS among patients who had an anatomic lung resection was 9/172 (5.2%) in the non-PLV compared to the PLV group 7/172 (4.1%; odds ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-3.45, P= .62). The incidence of pneumonia and/or ARDS in patients who underwent nonanatomic resection was 3/118 (2.5%) in the non-PLV compared to the PLV group, 1/118 (0.9%; odds ratio, 3.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-28.84, P= .34).
3:::A total of 264 patients were recruited and data from 230 (88%) were available for the primary analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome measure of a visual analogue score for pain on the first post-operative day, prior to physiotherapy, was similar in both groups. The mean difference was -0.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) -5.9 to 4.5; p = 0.834). The periarticular group used less morphine in the first post-operative day compared with the femoral nerve block group (74%, 95% CI 55 to 99). The femoral nerve block group reported 39 adverse events, of which 27 were serious, in 31 patients and the periarticular group reported 51 adverse events, of which 38 were serious, in 42 patients up to six weeks post-operatively. None of the adverse events were directly attributed to either of the interventions under investigation.
3:::(i) The expression of Drebrin is decreased in the hippocampus of aged AD mice compared with that of age-matched WT and young adult AD mice; (ii) cognitive ability of APP/PS1 mice decreases with age; (iii) Drebrin protein expression in the hippocampus correlates with behavioral performance in different aged AD mice; (iv) cognitive ability improved significantly in APP/PS1-Dbn1 mice; (v) the expression level of Drebrin in APP/PS1-Dbn1 mouse hippocampus was significantly increased; (vi) the pathological lesion of AD was alleviated in APP/PS1-Dbn1 mice; (vii) the filamentous actin (F-actin) and microtubule-associated protein 2(MAP-2) in APP/PS1-Dbn1 mice were notably more than control mice.
3:::Sixteen patients received 5 years of pasireotide treatment. Among these, median (95% confidence interval) percentage change from baseline in mean urinary free cortisol was -82.6% (-89.0, -41.9) and -81.8% (-89.8, -67.4) at months 12 and 60. Eleven patients had mean urinary free cortisol ≤ upper limit of normal at month 60. Improvements in clinical signs were sustained during long-term treatment. The safety profile of pasireotide at 5 years was similar to that reported after 12 months. Fifteen of 16 patients experienced a hyperglycaemia-related adverse event; glycated haemoglobin levels were stable between months 6 and 60. Adverse events related to hyperglycaemia, bradycardia, gallbladder/biliary tract, and liver safety were most likely to first occur by month 6; adverse event severity did not tend to worsen over time.
3:::With the metaphysis included, mimicking osteoarthritis, the errors of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were 2.9° (± 2.3°), 4.0° (± 3.3°), 1.0 mm (± 0.8 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.6 mm), 0.7 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 1.0 mm (± 0.7 mm), respectively. With the metaphysis excluded, mimicking a fracture of the surgical neck, the errors of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were 3.8° (± 2.9°), 3.9° (± 3.4°), 2.4 mm (± 1.9 mm), 1.3 mm (± 0.9 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 0.9 mm (± 0.6 mm), respectively.
3:::Multicolor flow cytometry revealed distinct leukocyte populations and immunological features of patients with X-SCID, XLA, X-HIGM, AT, WAS, HIES, and CMCD.
3:::A total of 30 patients with LAPC were enrolled. The median survival and progression-free survival were 21.3 and 12.7 months, respectively. Overall survival rates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 73.3, 36.7, 23.3, and 16.7%, respectively. The median survival of 23 patients who received CRT was 22.9 months, with a 3-year survival rate of 30.4%. The two most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events during induction GS were neutropenia (63.3%) and biliary tract infection (20%). Toxicities during CRT or maintenance chemotherapy were generally mild.
3:::Two shoulders (two patients) were revised and in two shoulders of two different patients, revision surgery was recommended. The mean CS increased from 23.3 (10 to 45) pre-operatively to 56.5 (26 to 81; p < 0.0001), but with a decrease in CS from 62.8 (38 to 93) to 56.5 (26 to 81) between medium- and long-term follow-up (p = 0.01). Without revision surgery, 18 patients (95%) rated their result as good or very good. The mean radiolucent line score for the glenoid components increased from 1.8 (0 to 6) to 8.2 (2 to 18) between medium- and long-term follow-up (p < 0.001).
3:::A total of 127 fractures were identified in 122 patients. The mean age was 72.8 years (16 to 101) and 92 of the patients (75%) were female. A consultant performed the operation in 85 of the cases, (67%) with the remainder performed under direct consultant supervision. In total 107 patients (84%) were allowed to bear full weight immediately. The rate of clinical and radiological union was 81/85 (95%) and only four fractures of 127 (3%) fractures required re-operation for failure of surgery. The 30-day, three- and 12-month mortality rates were 6 (5%), 17 (15%) and 25 (22%), respectively.
3:::Oleandrin significantly decreased cell viabilities in SW480, HCT116 and RKO cells. The IC50 for SW480 cells was 0.02 µM, whereas for NCM460 cells 0.56 µM. More interestingly, the results of flow cytometry showed that oleandrin potently induced apoptosis in SW480 and RKO cells. Oleandrin downregulated protein expression of pro-caspase-3, -9, but enhanced caspase-3, -9 activities. These effects were accompanied by upregulation of protein expression of cytochrome C and BAX, and downregulation of BCL-2 protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, oleandrin increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, but decreased GSH concentration in the cells.
3:::A total of 19 patients were randomised to non-operative (n = 8) or operative (n = 11; tension-band wiring (n = 9), plate (n = 2)) management. The trial was stopped prematurely as the rate of complications (nine out of 11, 81.8%) in the operative group was considered to be unacceptable. There was, however, no difference in the mean DASH scores between the groups at all times. The mean score was 23 (0 to 59.6) in the non-operative group and 22 (2.5 to 57.8) in the operative group, one year after the injury (p = 0.763). There was no significant difference between groups in the secondary outcome measures of the Broberg and Morrey Score or the Mayo Elbow Score at any time during the one year following injury (all p ≥ 0.05).
3:::We enrolled 365 patients with IS and 32 with TIA. α-galactosidase-A sequencing identified a single carrier of a genetic variant of unknown significance (p.R118C) and no well-recognized pathogenic variants. Mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 3.1. Proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 2 was 70.7% at ≤7 days and 87.4% at 6 months. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at presentation and diabetes mellitus predicted 6-month modified Rankin Scale. Thirteen patients experienced 5 recurrent IS and 9 TIA during follow-up. No patient died. Most patients (98.7%) returned home. Among previous workers, 43% had residual working limitations.
3:::The median EQ-5D-3L score was 0.71 (interquartile range (IQR) 0.44 to 0.79) which is worse than the national average in the United States of 0.85 (p < 0.001). Anxiety (median: 55 (IQR 49 to 61), p = 0.031) and pain (median: 61 (IQR 56 to 68), p < 0.001) were also worse than the national average in the United States (50), while depression was not (median: 52 (IQR 38 to 57), p = 0.513). Patients who underwent a primary resection had better QOL and less anxiety, depression and pain compared with those who underwent resection for recurrent or residual disease. The one- and five-year probabilities were 0.96 and 0.74 for survival, 0.07 and 0.25 for tumour recurrence, and 0.02 and 0.16 for developing distant metastasis. A total of 25 local complications occurred in 20 patients (42%), and there were 50 systemic and other complications in 25 patients (52%) within 90 days.
3:::This study investigated the preclinical, clinical, human and animal model studies on honey and diabetes mellitus and found that honey decreases the fasting serum glucose, increases the sting C-peptide and 2-h postprandial C-peptide. Although, there is a dearth of data and literature also contrary discussed the use of honey in diabetic patients.
3:::Before the diagnosis of ICH, 65.8% patients were not on APT, 29.5% patients were on SAPT, and 4.8% patients were on CAPT. There was an overall modest increased in-hospital mortality in the APT group versus no APT group (24% versus 23%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.10). Although patients on SAPT and CAPT were older and had higher risk profiles in terms of comorbidities, there was no significant difference in the in-hospital mortality among patients on SAPT versus those not on any APT (23% versus 23%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.05). However, in-hospital mortality was higher among those on CAPT versus those not on APT (30% versus 23%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-1.63).
3:::There was strong concordance across methods and countries based on the three triangulation parameters: product, provider and service characteristics. HIVST was highly accepted by young people, if provided at no or very low cost. Young people expressed mixed views on oral-fluid tests, weighing perceived benefits with accuracy concerns. There was an expressed lack of trust in health providers and preference for lay community distributors. HIVST addressed youth-specific barriers to standard HIV testing, with home-based distribution considered convenient. Issues of autonomy, control, respect and confidentiality emerged as key qualitative themes.
3:::Among 15 456 enumerated adolescents, 11 175 (72.3%) accepted the intervention. HCT uptake was 80.6% (8707/10 809) and was similar by sex. Adolescents that knew their HIV-positive status increased almost three-fold, from 75 to 210. Following visits from community HIV care providers, knowledge of HIV status increased from 27.6% (3007/10 884) to 88.5% (9636/10 884). HCT uptake was associated with community, age, duration since previous HIV test; other household members accepting HCT, having an HIV-positive household member, circumcision, and being symptomatic for STIs.
3:::Higher vegetable nitrate intake was associated with a lower maximum CCA-IMT (B=-0.015, P=0.002) and lower mean CCA-IMT (B=-0.012, P=0.006). This relationship remained significant after adjustment for lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors (P≤0.01). Vegetable nitrate intake was not a predictor of plaque severity. In total 186 (15%) women experienced an ischemic cerebrovascular disease event. For every 1 SD (29 mg/d) higher intake of vegetable nitrate, there was an associated 17% lower risk of 14.5-year ischemic cerebrovascular disease events in both unadjusted and fully adjusted models (P=0.02).
3:::At physiological insulin concentrations, the IR, not the IGF-1 receptor, facilitated BEC insulin uptake, which required lipid raft-mediated endocytosis, but did not require insulin action on phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). Feeding rats an HFD for 4 weeks decreased iBEC insulin uptake and increased NF-κB binding activity without affecting insulin PI3K signalling, IR expression or content, or insulin degrading enzyme expression. Using an in vitro BBB (co-culture of iBECs and astrocytes), we found insulin was not degraded during transcytosis, and that stimulating astrocytes with L-glutamate increased transcytosis, while inhibiting nitric oxide synthase decreased insulin transcytosis.
3:::No significant difference were observed between the pre and post-treatment click response, 1 kHz and 8 kHz response threshold levels after isotonic sodium chloride administration. All threshold levels were elevated in the positive control group. In the low and high dose diclofenac sodium groups, click response, 1 kHz and 8 kHz response threshold levels were significantly higher compared to the baseline values. Pre and post-treatment mean threshold level changes were not significantly different between the low and high dose diclofenac sodium groups. Pre and post-treatment mean threshold level changes in the gentamicin group were not significantly different from low or high dose diclofenac sodium groups.
3:::To determine the utility of Dexterity, we performed a study to evaluate the effects of task difficulty on the degree of impairment after injury. Dexterity analyzed two months of data and allowed new users to annotate the experiment, visualize results, and save and export data easily.
3:::Apremilast did not inhibit the proliferation of HKe3-wtPDE4B2 cells or HKe3-mtKRAS in two-dimensional cultures, whereas the number of apoptotic HKe3-wtPDE4B2 cells and HKe3-mtKRAS cells increased after apremilast treatment in 3DC, leading to formation of a luminal cavity. Tumour growth in nude mice was dramatically reduced by intraperitoneal injection of apremilast. Notably, a decreased level of caspase-1 expression was observed in HKe3-wtPDE4B2 and HKe3-mtKRAS cells.
3:::The incidence of overall EA was 8.8% with 4.8% for psychological, 2.9% for financial, 0.5% for physical, 0.1% for sexual abuse, and 1.1% for caregiver neglect. Age, gender, duration of residence, language preference and health status change were associated with incident EA. Self-perceived worsened health was positively associated with overall EA (odds ratio [OR] 1.28 (1.01, 1.62). Women (OR 2.98 [1.10, 8.11]) and older individuals (OR 1.06 [1.00, 1.13]) had an increased risk of caregiver neglect. Older adults who have lived in the U.S. longer had a higher risk of financial exploitation (OR 1.02 [1.00, 1.05]). Individuals who prefer to speak Mandarin or English were more likely to experience EA (OR 2.08 [1.21, 3.58]) and sexual or physical abuse (OR 3.91 [1.01, 15.17]). No significant association was observed between education, income, marital status, number of children, country of origin, overall health, life quality, and incident EA.
3:::Forty-seven women participated in focus groups, the majority (66.0%) were age 66 and over and half (50.1%) had less than a high school education. Participants expressed predominantly positive attitudes toward biospecimen research, but also identified multifaceted barriers to participation that included cultural beliefs of the body, perceived physical and privacy risks, as well as perceptions related to aging. Use of minimally invasive biospecimen collection and education to promote awareness of biospecimen research were suggested facilitators to increasing biospecimen research participation.
3:::TX-1123 exhibited COX1-inhibitory activity [half-maximal-inhibitory concentration (IC50)=1.57×10(-5) M]. The COX2 inhibitory activity of TX-1123 was potent (IC50=1.16×10(-6) M), and the ratio of COX1/COX2 inhibition was 13.5. TX-1123 bound to the COX2 molecule, and the oxygen atom of the 4-cyclopentene-1,3-dione region of TX-1123 interacted with Cys(26) and Gln(447) of COX2.
3:::MDSCs and relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines increased in the peripheral blood of tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, the frequency of MDSCs rapidly increased in mice with tumor recurrence.
3:::The mean age of study participants was 76.3 years (SD ± 8.4) and 58.0% were female. After adjusting for potential covariates, higher scores of activities of daily living (odds ratio [OR] = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.73-0.98), instrumental activities of daily living (OR = 0.87, 0.82-0.92), and Rosow-Breslau reversely coded (OR = 0.85, 0.75-0.96) were associated with lower risk of EM. Also, lower scores of observed PF performance measurements, including tandem stand (OR = 0.78, 0.70-0.88), measured walk (OR = 0.84, 0.77-0.91), and the overall measurement (OR = 0.93, 0.89-0.97) have significant associations with lower risk of EM.
3:::Higher maximum serum concentration (Cmax) values resulted from i.v. administration, whereas longer time to maximum serum (Tmax) values resulted from i.p. administration. In the peritoneal dissemination model, i.p. administration inhibited tumour growth and increased survival rate, whereas in the subcutaneous model, i.v. administration significantly inhibited tumour growth compared to i.p. administration.
3:::Every one point higher in TIP is associated with being 2% less likely to have any depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR] 0.98, 0.97-0.99) in cross-sectional analysis. Longitudinally, every one-point increase in TIP score was associated with a 2% lower risk of depressive symptoms at Wave 2 (OR 0.98, 0.97-0.99). Improved TIP over 2 years was associated with 25% decreased risk of having any depressive symptoms at Wave 2 (OR 0.75, 0.63-0.89). Additionally, highest tertile of TIP change was associated with a 31% decreased risk of any depressive symptoms compared to lowest tertile (OR 0.68, 0.55-0.84).
3:::Social support was significantly associated with global cognitive function (β = .11, SE = .02, p < .001), episodic memory (β = .11, SE = .03, p < .001), working memory (β = .18, SE = .08, p < .05), and executive function (β = 1.44, SE = .37, p < .001). Social strain was significantly associated with global cognitive function (β = .23, SE = .05, p < .001), episodic memory (β = .27, SE = .07, p < .001), working memory (β = .34, SE = .17, p < .05), and executive function (β = 2.75, SE = .85, p < .01). In terms of sources of social support/strain, higher support from friends was significantly associated with higher global cognitive function (β = .04, SE = .02, p < .05), higher episodic memory (β = .05, SE = .02, p < .05), and higher executive function (β = .71, SE = .29, p < .05). Higher strain from spouse was significantly associated with higher global cognitive function (β = .10, SE = .03, p < .01), higher episodic memory (β = .11, SE = .04, p < .01), and higher executive function (β = 1.28, SE = .49, p < .01). Higher strain from friends was significantly associated with higher executive function (β = 3.59, SE = 1.17, p < .01).
3:::Perceived stress was positively related to depressive symptoms among U.S. Chinese older adults. No moderation effects were found for Neuroticism. Conscientiousness significantly moderated the perceived stress-depressive symptom relationship. The positive relationship between perceived stress and depressive symptoms was weaker for people who were higher in Conscientiousness than those who were lower in Conscientiousness.
3:::Expression of GalNAc-T6 was found to be significantly related to expression of E-cadherin. Positive expression of GalNAc-T6 was significantly associated with better histological grade and good clinical prognosis of patients, but positive E-cadherin and β-catenin expression were not significantly associated with improved overall survival.
3:::The results showed that older adults with higher education (odds ratio [OR] = 1.03, confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-1.06; OR = 1.09, CI = 1.06-1.11, respectively), lower perception of children being filial (OR = 0.95, CI = 0.93-0.97; OR = 0.96, CI = 0.94-0.98], respectively), and lower sense of mastery (OR = 0.95, CI = 0.94-0.96; OR = 0.98, CI = 0.97-0.99, respectively) were more likely to report both family and marital conflict. Older adults who had more friends were less likely to report marital conflict (OR = 0.61, CI = 0.43-0.86).
3:::The phagocytic activity of latex beads was dependent on the concentration of beads and incubation time. LPSp, at as low as 100 pg/ml, significantly increased phagocytosis against the beads. In the experiment of Aβ1-42 phagocytosis, LPSp significantly increased Aβ phagocytic activity.
3:::The median age at first relapse was 20 months. The probability of relapse remained approximately 30% at age 2 years and increased to 45% by 4 years and 52% by 6 years. Parent-reported adherence with bracing reduced the odds of a relapse by 15 times (P < 0.01). After an initial relapse, adherence with bracing was successful in avoiding a subsequent relapse in 68% of patients. Feet graded as very severe on the Diméglio scale were 5.75 times more likely to relapse than those graded severe and were 7.27 times more likely than those graded as moderate.
3:::Using the standard anterolateral portal, 52 of 70 injections were confirmed to have been placed in the intra-articular space on the first attempt (accuracy rate, 74.2%). Using the modified full-flexion anterolateral portal, 68 of 70 injections were placed in the intra-articular space on the first attempt (accuracy rate, 97.1%; P = 0.000).
3:::Fifty-eight Italian centers/institutions returned the compiled questionnaire; participants practiced at community cancer centers or hospitals (56.9%), academic institutions (36.2%), and other settings (private clinics, etc) (6.9%). There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of practice setting according to geographic areas. Most responders were medical oncologists (84.5%) and were members (82.8%) of at least 1 scientific society or cooperative group. Almost 31.5% of responders reported interruption of the whole treatment, mostly because of toxicity (41.2%), followed by patients choice (29.4%), or achievement of clinical benefit (23.5%). Dose reduction was referred by 47.4% of responders. Reduction of dose for both drugs was referred by 88.5% of responders, and the extent of dose reduction ranged between 10% and 30%.'
3:::A quarter of the sample were current smokers and 42.5% reported a prior history of smoking. Eighteen percent and 22% of older Chinese men met the eligibility criteria for appropriateness for CMS and USPSTF LDCT screening, respectively. Furthermore, education, marital status, and number of children were significantly associated with chronic smoking behavior.
3:::Of the 2,713 participants in waves 1 and 2, their average age was 72.6 years old, 58.4% were female, with 8.7 years of education average, and 85.8% had an annual individual income of less than $10,000. Our findings show subjects of older age, female sex, lower education, lower income, and a greater number of medical comorbidities had lower physical function levels at baseline. Older adults experienced a faster decline in physical function for the overall performance measure (β = -.02, p < .001). Additionally, elderly adults with higher education have a faster decline of physical function in the overall performance measure (β = -.03, p < .01).
3:::After adjusting for covariates, results indicated significant association between higher social support and higher utilization of cancer screenings. Regarding to different sources of social support, higher levels of social supports from family members (odds ratio [OR], 1.15 [1.07, 1.25]) and friends (OR, 1.14 [1.06, 1.23]) were associated with higher utilization of breast cancer screening. However, higher levels of social support from family members (OR, 0.94 [0.88, 0.99]) and friends (OR, 0.94 [0.88, 1.00]) were associated with lower utilization of colon cancer screening. No associations were found between social support and prostate cancer screening.
3:::Radiochemical yield (decay corrected) of 54±7% (n=4) was obtained after optimization for coupling the [(18)F]FBEM to Nanofitin. Pharmacokinetics results of [(18)F]FBEM-Cys-H4 revealed a fast clearance through the liver and the kidneys.
3:::Results showed that self-efficacy for coping with cancer can influence the effect of a Reiki treatment. Higher efficacious patients showed a more powerful effect of the Reiki intervention on both anxiety and mood than the low efficacious patients.
3:::Two patients were excluded since they did not have adequate measurements of CRP and IL6. Among the remaining patients, 25 (52%) were ≥70 years old. Nine (19%), 12 (25%) and 12 (25%) patients had low serum albumin (<3.0 g/dl), elevated CRP (≥70 mg/l) and elevated IL6 (≥24 pg/ml), respectively. Age was a significant predictor of non-home discharge (p=0.01). Low serum albumin (<3.0 g/dl) was a predictor of death within 6 month (p=0.03). Elevated CRP (≥70 mg/l) was a predictor of non-home discharge (p=0.02), death within 6 months (p=0.02), death within 12 months (p=0.04), and longer hospital stay (p=0.01). Elevated IL6 (≥24 pg/ml) was a predictor of non-home discharge (p=0.002) and surgical complications (p=0.02), and also associated with longer hospital stay (p=0.03).
3:::Cross-sectionally, vigorous PA, and leisurely walking PA, were independently associated with lower odds of CRLDS in all but the fifth model and green vegetables in all models. Longitudinally, green vegetables and interactions between the FVI summary score, the PA summary score, and other factors at wave 8 were most consistently associated with CRLDS at wave 10. In both cross-sectional and longitudinal models, the socioeconomic variables showed the strongest association as risk factors for CRLDS.
3:::The 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of 65 pathologically PALN-positive patients who underwent PALN dissection (n=704) were 33.8% and 21.2%, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed the following poor prognostic factors: nodal involvement around the celiac axis (hazard ratio (HR)=4.04, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.55-9.63), tumor diameter of ≥120 mm (HR=3.37; 95% CI=1.18-9.63) and ≥3 PALNs involved (HR=2.24; 95% CI=1.21-4.15). Patients with none of these factors survived significantly longer than those with any of these factors (5-year OS=87.5% versus 9.3%, respectively; p<0.001).
3:::Birth weight was positively associated with BMD-TB and BMC at all sites among girls; standardized β coefficients [95% CI] were 0.11 [0.01, 0.20] for BMD-TB and 0.15 [0.06, 0.24], 0.18 [0.09, 0.28] and 0.29 [0.20, 0.38] for BMC-FN, TH and TB, respectively. In boys, birth weight was positively associated with BMC at all sites with estimates of 0.10 [0.01, 0.19], 0.12 [0.03, 0.21] and 0.15 [0.07, 0.24] for FN, TH and TB, respectively. Corresponding analyses using birth length as exposure gave significantly positive associations with BMC at all sites in both sexes. The significant positive association between birth weight and BMC-TB in girls, and birth length and BMC-TB in boys remained after multivariable adjustment.
3:::Six patients were enrolled. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached at level 1. Oxaliplatin at 130 mg/m(2) combined with capecitabine at 2,000 mg/m(2)/day, b.i.d. had acceptable toxicity. No treatment-related death occurred. Most frequent drug-related adverse events during neoadjuvant G-XELOX were nausea and peripheral sensory neuropathy. One patient declined surgical resection, leaving five undergoing resection with curative intent, of whom four achieved pathological down-staging after neoadjuvant G-XELOX.
3:::Clearance (6.8 L/h) and volume (33 L) estimates were comparable with literature. The only significant covariate was the presence of carboplatin on olaparib clearance, consistent with published noncompartmental PK and in vitro data.
3:::49 patients (71%) were reinvestigated with a follow-up of 32 months (11-58 months). A significant difference was found in the ability of elbow flexion between the affected arm and the opposite side as well as in pronation and supination. In elbow flexion and extension as well as in pronation and supination of the forearm, the strength was significantly diminished.
3:::A total of 32 patients were enrolled in the study. Median duration of abiraterone treatment was 13.0 months (range=3.8-40.9 months). Median duration of abiraterone treatment before RT was 5.9 months (range=0.4-40.0 months), and 7.2 months after RT (range=0.1-29.7 months). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.6 months (95%CI=10.5-14.7) from the initiation of abiraterone treatment. From RT administration, PFS was 9.6 months (95%CI=6.4-12.9). Median overall survival (OS) since abiraterone initiation was 18.9 months (95%CI=4.7-33.0).
3:::Of 60 patients with headache, 17% had complete response, 82% partial response and 2% stable disease (best response). Of 39 patients with seizures, 31% had complete response, 64% partial response and 5% stable disease. Four patients developed recurrent seizures after 1 year. Regarding the size of cavernoma at 15 months, complete response was observed in 6%, partial response in 75%, stable disease in 15%, progression in 1% and pseudo-progression in 3% of patients. Bleeding within 2 years after RGS radiosurgery occurred in only five patients (6%). RGS dose had no significant impact on outcomes.
3:::Thirty-three of 152 patients (22%) exhibited corrected QT ≥450 ms. The different QT correction equations provided similar results, except the Bazett equation. In patients with long QT syndrome, there was a higher proportion of male subjects (58 vs. 33%, p = 0.009) and a higher number of QT-prolonging drugs than in patients without long QT syndrome. Male sex (odds ratio, 3.25) and the number of prescribed QT-prolonging agents (odds ratio, 1.77) were significantly associated with the probability of long QT syndrome. The number of QT-prolonging drugs had a stronger influence on the risk of long QT syndrome in men than in women.
3:::Agreement for primary CRC and mCRC was higher using all types of diagnosis codes instead of the main one exclusively (respectively 95% vs. 53% for primary CRC and 91% vs. 24% for mCRC). Agreement was substantial (κ 0.65) for cardiovascular diseases, notably atrial fibrillation (κ 0.77) and hypertension (κ 0.68). It was moderate for psychiatric disorders (κ 0.49) and respiratory diseases (κ 0.48), although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had a good agreement (κ 0.75). Within the class of endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (κ 0.55), agreement was substantial for diabetes (κ 0.91), obesity (κ 0.82) and hypothyroidism (κ 0.72) and moderate for hypercholesterolemia (κ 0.51) and malnutrition (κ 0.42).
3:::A total of 102 patients were divided in three groups: Surgery with perioperative therapy, n=45; surgery alone, n=19; and dCRT, n=38. Overall, median progression-free survival and median survival time were 9.3 and 26.7 months, respectively. The median survival time was 27.5 months in the group treated with surgery with perioperative treatment, 50.6 months in those treated with surgery alone, and 22 months in the dCRT group. No significant survival difference was seen among the three groups.
3:::With thorough examination and immunohistochemical stainings twenty-nine of 168 SLN biopsies (28 patients, 17% of the patients) showed micrometastases or ITC, and a full ALND was performed at a later time. During these ALNDs 13 to 31 lymph nodes were removed. Additional ALN metastases were found in three (10%) patients. Two (7%) of the 28 patients with triple-negative cancer deceased of metastatic breast cancer. Three patients (11%) reported adverse effects of ALND requiring physiotherapy due to pain, stiffness, swelling or arm oedema. Tumor factors such as molecular subtype (p=0.002), tumor size (p=0.004), and proliferation index (Ki-67) (p=0.003) correlated with higher numbers of ALN metastases.
3:::The structural network was significantly disrupted in global and regional levels in both SVD groups. SVD+D group showed more severe impairment of global network efficiency, and lower nodal efficiency and less connections within multiple regions like hippocampus, amygdala and several cortical structures. The disruption of network connectivity was associated with depressive symptoms and MRI measures of SVD, however, no mediation effect of network efficiency was detected between MRI measures and depressive symptoms.
3:::Low expression of KLF9 was observed in 62.82% of tumors, which was related to poor differentiation (p=0.036) and vascular invasion (p=0.017). Furthermore, the overall survival of patients with low KLF9 expression was significantly shorter than that of those with high KLF9 expression (p=0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed KLF9 as an independent prognostic factor (p=0.000).
3:::The pooled correlation coefficient for all included studies was ρ=-0.59 (95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.72 to -0.45), heterogeneity Tau(2)=0.04 (p<0.0001), I(2)=73%, test for overall effect Z=8.67 (p<0.00001).
3:::The median age of the five patients (two men, three women) was 61.4 (range=56-75) years. The surgical procedure was partial hepatectomy in two, laparoscopic partial hepatectomy in two, and one case of partial hepatectomy with subsegmentectomy. There was no postoperative complication of Clavien-Dindo grade 3A or higher. One patient had multiple lung metastases.
3:::Nine patients had a FIGO stage IB1 (25%), 7 had stage IB2(19%), 3 had stage IIA (8%), and 17 had stage IIB disease (47%). Evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging after NACT showed 32 RECIST responses (89%) (CR in 11, PR in 21). Patients who were inoperable had insufficient reduction of the tumor to be operable (4 patients), progressive disease (1 patient), or stable disease (1 patient). Thirty patients were suitable for surgery after NACT. Pathology showed OPT in 50% (CR in 10, PR1 in 5). Thirteen patients had pathologic lymph nodes on radiological evaluation before start of chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, the lymph nodes were negative in 6 (47%) of these patients (pathologic complete remission). Postoperative chemoradiotherapy was administered in 11 patients (2 because of close resection margins, 5 because of metastatic lymph node after surgery, 2 because of close resection margins and metastatic lymph nodes after surgery, and 1 tumor >4 cm after NACT). Hematologic toxicity was acceptable with no febrile neutropenia and a low nonhematologic toxicity. The estimated 5-year overall survival was 70.8%.
3:::Of 363 patients, 83 (22.9%) were PNI-positive. The 5-year overall survival and disease-specific survival rates were significantly worse for patients with PNI-positive Dukes B or C disease compared to those with PNI-negative disease. There was no significant difference in the recurrence pattern (hematogenous or lymphatic spread), but patients with PNI-positive disease had a significantly higher rate of recurrence compared to those with PNI-negative disease (p<0.001).'
3:::Plaque was elevated in 25.5% to 29.1% of the 165 total Visual Reads. Interrater agreement was strong (kappa = 0.73-0.82) and consistent with reported values. Quantitative Reads were elevated in 45.5% of participants. Final VisQ Reads changed from initial Visual Reads in 16 interpretations (9.7%), with most changing from ""nonelevated"" Visual Reads to ""elevated."" These changed interpretations demonstrated lower plaque quantification than those initially read as ""elevated"" that remained unchanged. Interrater variability improved for VisQ Reads with the addition of quantitative information (kappa = 0.88-0.96).
3:::The accuracy of outcome prediction was 98% with SEPs compared to 90% with EEG. EEG alone always predicted unfavorable outcome when it was inactive (n=9), and favorable outcome when it was normal or only mildly abnormal (n=17). However, newborns with moderate or severe EEG background abnormality could have either favorable or unfavorable outcome, which was correctly predicted by SEP in all but one newborn (accuracy in this subgroup 96%). Absent VEPs were always associated with an inactive EEG, and an unfavorable outcome. However, presence of VEPs did not guarantee a favorable outcome.
3:::At baseline, 31.7% of study members reported effort-reward imbalance at work and 15.9% reported job strain. During a mean follow-up of 9.8 years, 1,078 coronary events were recorded. After adjustment for potential confounders, a hazard ratio of 1.16 (95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.35) was observed for effort-reward imbalance compared with no imbalance. The hazard ratio was 1.16 (1.01-1.34) for having either effort-reward imbalance or job strain and 1.41 (1.12-1.76) for having both these stressors compared to having neither effort-reward imbalance nor job strain.
3:::A significant effect was only detected for sex (F = 5.418, p = 0.020); PSC thickness showed a higher mean value in women (mean difference ± SE: 0.224 ± 0.096 mm). A significant and negative r value was detected for males aged >45 years (-0.173, p = 0.026); in that group of patients, PSC thickness decreased as age increased (0.018 ± 0.008 mm/year). For females aged ≤45 years, a significant and positive r value was found (0.198, p = 0.022); in that group, PSC thickness increased as age increased (0.020 ± 0.008 mm/year).
3:::HRM method was extensively used for molecular typing of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, representing a versatile genetic tool: a) to evaluate genetic diversity and subtype at species/subspecies level, based also on allele discrimination/identification and mutation screening; b) to recognize phylogenetic groupings (lineage, sublineage, subgroups); c) to identify antimicrobial resistance; d) to detect and screen for mutations related to drug-resistance; e) to discriminate gene isoforms. HRM method showed, in almost all instances, excellent typeability and discriminatory power, with high concordance of typing results obtained with gold standards or comparable methods. Conversely, for the evaluation of genetic determinants associated to antibiotic-resistance or for screening of associated mutations in key gene fragments, the sensitivity and specificity was not optimal, because the targeted amplicons did not encompass all the crucial mutations.
3:::One hundred and seventeen cases of AKI-MALA-RRT were observed (12.04/100,000 metformin treated diabetics, 1.45% of all RRT-ICU patients). Survival rate was 78.3%. The average duration of RRT was 4.0 days at mean dialysis effluent of 977 mL/kg/day. At admission most patients were dehydrated, and experienced shock and oliguria.
3:::In terms of results, this study aims to verify the reliability of the Professional Assessment Instrument tool as a system for the classification and measurement of nursing care which includes the entire care process, taking into account all of the variables deemed crucial to the nursing care effort.
3:::A total of 229 (48.6%) GPs participated in the survey. In the 2015/2016 influenza season, the vaccination coverage among the interviewed GPs was 76.4% (n = 175). A patient number ≥ 900 increased the likelihood to have been vaccinated in the 2015/2016 season (OR = 3.3; P < 0.01). Overall only 79.9% prefers to use the adjuvated vaccines on patients > 64 and the 58% of GPs who chose not to get vaccinated considers influenza as a non-risk pathology for a healthy subject.
3:::The mean arc of motion of group A (n = 20) increased from preoperatively 74.3° to 120.5° postoperatively (p < 0.001); group B (n = 22) showed an improvement of 104.6° preoperatively to 123.4° after surgery (p = 0.002). Mean improvement was 46.3° ± 27.5° in group A and 16.4° ± 19.4° in group B. Mean post-operative VAS was 0.9 ± 1.5 in group A and 1.3 ± 2.2 in group B. 92.9% of patients achieved a functional arc of elbow motion >100°. The ESAS indicated good to excellent clinical outcome showing 88.8 ± 10.0 points in group A and 84.1 ± 21.4 points in group B. Thirty-six patients (85.7%) returned to their previous work level after surgery.
3:::A total of 100 surveys were gathered. Unsupervised cluster analysis was used to group individuals with similar dimensions highlighting three general genres of influencers: well-rounded, knowledge and relational.
3:::Little change was observed in over- or underweight perceptions. However, relative to those perceiving their body as about right', those perceiving themselves as overweight reported decreasing confidence (all groups), decreasing happiness (11- and 13-year-old girls), and increasing psychological health symptoms (all girls and 15-year-old boys). Perceived underweight is associated with poor well-being, especially in males, but we present little evidence that this is a recent phenomenon.'
3:::Patients with hypercortisolism showed lower levels of short-/medium-chain acylcarnitines and branched-chain and aromatic amino acids, but higher polyamines levels, in comparison to controls. These alterations were confirmed after excluding diabetic patients. Regression models showed significant correlation between cortisol after dexamethasone suppression test (DST) and 31 metabolites, independently of confounding/contributing factors. Among those, histidine and spermidine were also significantly associated with catabolic signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism. According to an discriminant analysis, the panel of metabolites was able to correctly classify subjects into the main diagnostic categories and to distinguish between subjects with/without altered post-DST cortisol and with/without diabetes in >80% of the cases.
3:::One-fifth of admissions were due to trauma. 58% of admissions were male. Weekends accounted for 49% of admissions. Road traffic injuries (RTI) (66%) and toxin ingestion (TI) (17%) contributed the majority of admissions. Children aged 0-4 years accounted for 45%, 5-9 years 39%, and 10-15 years 16% of admissions. The mortality rate was 9.0% with RTI accounting for 64%. 64% of mortalities occurred in the 0-4 year cohort. Mean age of survivors (5.8 years) was significantly higher than non-survivors (3.4 years) (p < 0.05). 89% of all children required invasive ventilation on PICU admission. Mean length of ventilation in non-survivors (10.2 days) was significantly longer than survivors (4.5 days) (p < 0.05).
3:::From 1650 studies, we included 26 studies comprising 11 961 DTCs for meta-analyses. In DTC patients, we found significant associations of VI with tumor persistence (OR = 2.75; 95% CI = 1.46-5.18), LRR (OR = 4.44; 95% CI = 2.94-6.71), DR (OR = 5.08; 95% CI = 2.95-8.75), overall RP (OR = 3.53; 95% CI = 2.09-5.96) and worse DSS (HR = 2.47; 95% CI = 1.45-4.21). Our results also demonstrated that the presence of extensive VI is associated with a significantly higher risk for DR in follicular thyroid carcinomas as compared with focal VI.
3:::Totally, 671 deaths were observed over an average follow-up of 8 years. When defining the referent group based on 1 clinical assessment, the unhealthy non-obese (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.45) and unhealthy obese (HR = 1.29; CI: 1.05, 1.60) were at greater risk of all-cause mortality compared to the healthy non-obese, yet no excess risk was seen in the healthy obese (HR = 1.14; CI: 0.83, 1.52). When we re-defined the referent group based on 2 clinical assessments, effect estimates were accentuated and healthy obesity was at increased risk of mortality (HR = 2.67; CI: 1.64, 4.34).
3:::At Week 12, the mean improvement in FEV1 with indacaterol 150 μg versus placebo was comparable in the elderly (150 mL), very elderly (160 mL), and young (170 mL) groups (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Similar improvement in FEV1 was observed with indacaterol 300 μg versus placebo in each group (p < 0.001). This improvement was also significantly higher with indacaterol than formoterol, salmeterol, and tiotropium in all groups (p < 0.01). Both TDI and SGRQ scores significantly improved with indacaterol versus placebo across age groups (p < 0.001) and were significantly higher than that for tiotropium (p < 0.001). Incidences of adverse events among indacaterol- or placebo-treated patients were similar, regardless of the age group.
3:::Seven out of 8 patients (87.5%) in Group A had LGI1 and/or CASPR2 antibodies. One Group B patient had LGI1 antibodies but was negative on re-testing with a live cell assay. No Group C patients had monospecific antibodies. Inter-rater reliability was high; combining Groups A and B patients, the kappa statistic was 0.87 and 1.0 for LGI1 and CASPR2 antibodies respectively.
3:::Of the 99 patients identified, 86 were included, 41 with blepharospasm (32 female, mean age 71±11years), 28 with hemifacial spasm (16 female, mean age 65±12years) and 17 with post-paralytic facial syndrome (14 female, mean age 50±17years). The sign was detected in 67.9% of the patients with hemifacial spasm, in 23.5% of the post-paralytic facial syndrome group and in none of the patients with blepharospasm, exhibiting a sensitivity of 51% and a specificity of 100% for the diagnosis of hemifacial spasm/post-paralytic facial syndrome and a specificity of 76% for hemifacial spasm, compared to post-paralytic facial syndrome.
3:::Choledocolithasis was diagnosed by MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic retrograde (ERCP) in 496 of 1,000 patients reviewed. Mean CBD was 6.0 mm (±2.8 mm) in the 504 of 1,000 patients without choledocolithiasis on ERCP/MRCP. Increasing age had no correlation with CBD size as a continuous variable (r2 = 0.011, p = 0.811). No difference occurred across age groups (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.157). Age had no association with diagnostic likelihood of choledocolithiasis (AOR [95% CI] 0.99 [0.98-1.01], adjusted-p = 0.335).
3:::Four core themes were discerned based on the narratives of the focus group interviews: (1) ""timing of collecting feedback at more than one time point""; (2) ""modify the questions being asked in collecting student feedback""; (3) ""are electronic means of collecting feedback good enough?; and (4) ""what will be next for student feedback?"".
3:::In spite the international clinical placement only was four weeks, the findings suggested that real life experience culturally awakened the students and forced an ongoing process developing cultural competence. However, it is important to give students time to reflection.
3:::Aqueous and methanol extracts (300 mg/kg b.w.) decreased blood glucose level in diabetic rats by 24% and 46%, respectively. Administration of aqueous and methanol extracts at 300 mg/kg b.w. significantly (p < 0.01) modulated the antioxidant status of liver in diabetic rats by increasing levels of GR (22.5 ± 1.0, 24.4 ± 1.02 μg GSSG utilized/min/mg of protein), GPx (20.7 ± 1.2, 23.6 ± 2.04 μg GSH utilized/min/mg of protein), SOD (36.1 ± 1.7, 39.05 ± 1.5 units/mg of protein) and CAT (1744.5 ± 132.5, 1956.6 ± 125.2 nmol H2O2 decomposed/min/mg of protein), respectively. Similar results were observed for pancreas.
3:::Patients receiving mechanical ventilation had higher prevalence and intensity of karyomegaly, perinuclear halos, cell keratinization, deep cells, and leukocyte infiltrates than did patients in the other 2 groups (P < .05). No significant differences were observed between the control group and the group who did not receive mechanical ventilation.
3:::Twenty-four eyes were included. Ganglion cell complex and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness did not show statistically significant changes through 12 months (55.6 ± 18.5 and 81.9 ± 9.9 μm at baseline, 52.7 ± 19.3 and 84.6 ± 15.5 μm at month 12, P > 0.05). Central macular thickness showed progressive decrease from baseline to month 12, with maximum reduction at month 3 (P < 0.001). Statistically significant reduction in choroidal thickness was registered in the nasal 500, 1000, and 1,500 μm from the fovea, corresponding to the papillomacular region (from 169.6 ± 45.3 to 153.9 ± 46.9, P < 0.001).
3:::Acceptability of the intervention was high. Receiving additional external professional help like psychotherapy or clinical counselling was identified as a moderator contributing to the efficacy of the intervention. Caregivers burden (Eating Disorder Symptom Impact Scale) and psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-12) were reduced by the intervention but not caregivers' accommodating behaviours (Accommodation and Enabling Scale).'
3:::Patients in the study experienced more physical than mental adverse health outcomes, and the risk for mental problems was 2 or 3 times the rate expected. Adverse physical outcomes were common. One-quarter of patients remained significantly restricted; some had severe neurological impairments of the lower extremities. On cognitive tests, about half scored inconclusive or mildly impaired. Patients were often admitted to the hospital.
3:::The low testosterone group showed statistically significantly higher pain (P = 0.047), unpleasantness (P = 0.047), anxiety (P = 0.015), and fear ratings (P = 0.01) than the high testosterone group. Fear rating increased as pain rating rose and as testosterone level decreased (P < 0.001). When participants received noxious stimulation, the pACC and OFC were more highly activated in the low testosterone group compared to the high testosterone group. Activation of S1, a region related to pain intensity, did not differ between both groups.
3:::Blood and plasma levels of selenium and rubidium were significantly reduced while the levels of chromium, cobalt, and molybdenum were significantly increased in the study group vs. healthy volunteers. There was an uptake of chromium, manganese, and zinc. Molybdenum mass balance was around zero. For selenium, copper, and rubidium there were a marked loss.
3:::Overall, 35 of 48 (73%) eligible patients were enrolled, including 10 requiring mechanical ventilation. Of these patients, 34 (97%) completed the 48-hour actigraphy period; 20 (57%) found the devices comfortable. Wrist devices logged a mean (SD) of 33.4 (8.8) hours of estimated sleep (72% [19%] of recording period) and 19.6 (17.2) movements per 30-second epoch. Ankle devices recorded 43.2 (4.1) hours of estimated sleep (93% [7%] of recording period) and 5.1 (6.0) movements per 30 seconds.
3:::In general, the topographic analysis revealed that the majority of nerves were identified in sectors 4 through 9, corresponding to the posterolateral and posterior surfaces of the prostate gland. At the prostate base, the majority of nerves were found at the posterolateral and posterior surfaces of the gland. Within the mid-region of the prostate, the same topographic distribution pattern was observed, but the nerve fibers were closer to the prostatic capsule. At the apical region, the percentage of nerve fibers identified in the anterior region was higher, despite their major concetration in the posterior surface. The nerves identified at the apex were mainly located up to 2.5 mm from the prostate. This proximity to the prostate was specifically observed in the anterolateral and anterior sectors. In the craniocaudal sense, the percentage of nerves identified between 2.5 and 5 mm from the prostatic capsule remained constant.
3:::Of 163 participating patients, 151 patients (90.9%) completed both surveys (116 curative and 35 palliative patients). Before beginning RT, 88.6% of palliative and 72.3% of curative patients showed at least one clinically relevant symptom. Curative patients most frequently named decreased general wellbeing (38.6%), followed by tiredness (35.0%), anxiety (32.4%), depression (30.0%), pain (26.3%), lack of appetite (23.5%), dyspnea (17.8%), drowsiness (8.0%) and nausea (6.1%). Palliative patients most frequently named decreased general wellbeing (62.8%), followed by pain (62.8%), tiredness (60.0%), lack of appetite (40.0%), anxiety (38.0%), depression (33.3%), dyspnea (28.5%), drowsiness (25.7%) and nausea (14.2%). At the end of RT, the proportion of curative and palliative patients with a clinically relevant symptom had increased significantly to 79.8 and 91.4%, respectively; whereas the proportion of patients reporting clinically relevant pain had decreased significantly (42.8 vs. 62.8%, respectively). Palliative patients had significantly increased tiredness. Curative patients reported significant increases in pain, tiredness, nausea, drowsiness, lack of appetite and restrictions in general wellbeing.
3:::For every unit increase in workload burden, adherence to the ABCDE bundle decreased 53% (odds ratio [OR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28-0.79; P = .004). Bundle difficulty (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.08-1.07), perceived safety (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.10-2.65), confidence (OR, 0.37, 95% CI, 0.10-1.35), and perceived strength of evidence (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.14-3.35) were not associated with ABCDE bundle adherence. For every unit increase in perceived difficulty carrying out the bundle, adherence with early mobility was reduced 59% (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.19-0.90; P = .03). In addition, ABCDE bundle adherence (ie, ventilator bundle) was less than DE bundle adherence (ie, ventilator-free bundle) (97% vs 72%, z = 5.47; P < .001).
3:::Among NYC residents, 8,827 HCC cases were diagnosed during 2001-2012. Significant clustering was detected in the HCC rates (Morans I = 0.25) with the strongest clustering found in HCC patients with comorbid HCV infection (Moran's I = 0.47). Poverty and uninsured status were associated (p < 0.05) with increased rates of HCC patients with HBV or HCV infection. Neighborhoods with high rates of HCC without viral hepatitis infection had lower rates of poverty and uninsured status.'
3:::All CMAP characteristics demonstrated high reproducibility within (ICCs>0.96) and between (ICCs>0.89) experimental sessions. No statistically significant bilateral or sex-based differences were found (p>0.05).
3:::Eighteen neonates were included. Immediate postoperative and peak levels of both NSE (58.0 [21.6] and 68.1 [55.7] μg/L) and s100B (0.14 [0.3] and 0.14 [0.3] μg/L) were significantly increased when compared with preoperative levels (34.0 [21.6] μg/L; P < 0.01 and 0.08 [0.1] μg/L; P < 0.02). By postoperative day seven, NSE and s100B levels were lower than preoperative levels: NSE (18 [5.7]; P = 0.09) and s100B (0.03 [0.05]; P < 0.01). Postoperative s100B levels were negatively correlated with age at surgery and positively correlated with circulatory arrest time. Although there was no significant correlation between either NSE or s100B levels and intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay, and pediatric cerebral performance category score, there was a negative correlation between postoperative levels of NSE and ventriculomegaly.
3:::A total of 105 patients had transcatheter replacement and 121 had surgical replacement. Patients in the transcatheter group were older (median age, 81 vs 68 years; P < .001) and had more comorbid conditions (median Charlson Comorbidity Index, 3 vs 2; P < .001). Patients in the transcatheter group also had lower incidence (19% vs 21%; P = .65) and odds of delirium developing (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9; P = .03). Delirium was independently associated with a 3-fold higher mortality by 6 months (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3-8.8; P = .01).
3:::The present study was to investigate the anticancer effects of crude extracts from Scutellaria barbata D. Don on ovarian cancer A2780 cells by MTT, DAPI staining, wound healing assay, transwell migration assay and western blotting analysis. Our study showed that Scutellaria barbata D. Don reduced the viability of A2780 cells and induced apoptosis by down-regulated Bcl-2 protein and increased Caspase 3/9 proteins. Furthermore, migration of A2780 cells were significantly inhibited by Scutellaria barbata D. Don and the underlying mechanism may be related to the decrease of MMP-2/9. The main constituents from Scutellaria barbata D. Don were identified to be thirteen flavonoids. A HPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis of Scutellaria barbata D. Don indicated the presence of 14 flavonoids compounds, which may contribute to the anticancer activity of the Scutellaria barbata D. Don.
3:::Independent of the storage solutions tested, chondrocyte survival rates were higher when stored at 4°C compared to storage at 37°C both after short-term (14days) and long-term storage (56days). At no point in time did the DMEM-based solution show a superior chondrocyte survival compared to lactated Ringer based solution. GAG and HP content were comparable across all time points, temperatures and solutions.
3:::Nine compounds (1-9) were isolated and structurally determined by spectroscopic methods, especially 2D NMR analyses. Ethanol extract treated groups showed inhibitory activity with IC50 value of 10.83 mg/mL. Betulin, ursolic acid and monotropein were isolated from P. decorate, and demonstrated with IC50 values of 6.88, 6.15 and 6.13 μg/mL, respectively.
3:::Estimated blood loss and blood transfusion volume was higher in OMC (ps < 0.001). The operative time was longer in RALC groups (p < 0.001). On POD0, interleukin (IL)-6 showed significant lower level in RALC-IUD compared to OMC (p = 0.016). IL-10 level was higher at POD0 (p = 0.029) and POD1 (p = 0.038) in OMC vs. RALC-EUD. MCP-1 levels for RALC-IUD were significantly lower compared to RALC-EUD (p = 0.027).'
3:::Altogether, 753 study subjects completed the trial per protocol (PP), 944 with violations (mITT), and the rest (n=301) were lost to follow-up (LTF). During the 6-month intervention, 331 subjects stopped smoking; 181 (18.2%) in the intervention arm and 150 (15.0%) in the placebo arm (OR=1.43; 95%CI=1.09-1.88); p=0.010). In the PP group, 170 (45.3%) quitted smoking in the intervention arm compared to 134 (35.4%) in the placebo arm (OR=1.51, 95%CI=1.12-2.02; p=0.006). In multivariate (Poisson regression) model, decreased level of smoking pleasure (p=0.010) and ""smoking sensations changed"" were powerful independent predictors of quit events (IRR=12.01; 95%CI=1.5-95.6).
3:::For surgical specimens, vectors displaying PFW and SYE improved transduction efficiency by 4.4- and 4.3-fold, respectively. The SYE-displaying vector was >2-fold more efficient for all seven cases, whereas the PFW-displaying vector increased efficiency in two out of four cases. For ascites samples, both vectors increased gene-transduction efficiency of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-positive ascites cells by >2-fold in two out of five cases.
3:::A total of 4997 patients were identified, including 60 MBC and 4937 FBC. Compared with FBC, patients with MBC were associated with a significantly higher rate of estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, unmarried, lung metastases, and a lower frequency of liver metastases. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed no significant difference in OS between MBC and FBC. In the propensity score-matched population, there was also no difference in survival between MBC and FBC. Multivariate analysis of MBC showed that OS was longer for patients aged 50-69 years and with estrogen receptor-positive disease.
3:::The detectability and calcium scores decreased at increasing IR levels (τb<-0.825, p<0.001) and increasing tube voltage (τb<-0.679, p<0.001). For 90kVp-IR3 and 100kVp-IR1, similar detectability and calcium score was found compared to the reference protocol (p>0.206). For these protocols, lower tube currents did not affect the detectability and Agatston score (p>0.206), while CNR and SNR were similar/higher compared to the reference protocol (0.008<p<0.206). Dose reduction was 60.6% (90kVp-IR3) and 43.6% (100kVp-IR1).
3:::A total of 208 (27%) household surveys were completed and returned. This school closure caused difficulties to 36 (17%) households; uncertain duration of closure, childcare arrangements, and lost pay were the most often reported difficulties. Having 1 adult in the household losing pay and household income below $25,000 were significantly associated with overall difficulty during this school closure. Concern about student health and safety was the most frequent theme in school administrator interviews.
3:::Compared with optic nerves in the control group, the mean FA was significant decreased (P<0.005), and the mean MD, λ//and λ⊥ significant increased (P<0.005). The average and temporal peripapillary RNFL thickness were significantly thinned in LHON patients. There was a significant correlation between optic nerve FA and VA, mean deviation of visual field (MDVF) (P<0.005). Also, optic nerve FA correlated significantly with average RNFL thickness (P<0.05) but not with MD, λ//and λ⊥ (P>0.05). However, none of the DTI parameters correlated with age and disease duration (P>0.05).
3:::Both peer educators and ninth graders perceived benefits of participating in Teen PEP across a range of domains, including intentions, skills, and knowledge and that the peer education modality was important in their valuation of the experience.
3:::BLES revealed fourteen (41.1%) high-risk lesions, ten (29.4%) ductal carcinomas in situ, and ten (29.4%) invasive cancers. Identical results between BLES and surgery were seen in 17/34 (50%) lesions. Surgery confirmed total excision of BLES in 15/34 (44.1%) lesions. Underestimation was seen in 2/34 (5.8%) lesions.
3:::Individual, organizational, intervention, and contextual factors influenced dissemination. Teachers reported that brain breaks increased student focus and engagement with classroom material and decreased student behavioral problems. Students decreased sedentary behavior and increased vigorous behavior. Of the 4 schools, 2 increased walking.
3:::Regarding the non-bleaching subgroups, all studied material revealed significant demineralization reduction in comparison to the control subgroup (P < 0.05). Ortho-Choice Ortho-Coat revealed the highest significant effect while GC Tooth Mousse showed the least effect. In bleached subgroups, Profluorid varnish, Enamel Pro Varnish, and Ortho-Choice Ortho-Coat significantly reduced demineralization (P < 0.05) while either GC MI Paste Plus or GC Tooth Mousse had no significant effects (P > 0.05).
3:::"High-PS spot"" and perihematoma regions had higher PS than the contralateral regions (p < 0.001). Hematoma PS was lower than that in the contralateral regions (p < 0.001). Perihematoma PS of the large-hematoma group was higher than that of the small-hematoma group (p = 0.011). Perihematomal edema volume correlated positively with hematoma volume (β = 0.864, p < 0.001) and perihematoma PS (β = 0.478, p < 0.001). Perihematoma PS correlated positively with hematoma volume (β = 0.373, p = 0.005)."
3:::Of the 132 patients included retrospectively, 27 (20.5%) patients developed HMs. The mean time to diagnosis of HM was 103.9±55.2days. HMs were multiple in 81.4% of cases and bilobar in 59.3% of cases; their mean maximum size was 16.7±12.7mm. In univariate logistic analysis, lymphovascular emboli were significantly associated with HM (p=0.02). No independent risk factors for HM were found in multivariate analysis. In multivariate logistic analysis, two independent risk factors were identified for the occurrence of early recurrence: tumor size >23mm on preoperative CT scan (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: [1.2-9.3]; p=0.02) and tumor differentiation (poor vs. good: OR 15.5; 95 CI [1.5-158.3]; moderate vs. good: OR: 17.1; 95% CI: [1.9-154.4]; p=0.04).
3:::The majority of the examined tracts (SLF and IFOF of both hemispheres, and the arcuate fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and ILF of the left hemisphere) followed a common pattern of metric changes with age. This pattern was characterized by significant FA increase accompanied by reduction in RD, Trace without significant AD changes. The right arcuate fasciculus showed similar pattern but without significant FA changes. The right uncinate and right ILF fasciculus demonstrated significant reduction in RD, Trace and AD, with and without significant FA increase, respectively. Left hemispheric dominance regarding the FA and diffusivity indices was demonstrated in uncinate fasciculus with no significant gender-related differences.
3:::The results revealed that D-AD patients exhibited increased ALFF values in the left caudate and thalamus and decreased ALFF values in the left middle temporal pole compared with nD-AD patients.
3:::Perianal abscess was found in 16 of the 36 patients. In 10 of these 16 patients there was also extensive inflammatory signal alterations in perianal and/or perineal soft tissues. In six of the 36 patients perianal fistula was detected. A sinus tract was seen at the level of subcutaneous external anal sphincter in one patient. Inflammatory signal alterations in the surrounding soft tissues were present in three of these seven patients. There were abscesses in labium majus in two patients and in one patient there were perineal abscesses with accompanying inflammatory signal alterations. In six of the 36 patients no abscess or fistula/sinus tract was seen. There were only inflammatory signal alterations with contrast enhancement in perianal or subcutaneous tissues. In two patients presenting with perianal pain and hemorrhoids, minimal inflammatory changes were detected on MR images. There were two patients with normal MR imaging findings.
3:::PD-A showed decreased glucose metabolism in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC, BA10 and BA11) when compared with PD-NA. Significant decrease of cerebral glucose metabolism in the bilateral OFC, bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA, BA6), bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC, BA32), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, BA9), right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC, BA44), right putamen and left caudatum was detected in PD-A compared with HCs. There was significant reduced glucose metabolism of the bilateral SMA in PD-NA when compared with HCs (uncorrected p<0.005).
3:::MSG was characterized by decreased naso-anal length, food and fluid intake, plasma protein and glucose decay rate per minute after insulin administration (KITT), as well as increased Lee index (body mass(0.33)/naso-anal length), mass of retroperitoneal and periepididymal fat pads, glycemia, triglycerides (TG), LDL and VLDL. Exenatide ameliorated KITT and food and fluid intake, and it also restored glycemia in MSG. DIO was characterized by glucose intolerance, increased body mass, Lee index, fluid intake, mass of retroperitoneal and periepididymal fat pads, glycemia, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), TG, VLDL and total cholesterol, as well as decreased food intake and KITT. Exenatide restored glycemia, HbA1c, TG, VLDL, total cholesterol and body mass, and it also ameliorated food and fluid intake, KITT and mass of retroperitoneal fat pad in DIO.
3:::Out of 100 RCTs selected, only 35 RCTs (35%) fully described the interventions in both the intervention and control groups. Control group interventions were poorly described in the remaining RCTs (65%).
3:::A total of 14 articles including 549 patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding were enrolled in the meta-analysis. The combined PLR, NLR and DOR were respectively 8.149, 0.158 and 56.213. There were significant heterogeneities in all estimations but we could not find the sources by meta-regression based on study design, study location, CT slices and sample size. The AUC and Q index under the fixed effect model was respectively 0.9463 and 0.8856.
3:::The OINHQ was in general reliable, with good internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.93) and interrater agreement (mean OAI = 75%; PABAκ = 0.49). NH quality is not homogeneous (overall mean = 2.9, ranging by facility between 1.9 and 3.7, on a scale of 1-5). Process-related indicators (mean = 2.7) are generally worse than structure-related indicators (mean = 3.5). The best domains were associated with Odors (mean = 4.1) and Grooming (mean = 3.9), whereas the priority domains for receiving improvement interventions were Care Delivery (mean = 2.0) and Environment-Homelike (mean = 2.5).
3:::The school nurses adopted the intervention readily, finding ways to incorporate healthy relationship discussions into interactions with students. School nurses and students found the intervention to be acceptable. Students were positive in their feedback. Barriers included difficulty with school buy-in and finding time and private spaces to deliver the intervention.
3:::Approaches to public engagement and success of implementation differed considerably across the three cases. Regions that presented the public with the reconfiguration plan alone reported greater public opposition and difficulty in implementing changes. Engagement activities that included a range of stakeholders and continued throughout the reconfiguration process appeared to largely address public concerns, contributing to smoother implementation.
3:::A total of 3 themes describe youth-perceived attributes of GSAs. First, youth identified GSAs as an opportunity to be members of a community, evidenced by their sense of emotional connection, support and belonging, opportunities for leadership, and fulfillment of needs. Second, GSAs served as a gateway to resources outside of the GSA, such as supportive adults and informal social locations. Third, GSAs represented safety.
3:::The average absolute distance between the CT and the various MR-based bone models were all below 1mm across all bones. The VIBE sequence provided the best agreement with the CT model, followed by the SPACE, then the TrueFISP data. The most notable difference was for the proximal tibia (VIBE 0.45mm, SPACE 0.82mm, TrueFISP 0.83mm).
3:::The difference between the automatic annulus diameter and the reference standard by observer 1 was 0.2±1.0mm, with an inter-observer variability of 1.2±0.6mm. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the diameter was good (0.92 for observer 1). For the first time, a fully automatic tool to assess the optimal projection curves was presented and validated. The mean difference between the optimal projection curves calculated based on the automatically defined annulus plane and the reference standard was 6.4° in the cranial/caudal (CRA/CAU) direction. The mean computation time was short with around 60s per dataset.
3:::There were thirteen men and four women with a mean age of 37.2 years (range, 27-52 years). There were no intraoperative complications related to this technology. All fractures healed within 14.1 weeks (range, 12 to 20 weeks). One patient required total hip replacement because of avascular necrosis of the femoral head at 27 months after surgery. According to the Harris hip score, eleven patients (64.7%) had excellent results, four (23.5%) had good results, one (5.9%) had moderate and one (5.9%) had poor result.
3:::Of 2348 UK combatants surviving injury in Iraq and Afghanistan, 1813 (77%) had extremity injuries; of these 205 (11%) had at least one amputation at the wrist/ankle or more proximal. Trans-tibial was the most common level of limb loss. Eighty five casualties lost 2 limbs, 83 of these (98%) lost both lower limbs and 17 lost 3 limbs. Aside from amputations, there were 1530 fractures, 501 (33%) involving the upper limb and 1029 (67%) in the lower limb and pelvis. The tibia was the most frequently fractured bone. Of the lower limb fractures, 597 (58%) were open compared with 344 (69%) in the upper limb. Total Length of Stay (LOS) following extremity injury was 24,486days or 69 years and 1 month; there were a total 2817 surgical episodes performed on extremities. Median length of stay Length of Stay (LOS) for major amputations (i.e. those at the wrist/ankle or more proximal) was 51days (IQR 30-65) with a median of 7 surgical procedures on their limbs (IQR 5-9). In casualties with fractures but no amputation, median LOS was 13days (IQR 6-25) with a median of 2 surgical procedures (IQR 1-4).
3:::The rats had similar repetition maximum before the resistance training. At the end of the resistance training period, the repetition maximum of the TG was 3.04-fold greater than the body weight. In the twelfth month, the left ventricular weight was 15.3% larger in the TG than in the CG, and the left ventricular internal diameter was reduced by 10% in the TG. Rats exposed to resistance training had a significant increase in aortic wall thickness, in both elastic lamina and collagen fibers, and in the thickness of collagen fibrils.
3:::WISC-IV Arithmetic and Digit Span Backward were most consistently related to inattentive behaviors, and no WM measure was consistently related to ADHD hyperactive/impulsive behaviors. Arithmetic and Digit Span Backward also accounted for significant variance in inattentive behaviors and ADHD inattention symptoms, respectively. Neither the WMI nor the Arithmetic subtest correctly classified individuals diagnosed with ADHD.
3:::Plan revisions for specific issues declined dramatically in response to implementation of corresponding Verifier tests. Between 2012 and 2015 our institutions total rate of plan revisions dropped from 18.0% to 11.2%. Between 2008 and 2015 specific tests were added to Verifier while the rate of corresponding avoidable safety events was reduced from 0.34% to 0.00% over the same period. Simulations suggest Verifier saves approximately 2 to 5 minutes per QCR.'
3:::The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for the SUVmax did not reveal significant differences in OS (p=0.48). The MTV survival analysis showed a significant higher OS in patients presenting with a higher tumour burden than those with less tumour burden (p=0.01; 26 vs. 14 months), whereas TLG exhibited a similar trend though not significant (p=0.06). Apart from chemo-resistance, the higher the MTV, the better will be the response to chemotherapy.
3:::The recurrence-free survival (RFS) at 5 years showed a significant difference between 3 groups: patients with circumferential resection margin (CRM) ≤1 mm, CRM 1.1 to 5 mm, and CRM >5 mm (46.2% vs 68.6% vs 77.5%, P<.001). Patients with CRM ≤1 mm showed a significantly higher cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence (P<.001) and distant metastasis (P<.001) at 5 years compared with the other 2 groups. Patients with CRM 1.1 to 5 mm showed a significantly higher cumulative incidence of distant metastasis (P<.001), but not locoregional recurrence (P=.192), compared with those with CRM >5 mm. Distal resection margin (≤5 vs >5 mm) did not show any significant difference in cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrence (P=.310) and distant metastasis (P=.926).
3:::The low-risk (LR) group had a significantly lower risk of early DBF than did the high-risk (HR) group (22.6% vs 44%, P=.004), but there was no difference between the HR and intermediate-risk (IR) groups (41.2% vs 44%, P=.79). Total lesion volume <1.3 cm(3) (P=.004), malignant melanoma (P=.007), and multiple metastases (P<.001) were validated as predictors for early DBF. Prior WBRT and breast cancer histologic features did not retain prognostic significance. Risk stratification for risk of early salvage WBRT were similar, with a trend toward an increased risk for HR compared with LR (P=.09) but no difference between IR and HR (P=.53).
3:::Global measures showed a high correlation (breast volume R=0.99, volume of glandular tissue R=0.94, and volumetric breast density R=0.96) regardless the anode/filter material. Similarly, histogram intersection and correlation metric showed that, for each pair, the images share a high degree of information. Regarding the local distribution of glandular tissue, small changes in the angle of view do not yield significant differences in the glandular pattern, whilst changes in the breast thickness between both acquisition affect the spatial parenchymal distribution.
3:::Sixteen of 65 patients (24.6%) experienced RILT2. Lower pre IL-8 and higher TGF-β1 2w/pre ratio were associated with higher risk of RILT2. The AUC increased to 0.73 by combining MLD, pre IL-8, and TGF-β1 2w/pre ratio compared with 0.61 by MLD alone to predict RILT. In all 142 patients, 29 patients (20.4%) experienced grade ≥2 RILT. Among the 30 cytokines measured, only IL-8 and TGF-β1 were significantly associated with the risk of RILT2. MLD, pre IL-8 level, and TGF-β1 2w/pre ratio were included in the final predictive model. The AUC increased to 0.76 by combining MLD, pre IL-8, and TGF-β1 2w/pre ratio compared with 0.62 by MLD alone.
3:::The BMI-adjusted ultra-low-dose protocol reached high diagnostic accuracy values of 94% for Reader 1 and 93% for Reader 2. Moreover, in comparison to the ISP, it showed significantly (p<0.001) lower CTDIvol (1.97±0.55mGy vs. 4.18±0.62 mGy) and DLP (256±81mGy x cm vs. 544±83mGy x cm) but similar image quality (p=0.37 for CNR). Furthermore, image quality was similar between BMI groups (p=0.86 for CNR).
3:::Eight men and 12 women with a median age of 61 years enrolled. Two-year overall survival was 88% (95% confidence interval 68%-100%). There was no significant decline in performance between baseline and 6 or 12 months for any of the tests. The association between baseline intelligence quotient and change in performance on testing was not significant. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed asymptomatic brain metastases at a cumulative rate of 20%, with no concurrent extracranial progression. Two patients developed a metastasis in the under-dosed region. Neither involved the dentate gyrus, but 1 involved the avoidance region. Both patients concurrently developed additional metastasis in fully treated brain regions. There were 2 neurologic deaths.
3:::A total of 308 patients completed the study. Of these, 245 (79.6%) experienced no statistically significant changes on any test whereas 63 (20.4%) experienced significant changes on ≥1 test. Most of these patients showed a change on only 1 test, distributed evenly between improvement (58 patients, 18.8%) and worsening (56 patients, 18.2%). For individual tests, most patients (87.8%-91.8%) had no change from baseline; however, the significant changes (improvement vs deterioration) were as follows: WAIS III Digit Span subtest (6.3% vs 5.9%), visual memory (5.3% vs 5.7%), Judgment of Line Orientation test (5.3% vs 4.5%), Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects test (4.1% vs 4.1%), and WAIS III Matrix Reasoning test (4.8% vs 5.8%).
3:::In PD-NC versus HC, results indicated decreased PCC-FC in the right temporal gyrus(TG) and increased PCC-FC in the left medial temporal lobe(MTL), bilateral precuneus(Pcu), and parieto-occipital junction(POJ), as well as GM atrophy in the bilateral prefrontal-striatal circuit(pFTSC), TG and Pcu. In PD-MCI versus PD-NC, decreased PCC-FC was found in the bilateral prefrontal cortex(PFC), left POJ, and right TG. In addition, PCC-FC of the bilateral Pcu and GM volume of the left MTL, bilateral TG, and PFC were positively associated with cognitive score.
3:::Median follow-up was 48.8 months. Among the 102 patients, 44 (43.1%) developed HT within 2 years after radiation therapy. The median time to HT was 36.7 months (range, 24.9-49.0 months). The 1-year and 2-year cumulative incidence rates of HT were 33% and 44.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that younger age, early T stage, minimum dose to the thyroid gland, V40, and V45 were associated with HT. On multivariate analysis, younger age (P=.017), early T stage (P=.005), and V40 (P=.009) remained statistically significant. Patients with V40 > 85% had significantly higher cumulative incidence rates of HT than patients with V40 ≤ 85% (P=.007).
3:::Of 595 patients treated radically between May 21, 2012, and May 21, 2014, 548 patients were entered, giving a compliance of 92.1%. The vast majority were treated with IMRT (470/548, 89%), 49.3% treated definitively and 50.7% treated adjuvantly; overall, 63% had stage IV disease. Eighty-one patients (14.8%) had 1 or more major changes recommended and implemented, and 21 patients (3.8%) had major changes recommended but not implemented because of a lack of consensus. Of minor recommendations, in 115 patients (21%) they were implemented and in 13 patients (2.4%) they were not implemented. No changes were recommended in the remaining 324 patients (59.1%). The only factor correlating with the likelihood of a major change was treatment with IMRT (P=.001). In the vast majority of cases (85%), the time taken for IMRT QA was less than 20 minutes.
3:::We found bronchoceles >5mm in 13/43 patients. 5/13 patients had a positive diagnosis of ABPA. The median HU value of bronchoceles was higher in patients with than without ABPA [98 HU (26-135) vs 28 HU (10-36); P=0,02]. Moreover, all patients with a bronchocele density >36HU were ABPA positive.
3:::Out of the maximum of 80, the average DISCERN quality score for the websites was 55.1 (SD- 12.3, Median- 60.5). The mean score for FRES was 42.3 (SD- 15.9, Median- 45.5), which falls in the range defined as difficult. No website was above the optimal score of 65. The mean score for the FKGL was US grade-level of 10.7 (SD- 1.6, Median- 11.6). Only 4(27%) websites were in the optimal range of 6-8. There was very weak correlation between FRES and DISCERN (r = 0.07) and FKGL and DISCERN (r = 0.21).
3:::A total of 1304 subjects were included in this analysis, 326 of whom were in the case group and 978 of whom were in the control group. Within their age group, subjects with osteoporosis were more often underweight (odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-4.98) or more often current smokers (2.22, 1.50-3.28) than control subjects. The subjects who were overweight (0.45, 0.32-0.64), obese (0.19, 0.13-0.27), had an irregular exercise habit (0.64, 0.43-0.94), or had a regular exercise habit (0.40, 0.28-0.57) were more likely to have normal bone status. Alcohol drinking habit had no significant association with male osteoporosis.
3:::For the short scan time protocols, a diagnostic peak enhancement was achieved using 20mL of CA at 70 and 80kVp (PAE: 327±10 and 255±15 HU, respectively) or 30mL of CA at 70, 80 and 100kVp (PAE 451±10, 367±9, and 253±15 HU). For the long scan time, the optimized multi-bolus injection protocol extended T200 at 100kVp by 6s (40%) compared to a linear injection protocol (21±1s and 15±1s, respectively; p<0.001).
3:::Metastases of EL4-RFP were observed in the liver, ascites and bone marrow. Primary tumors were imaged in the spleen at the injection site. The fewest metastases were observed in the fatty liver. In addition, the fewest cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were observed in the fatty liver.
3:::IQM suppressed B16F10 melanoma growth in parallel with reduction of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) at the tumor site, caused by the down-regulation of CCL22 production by tumor-derived and splenic CD11b(+) cells. Subsequently, we investigated the antitumor or tumor-loading effects of splenic CD11b(+) cells on B16F10 melanoma growth in vivo. B16F10 melanoma growth was accelerated by splenic CD11b(+) cells from untreated mice, but was inhibited by splenic CD11b(+) cells from IQM-treated mice. Consistent with these results, Foxp3(+) Tregs were significantly decreased in tumors of mice implanted with both melanoma and splenic CD11b(+) cells from topical IQM-treated mice. Furthermore, intratumoral administration of anti-CCL22 antibody inhibited B16F10 melanoma growth by decreasing Treg recruitment at the tumor site.
3:::Postoperative complications occurred in 35.5% of the patients. The mortality rate was 3.2%. Patients with preoperative C-reactive protein above 40mg/l showed more overall complications and a higher mortality than patients below this limit. Patients with a CRP level between 3mg/l and 40mg/l had no significant increase in morbidity and mortality compared to patients with values ​​below the detection limit (< 3mg/l).
3:::High levels of curcumin were measured in PBMCs (625.5 ng/g w.w. cell pellet or 7,297 pg/10(6) cells in dog and 353.7 ng/g w.w. cell pellet or 6,809 pg/10(6) cells in human) and in hepatocytes (414.5 ng/g w.w. cell pellet or 14,005 pg/10(6) cells in dog and 813.5 ng/g w.w. cell pellet or 13,780 pg/10(6) cells in human). Lower curcumin levels were measured in red blood cells (dog: 78.4 ng/g w.w. cell pellet or 7.2 pg/10(6) cells, human: 201.5 ng/g w.w. cell pellet or 18.6 pg/10(6) cells). A decrease in the medium concentration of curcumin was observed in red blood cells and hepatocytes, but not in PBMCs. Red blood cell levels of THC were ~5-fold higher in dog compared to human and similar between dog and human for hepatocytes and PBMCs. The ratio of THC to curcumin found in the red blood cell medium following incubation was 6.3 for dog compared to 0.006 for human, while for PBMCs and hepatocytes the ratio of THC to curcumin in the medium did not display such marked species differences.
3:::In 284 patients with PET-CT-staged clinical T1-2N0 disease, the prevalence of occult N2 metastases was 7.0%. The negative predictive value of PET-CT was 92.9% and the negative predictive value of mediastinoscopy/EBUS was 96.3%. T2 tumors were more likely to have occult N2 disease than T1 tumors (11.8% v 3.6% p=0.009). Pure solid tumors had greater involvement of N2 nodes than tumors with any ground glass component (12.6% v 3.1%, p<0.001). 17.5% of central tumor cases were found to have occult N2 metastases while 4.4% of patients with peripheral tumors (P<0.001). 33.3% of patients with solid central T2 tumors had occult N2 metastases whereas 2.0% of patients with peripheral T2 tumors with a ground glass component, 1.2% of patients with peripheral T1 tumors with a ground glass component and 3.6% of patients with peripheral T1 solid tumors had N2 metastases.
3:::Plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were significantly decreased at day 8 (20.1±4.0 pg/ml vs. 9.1±1.8 pg/ml, p=0.0002). Patients whose plasma BNP level was reduced to <50% of the baseline at day 8 had a longer progression-free survival (PFS) than those with a less decrease (9.73 versus 2.63 months, p=0.00013). In multivariate Cox analysis, decrease of plasma BNP concentration was associated with a longer PFS (p=0.0022).
3:::MTT assays presented that CSE claimed antagonistic effect on gefitinib sensitivity via the up-regulated half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, western blot showed that CSE instigated EGFR, AKT phosphorylation, while N-Acetyl-l-Cysteine (NAC) could alleviate gefitinib resistance and abort the aberrant phosphorylation in both PC-9 and A549 cells. Confocal microscope and flow cytometry displayed that ROS generation increased after CSE exposure in NSCLC cells and this change could be inhibited by NAC.
3:::Average operative time was 43min. Improvement of both subjective Lysholm score (mean 93) and objective stability testing by posterior drawer test (returns to normal in 81.1% of patients) at the final follow-up. Good radiographic union at average of 5.6 weeks. No morbidity of the gastrocnemius with few complications.
3:::Itraconazole suppressed proliferation of CaSki and HeLa cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, CaSki cells were more significantly affected by itraconazole than HeLa cells. The microarray analysis showed an 8-fold down-regulation in the expression of GLI1, WNT4 and WNT10A among itraconazole-treated CaSki cells. Moreover, the transcription of sterol carrier protein-2 and ATP-binding cassette transporter-1 was unaffected by itraconazole. Immunoblots showed suppression in β-catenin expression and Akt phosphorylation.
3:::Significantly higher total activity of ADH was found in sera of both, low-grade and high-grade bladder cancer patients. The diagnostic sensitivity for total ADH activity was 81.5%, specificity 98.1%, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were 97.4% and 92.3% respectively. Area under ROC curve for total ADH activity was 0.848.
3:::Perioperative outcomes included stroke (n = 4), reoperation for bleeding (n = 23), renal failure requiring temporary dialysis (n = 18), readmissions before 30 days (n = 86), and operative death before 30 days (n = 16; ratio of observed to expected mortality [O/E ratio], 0.50). Independent predictors for 1-year and 5-year rhythm success were a shorter history of atrial fibrillation (1-year odds ratio [OR], 0.93, p = 0.001; 5-year OR, 0.93, p = 0.042) and cryothermia alone (1-year OR=1.77, p = 0.020; 5-year OR = 2.29, p = 0.009). After matching, group 1 had significantly higher sinus rhythm without antiarrhythmic drugs at 6 months (79% vs 70%; p = 0.016), 36 months (81% vs 69%; p = 0.010), and 60 months (75% vs 57%; p = 0.008). Stroke incidence was lower for group 1 (0.7% vs 3%; p = 0.033), with no difference in major bleeding (10% vs 11%; p = 0.597). Groups had similar survival rates (log rank, 0.6; p = 0.452).
3:::Benign esophageal perforation was treated in 659 patients (mean age, 49 years; 41% women), comprising surgical repair in 449 (69%), surgical drainage in 110 (17%), and stent in 100 (15%). Stent use increased from 7% in 2007 to 30% in 2014 (p < 0.001 for trend). Over the same period, surgical repair decreased from 71% to 53% (p = 0.001 for trend), but surgical drainage did not change (p = 0.24). After adjustment for other factors that could vary over time, stent use increased by 28% per year (incidence rate ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.17 to 1.39). Changes in risk-adjusted deaths, discharges home, readmissions, or costs over the same period were not significant (all p > 0.05 for trend).
3:::The results showed that the three polymorphisms were not significantly associated with increased risk of lung cancer in the overall investigated population. Furthermore, when the analyses were stratified according to age, sex, status of smoking and drinking, pack-years of smoking and family history of lung cancer, there was also no significant association between these genotypes and increased lung cancer risk.
3:::In the group of rats subjected to PT, a significantly higher progesterone level was observed. The highest progesterone level was noted in the low-intensity PT group. An increase in apoptosis of MNU-induced tumor cells was also demonstrated in the PT groups.
3:::Satisfaction ratings were equivalent for both treatment groups. Patients in the UP+TAU group evidenced significantly greater reductions over time in anxiety and depression symptoms (Cohens d's>0.80). Baseline levels of neuroticism, perceived affective control, and emotion regulation ability predicted magnitude of symptom change for the UP+TAU group only. Greater change in perceived control of emotions and emotion regulation skills predicted greater change in anxiety related symptoms.'
3:::MiR-505 is lowly expressed in cervical cancer cell lines and human carcinomas. Low tumorous miR-505 expression was associated with patients advanced tumor stage and short survival. In Ca-Ski and HeLa cells, lentivirus-mediated miR-505 upregulation suppressed cancer proliferation and invasion in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo, whereas miR-505 downregulation had no functional effects. FZD4 was confirmed to be a downstream target of miR-505, and found to be upregulated in cervical cancer. Genetic modification of FZD4 in cervical cancer cells yielded a significant change in cancer growth, as FZD4 upregulation suppressed whereas FZD4 downregulation promoted cervical cancer proliferation and invasion In vitro.'
3:::In the clinical analyzing, compared with adjacent tissues, the pathological was significantly changed in tumor tissues, the GHET1 gene and protein expressions were significantly increased in the GC tissues. In the cell experiment, down-regulation of GHET1 had suppressed the cell proliferation, invasion and migration activities and enhanced the cell apoptosis and G1 phase. We found that knockdown of GHET1 dramatically increased E-cadherin, while reducing fibronectin and vimentin.
3:::Mean tumor volume for LND+TMZ for the period between 6 and 26 days was reduced compared to TMZ alone (repeated measures ANOVA F (1, 8), p=0.006), suggesting a pronounced impact of LND on this phenomenon. TMZ and LND+TMZ produced median growth delays of 82 and 106 days, respectively.
3:::CRMDCT showed significant lower attenuation values compared to CRDLCT and MonoE at 40-70keV (p≤0.05). Moreover, MonoE at 40-70keV revealed significantly higher attenuations values compared to CRDLCT (p<0.001). Noise was statistically lower in CRMDCT compared with CRDLCT and MonoE at 40keV (11.4±2.3 HU vs. 12.0±3.1 HU vs. 11.7±5.2 HU; p<0.001). In contrast, all MonoE levels showed significantly lower noise levels compared to CRDLCT (p<0.001). SNR was not significantly different between CRMDCT and CRDLCT (13.5±3.7 vs. 14.4±5.3; p>0.99). SNR values were significantly increased for MonoE at 40-80keV compared to CRMDCT and CRDLCT (p<0.001). CRDLCT and MonoE (40-70keV) from DLCT revealed significantly higher CNR values than CRMDCT (p<0.001). In subjective analysis, MonoE at 40keV surpassed all other image reconstructions except for noise in MonoE at 70 keV.
3:::Central laboratory testing was successful in 99% of samples passing histopathology review and testing success rates were comparable across the three central laboratories. Concordance between central and local testing for common sensitizing mutations was high (>98%) and concordance for the T790M mutation was also high (>90%). Tumor heterogeneity, along with other technical factors may have influenced this result.
3:::During the median follow-up of 3.9 years (IQR 1.6-6.6) late biliary complications were observed in 24 (13.8%) patients. Cumulative biliary related morbidity at 3 and 5 years was 7.6% and 10.8%, respectively. CBD stone recurrence was observed in 9 (5.2%) patients. On-demand cholecystectomy was performed in 6 (3.3%) patients. 30-day mortality was 3.9% and 30-day morbidity 9.4%. Overall cumulative mortality rate at 3 and 5 years after ES was 31.4% and 49.7%, respectively. Long-term biliary related mortality was 1.7%. No significant difference in long term complications or biliary mortality was observed between patients< 75 or ≥75 years of age.
3:::One hundred and seven students, 76 third year (Group A) and 31 fourth year (Group B) answered the questionnaire. In Group A, 98.68% of students and in Group B 93.54% believed they were poorly informed; 100% of both groups would prefer to receive more training as part of the degree or as postgraduate training through modular courses imparted by experts (A: 71,05%, B: 70,96%) Training through postgraduate programs or training given by private businesses were the least desirable options (A: 42%, B: 64.51%). Questions about basic knowledge acquired received varying responses, which might indicate a certain level of confusion in this area.
3:::74 consecutive oral cancer patients (59.5% males; median age: 65.0 years (IQ:57-74)) were studied. Most cases (52.7%; n=39) were at advanced stages (TNM III-IV) at diagnosis. The period since first sign/symptom until the patient seeks health care was the longest interval in the pathway to diagnosis and treatment (median: 31.5 days; IQR= 7.0 - 61.0) and represents >60% of the interval since symptom onset until referral to specialised care (pre-referral interval). The average interval assigned to the patient resulted to be relatively larger than the time elapsed since the patient is seen at primary care until a definitive diagnosis is reached (diagnostic interval). Median of the referral interval for primary care professionals: 6.5 days (IQR= 0.0 - 49.2) and accounts for 35% (19% - 51%) of the diagnostic interval.
3:::Bleeding on probing without periodontal pockets was present in 5.2%, calculus without periodontal pockets in 42.1%, shallow periodontal pockets in 39.5% and deep periodontal pockets in 13.2% of dentate patients. There were 28.8% edentulous participants. 63.1% of the patients had CRP levels higher than 3 mg/L and 34.2% higher than 10 mg/L. TnT was detectable in all participants, with 25.2% exhibiting levels higher than 100 ng/L. The median level of NOx was 43.1 µmol/L. Participants with higher CRP were more likely to be edentulous and have higher TnT levels. A direct association of oral health with TnT or NOx was not detected.
3:::Histopathology confirmed the presence of gastric cancer in 28 patients (70%), while gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) were recognized in the remaining 12 cases (30%). Correct diagnoses of the type of gastric tumor in hydro-CT were obtained in 37 patients (92.5%). This was not significantly different from the 85% accuracy of endoscopy. Further analysis showed that the correctness of GIST diagnosis in endoscopy and hydro-CT also did not differ significantly (91.7% and 100% respectively). The percentage of correctly diagnosed malignant lesions in hydro-CT was lower than for GISTs at 89.29%, while in endoscopy it was insignificantly lower (82.14%). The diagnostic accuracy of conventional and low-dose hydro-CT in the diagnosis of gastric tumors (95% and 90% respectively) was not significantly different.
3:::Over 112.5 ± 88.4 months, 135 episodes of renal flare occurred, giving a flare rate of 0.108 episodes per patient-year. The renal relapse-free survival rate was 96%, 90%, 86%, 80%, 69%, and 57% after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 years, respectively, calculated from the start of induction treatment. Reduced risk of flare was associated with MPA maintenance (OR 0.314, 95% CI 0.099-0.994, p = 0.049), complete remission after induction immunosuppression (OR 0.329, 95% CI 0.133-0.810, p = 0.016), and diagnosis after 1998 (OR 0.305, 95% CI 0.133-0.700, p = 0.005). Relapse-free survival was significantly better in patients treated with prednisolone and MPA as maintenance immunosuppression (91% after 5 yrs and 83% after 10 yrs, respectively) compared with prednisolone and AZA (70% and 52%, respectively, p = 0.044). LN diagnosed in 1998-2013 showed 5-year and 10-year relapse-free survival rates of 93% and 86%, respectively, compared with 81% and 66%, respectively (p = 0.017) for LN that presented in 1983-1997.
3:::The optimal cut-off point for serum cotinine was 10 ng/ml. Serum cotinine showed greater association with severity of CAL than self-report for mild-moderate CAL [OR 2.03 (CI95% 1.16-3.53) vs. OR 1.08 (CI95% 0.62-1.87) ] advanced periodontitis [OR 2.36 (CI95% 1.30- 4.31) vs. OR 2.06 (CI95% 0.97-4.38) ] and extension of CAL > 3 mm [ OR 1.78 (CI95% 1.16-1.71) vs. 1.37 (CI95% 0.89-2.11)]. When the two tests were evaluated together were not shown to be better than serum cotinine test.
3:::Working life: both women (55.6%) and men (51.04%) were similarly affected, but women had worse disease activity (5.4 vs 4.0, p = 0.01) and less antitumor necrosis factor-α therapy (56.7% vs 77.6%, p < 0.05). Different patterns were found by gender: women mostly practiced presenteeism whereas men practiced absenteeism, women took antiinflammatories prior to work and men after work, employers suggested more frequently the beneficial actions for men, and some women withdrew permanently from the labor market. Family/partner relationships: women were more affected (57.4%) than men (41.7%), with worse results for diagnostic delay (11.2 vs 6.4 yrs, p = 0.02), disease activity (5.8 vs 3.6, p < 0.001), and physical function (5.2 vs 3.8, p = 0.02). Gender role conflicts emerged, with women developing strategies to face compulsory housework whereas men avoided them; women regretted neglecting their children and men not sharing leisure activities with them.
3:::Blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, insulin, IR, serum leptin, lipid profiles, inflammatory cytokines, lipid peroxidation increased significantly (P<0.01) while serum adiponectin, antioxidant activities (superoxide dismutase, glutathione), exercise performance significantly decreased (P<0.001) in the DC group compared with the control group. Combined effects of exercise and melatonin ameliorated markedly hypertension, IR, biochemical alteration induced by diabetes and significantly increased exercise performance (P<0.01). The expression glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) mitochondrial biogenesis related proteins such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1 α), nuclear respiratory factor (NRFs) and mitochondrial transcription factor-A were up-regulated skeletal and cardiac muscle in the DME group.
3:::The investigation of biomarkers and their potential as a predictor, diagnosis instrument and therapeutic orientation, requires an appropriate methodological strategy. In this review, we found different laboratory techniques to identify biomarkers and their function in schizophrenia.
3:::The global phytochemical profile of AcAE reveals the presence of several polyphenols as main components. A. campestris L. infusion was characterized by mono- and di-cinnamoyl compounds, with 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic (isochlorogenic A) acid being the main compound, followed by 5-caffeoylquinic (chlorogenic) acid. Vicenin-2 (apigenin 6,8-di-C-glucoside) appeared to be the most abundant compound among flavonoids. The daily treatment with AcAE at 150mg/kg/day prevented the installation of hypertension on L-NAME hypertensive rats, and reduced SBP from 172mmHg up to 144mmHg. At the dose 40mg/kg, AcAE provoked reduction of systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), without affecting the heart rate. Also, AcAE (10(-2)-2mg/ml) relaxed the precontracted aorta by 95.8±1.3%. The denudation and preincubation of aorta with atropine, calmidazolium, L-NAME, hydroxycobalamin, ODQ, 8-RP-Br-PET-cGMP, thapsigargin and verapamil attenuated the vasorelaxant response, while the pre-treatment with 4-AP, TEA, glibenclamide and BaCl2 did not alter this effect. The oral administration of AcAE (0-6g/kg) reveals no mortality or toxicity.
3:::Using the main definition of adherence, there were no significant differences between late anti-TNF users and timely anti-TNF users in total costs (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.54-1.36, p = 0.516) or nonbiologic costs (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.44-1.18, p = 0.187). However, in the sensitivity analysis, late anti-TNF users had significantly increased nonbiologic costs compared with timely users (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.06-2.36, p = 0.026). In the main analysis, there were no significant differences in QALY between timely anti-TNF users and late anti-TNF users, or between timely users and patients with unmet anti-TNF need. In the sensitivity analysis, patients with unmet anti-TNF need had significantly lower QALY than timely anti-TNF users (-0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01, p = 0.016).
3:::VCM1 scores improved with AU resolution. VCM1 did not correlate with vision at baseline, but did on resolution of inflammation. Physical SF-36 scores were reduced during AU episodes and improved on resolution remaining below those of population norms. Subanalysis revealed that SpA scores were more affected than the idiopathic AU group.
3:::Only one out of 294 single blastomeres (0.34%) would have resulted in a false-negative diagnosis. False-positive diagnoses were not detected.
3:::Of 609,207 children, 58,299 (9.6%) were victims of an assault. The median age was 16 years and 81% were male, with a median injury severity score (ISS) of 8. The majority of patients were adolescents (76%), followed by infants (17%) and young children (4%). There was a stepwise increase in the proportion of assaulted Black children with increasing age (23.2% for infants and up to 46.7% for adolescents, trend p < 0.01, effect size: 0.175) while the opposite applied for White children (46.0% for infants and down to 19.5% for adolescents, trend p < 0.01, effect size: -0.230). With increasing age, White subjects had the highest trend of being assaulted during an unarmed fight or brawl (p < 0.01, effect size: 0.393), while for Black victims the highest trend was noted for assault with a firearm (p < 0.01, effect size: 0.323). Almost 2 out of 3 infants sustained severe head trauma (59%). The overall mortality was 8%, highest among young children, where it reached 16% (p < 0.01).
3:::Systematic search of PubMed resulted in 12 studies discussing ALR in multiple types of cancer. More specifically, ALR appears to be up-regulated in malignant cells and tissues. Furthermore, treatment of cells with exogenous ALR shows an anti-apoptotic effect while silencing or inhibiting ALR decreases cell and tumor survival.
3:::Regarding the AJAX trial, the original article had reported the rate of outcomes at 30 days after repair in two tables. The plots additionally demonstrated the moments of occurrence, increase and decrease of multiple outcomes such as renal replacement therapy and occurrence of death within one plot. These observations were not presented in the original article. The lasagna plots of the LAFA and DROP trial revealed similar new observations on multiple longitudinal outcomes.
3:::Anthracimycin suppressed cell proliferation and motility and induced apoptosis in human HCC cell lines. Furthermore, anthracimycin had no effect on the enrichment of EpCAM-high liver cancer stem cells (CSCs), while fluorouracil dramatically enriched the CSCs with activation of the stemness-related genes EPCAM and SOX9 in HuH7 cells. Mechanistically, anthracimycin suppressed mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, and was most effective at inhibiting HCC cell proliferation with mTOR activation.
3:::The method was applied to a marmoset dataset after a tracer had been injected into an auditory belt area to fluorescently label axonal projections. Cortical and subcortical connections were clearly reconstructed in 3D. The registration error was estimated to be smaller than 200 μm. Evaluation tests on ICA-based autofluorescence reduction showed a significant improvement in signal and background separation.
3:::Some drugs appear to be feasible options for patients with hepatic insufficiency. Agents such as 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin, as well as monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab, can potentially be used in these cases. On the other hand, irinotecan and regorafenib cannot be recommended because of the risk of increased toxicity.
3:::We show that GCV has a direct suppressive activity on HIV replication in human tissues ex vivo, including laboratory strains, drug-resistant and primate HIV-1 isolates. We deciphered the mechanism of this inhibition and showed that GCV-TP is incorporated in the nascent DNA chain and acts as a delayed chain terminator.
3:::A total of 7349 patients were identified meeting study criteria, of whom 1187 were elderly (aged >70 years) with a median follow-up of 30.6 months. Of these elderly patients, 445 had ECE or positive margin and represent the study population, of whom 187 (42%) received CRT. Delivery of CRT in this cohort increased over the study period, and intensity modulated radiation therapy was associated with increased use of CRT (odds ratio 2.07; P=.004). Increasing age was associated with reduced use of CRT (odds ratio 0.88; P<.001). Chemoradiotherapy was associated with a significant improvement in OS on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 0.74; P=.04) and a trend toward significance on inverse propensity score analysis (hazard ratio 0.78; P=.051). Three-year OS was 53.8% in the CRT group, compared with 44.6% in the adjuvant radiation therapy-alone patients.
3:::Compared to HCs, patients with NMOSD had significantly lower mean global fractional anisotropy, higher mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity, and no significant differences in axial diffusivity in their NAWM. Patients with MS demonstrated significantly lower mean global fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity in the NAWM than did patients with NMOSD and HCs. Compared to patients with NMOSD, patients with MS had NAWM damage that was more extensive, particularly in the inferior cerebellar peduncle, external capsule, cingulum, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus.
3:::One month post-challenge, 331 participants in the Hexavac cohort [83.6%, 95% CI: 79.6; 87.1] and 324 in the Infanrix hexa cohort [96.4%, 95% CI: 93.8; 98.1] had anti-HBs concentrations ≥10mIU/mL. Before the challenge dose, an anti-HBs concentration of ≥10mIU/mL was found in 94 children in the Hexavac cohort [23.9%, 95% CI: 19.7; 28.4] and in 232 children in the Infanrix hexa cohort [69%, 95% CI: 63.8; 74.0]. Among children with a pre-challenge anti-HBs concentration of <10mIU/mL, 236 [78.7%, 95% CI: 73.6; 83.2] in the Hexavac cohort and 92 [88.5%, 95% CI: 80.7; 93.9] in the Infanrix hexa cohort achieved protective anti-HBs antibody concentrations. No evidence of active hepatitis B disease was observed in either group, and the HBVaxPro challenge dose was well tolerated.
3:::IC50 values obtained were 11.40, 27.31, 15.93 and 15.70 μM for lymphocytes, K562, HL-60 and Jurkat cells, respectively. In K562 cells, 4-NRC (27 μM) promoted apoptosis as verified by cellular morphological changes, a significant increase in PS externalization and sub-G1 cells. Moreover, it significantly arrested the cells at the G0/G1 phase due to a reduction in cyclin D1 expression. These effects of 4-NRC also significantly promoted a reduction in mitochondrial activity and membrane depolarization, accumulation of cytosolic cytochrome c and ROS overproduction. Additionally, it triggered an increase in caspases -3/7, -8 and -9 activities. When the cells were pretreated with N-acetyl-l-cysteine ROS scavenger, 4-NRC-induced apoptosis was partially blocked, which suggests that it exerts cytotoxicity though not exclusively through ROS-mediated mechanisms.
3:::Only 47.9% and 31.3% of subjects showed an SBA titre consistent with protection one and four years, respectively, after the last boost. Protective SBA titres were observed in all sera against B or C strains that entirely matched P1.7,16, and was high (75-100%) for all but one strain that partially matched VR1 or VR2. Extrapolating our data to the OMV component of 4CMenB/Bexsero® suggests that 14.5% of the current B strains would be covered based on PorA matching to the OMV component of 4CMenB/Bexsero® (regardless of the coverage of the three other vaccine components).
3:::Among 191 women under surveillance for a median of 3.7 years who underwent treatment for HGVIN/vulvar cancer, primary vulvar lesions included VIN 2 (10, 5%), VIN 3 (102, 53%), and carcinoma (79, 41%). During follow-up, 71 (37%) had abnormal cytology, including 47 (25%) low grade, 23 (12%) high grade, and 1 (0.5%) carcinoma. Subsequent risk for VAIN 2+ was 11% (6/57) after previous hysterectomy and 8% for CIN 2+ (10/124) with intact cervix. Overall risk for CIN 3+ was 5%. Correlates of high-grade cytology after treatment for HGVIN/vulvar cancer included nonwhite race (odds ratio [OR] = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.50-7.36), immunodeficiency (OR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.76-9.94), and previous abnormal cytology (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.29-5.78). Stepwise multivariate analysis revealed immunosuppression as the only significant correlate of high-grade cytology after vulvar treatment (adjusted OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.26-10.83).
3:::A total of 70 patients were evaluated in each cohort. Operative times and conversion rates were similar. LB patients had lower post-anesthesia care unit pain scores (P = .001) and used less opioids through postoperative day 3 (day 0 P < .01; day 1 P = .03; day 2 P = .02; day 3 P < .01). Daily pain scores were comparable. LB had shorter LOS (mean 2.96 vs 3.93 days; P = .003) and trended toward lower readmission, complication, and reoperation rates. Total costs/patient were $746 less with LB, a savings of $52,200 across the cohort.
3:::No significant difference was found in vascular risk factors, years of education, or underlying cognitive function between the 2 groups. More than half of the patients in each group performed preceding Valsalva-associated activities. Multiple hippocampal lesions or concomitant lesions in the cingulate gyrus were found only in the TGA group.
3:::Hemoglobin and brain natriuretic peptide levels (300 pg/ml [HFpEF]; 397 pg/ml [HFmrEF]; 521 pg/ml [HFrEF]; ptrend <0.001) showed an upward trend with decreasing LVEF. Network analysis showed that in HFrEF interactions between biomarkers were mostly related to cardiac stretch, whereas in HFpEF, biomarker interactions were mostly related to inflammation. In HFmrEF, biomarker interactions were both related to inflammation and cardiac stretch. In HFpEF and HFmrEF (but not in HFrEF), remodeling markers at admission and changes in levels of inflammatory markers across the first 24 h were predictive for all-cause mortality and rehospitalization at 60 days (pinteraction <0.05).
3:::Thirty-four patients were accrued. Twenty-four out of 34 LN (70.6%) showed persistent RC after a median follow-up time of 27.6 months (range: 12.0-50.2 months), while ten cases of RF (29.4%) were confirmed with a median time of 6.8 months (range: 1.5-19.5 months). Patients with RC showed significantly lower pre-treatment D values compared to the RF patients (p=0.038). At mid-treatment, the patients with RF showed significantly higher D values (p=0.025), and exhibited larger percent reductions in f and the product D*×f from the baseline (p=0.008 and <0.001, respectively). No additional information was provided by the examination at the end of treatment.
3:::A significant AUC for differentiation between benign and malignant lesions was identified for choline (0.733, P=0.001), olefinic acids (0.769, P=0.0001) and water-to-methylene ratio (0.704, P=0.003). All three variables were included in a classification algorithm using CHAID methodology. Using this classification, 70.8% (17/24) false positive diagnoses in benign lesions would have been avoided. Inter-reader agreement was almost perfect.
3:::The craniocaudal gradients of MPCR in COPD patients were significantly lower than those in normal subjects (right inspiratory phase, 75.5±48.1 vs. 108.9±42.0s(-1)cm(-1), P<0.001; right expiratory phase, 66.4±40.6 vs. 89.8±31.6s(-1)cm(-1), P=0.003; left inspiratory phase, 75.5±48.2 vs. 108.2±47.2s(-1)cm(-1), P=0.002; left expiratory phase, 60.9±38.2 vs. 84.3±29.5s(-1)cm(-1), P=0.002). No significant differences in height, weight, or BMI were observed between COPD and normal groups. In the sub-analysis, the gradients in severe COPD patients (global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease [GOLD] 3 or 4, n=26) were significantly lower than those in mild COPD patients (GOLD 1 or 2, n=17) for both right and left inspiratory/expiratory phases (all P≤0.005).
3:::A recent patient-level meta-analysis was selected for critical appraisal. The study compared the visual recovery rates after IV thrombolysis in CRAO against the natural history of this illness and conservative therapies (ocular massage, anterior chamber paracentesis, and/or hemodilution). Time to thrombolytic therapy administration had a significant impact on visual recovery in CRAO (P<0.001). IV thrombolysis within the first 4.5 hours after symptom onset resulted in recovery of vision in 50.0% of the patients [95% confidence interval (CI), 32.4%-67.6%]. The rate of visual recovery was nearly 3 times higher than in the natural history cohort [odds ratio, 4.7 (95% CI, 2.3-9.6); P<0.001], with a 32.3% absolute risk reduction and a number needed to treat of 4.0 (95% CI, 2.6-6.6). There was no significant difference in the recovery rate after thrombolysis compared with the natural history cohort for those patients treated after 4.5 hours. No major hemorrhages occurred after alteplase administration in this meta-analysis.
3:::Twenty percent (155/783) had COPD. The PPV of overall appearance specific for COPD alone was low (37-55%). Factors in the diagnostic model were age, type of surgery, gender, distance of the right diaphragm apex to the first rib, retrosternal space, sternodiaphragmatic angle, maximum height right diaphragm (lateral view) and subjective impression of COPD (using both views). The model resulted in a PPV of 100%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 82%, sensitivity of 10% and specificity of 100% with an area under the curve of 0.811.
3:::CT values on VMI at 50-130keV (20keV-interval), k, and NIC values were significantly higher in IMCCs than in LAs (p<0.0001). The best single parameter for differentiating IMCC from LA was CT value at 90keV, with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 89.1%, 86.5%, 87.9%, 89.1%, and 86.5%, respectively. The best combination of parameters was CT value at 90keV, k, and NIC, with values of 87.5%, 84.6%, 83.6%, 87.5%, and 84.6%, respectively. Compared with CT value at linear blending images, CT value at 90keV showed greater sensitivity (89.1% vs 60.9%, p<0.0001) and similar specificity (86.5% vs 84.6%, p=1.0000), and combined CT value at 90keV, k, and NIC showed greater sensitivity (87.5% vs 60.9%, p<0.0001) and similar specificity (84.6% vs 84.6%, p=1.0000). Compared with qualitative analysis, CT value at 90keV showed greater sensitivity (89.1% vs 65.6%, p=0.0059) and specificity (86.5% vs 69.2%, p=0.0352), and combined CT value at 90keV, k, and NIC showed greater sensitivity (87.5% vs 65.6%, p=0.0094) and similar specificity (84.6% vs 69.2%, p >0.05).
3:::A total of 12 reports (7 observational studies and 5 abstracts from conferences) involving 255 patients were included in the analysis. The primary sites of melanoma were cutaneous (n=22; 8.6%), ocular (n=197; 77.3%), rectal (n=3; 1.2%), and unknown (n=33; 12.9%). The median disease control rate at 3 months was 73.6% (range, 58.3%-88.9%). Among the 207 patients for whom tumor response at 3 months was reported, complete response was seen in 1.0% (2/207), partial response was seen in 19.3% (40/207), stable disease was seen in 46.9% (97/207), and progressive disease was seen in 32.9% (68/207). The median survival was 10 months (range, 7-13.4 months), and the median 1-year survival rate was 34.6% (range, 23%-80%). Complications of (90)Y radioembolization were reported in 13 cases. The most common side effects were fatigue (median, 36.1%), abdominal pain (median, 17.8%), and nausea (median, 15.0%).
3:::No significant differences in age or gender appeared between groups. On qualitative analysis, T2 dark strands were identified in 90% by both radiologist (K=0.82) of awdt, while fascial tail was identified in 70% by radiologist 1 and 80% by second radiologist (k=0.91) of awdt; however no other lesions showed these findings. Other subjective imaging findings did not significantly differ between groups with moderate-to-strong agreements (k=0.7-1.0). On quantitative measurements, diffusion imaging awdt lesions showed higher mean ADC value compared to other lesions, although it did not reached at the level of significance. While on DCE MRI, all awdt lesions showed type 1 (progressive) DCE curve, however no significant difference was observed between groups.
3:::Univariable analysis identified uniformity (σ0.5), sex, tumour site, nodal stage and carcinoembryonic antigen as potential predictors. Uniformity remained a significant predictor in multivariable analysis to predict early metastases (OR 0.56). None of the parameters could predict intermediate/late metastases.
3:::The FBLC was located at a mean distance of 8.3 mm from the superior cortical of the MF in males and 8.1 mm in females. There was no difference between males and females regarding the mean bone thickness from the MC to the buccal external surface at all the points investigated (p>0.05). Bone thickness from the lingual external surface to the MC was bigger among females than males in regions B and C (p < 0.05). The diameter of the MC was bigger among males in regions B and C.
3:::A total of 1010 patients (mean age = 45 years) participated in Italy. In total, 94% were below retirement age, and of these, 56% were employed. Employment was related to disability, and MS affected productivity at work in 77% of the patients. Overall, 96% and 65% of the patients experienced fatigue and cognitive difficulties as a problem, respectively. Mean utility and total annual costs were 0.735 and €22,900 at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 0-3, 0.534 and €40,100 at EDSS of 4-6.5, and 0.135 and €53,300 at EDSS of 7-9. The mean cost of a relapse was estimated to be €2600.
3:::A total of 1856 patients (mean age: 54 years) participated in Belgium; 66% were below retirement age, and of these, 44% were employed. Employment was related to disease severity, and MS affected productivity at work in 85% of the patients. Overall, 95% and 72% of the patients experienced fatigue and cognitive difficulties, respectively, as a problem. Mean utility and annual costs were 0.703 and €26,400 at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-3, 0.478 and €45,300 at EDSS 4-6.5, and 0.193 and €62,000 at EDSS 7-9. The mean cost of a relapse was estimated to be €3000.
3:::The total error rate was 7.3% with the automated anesthesia carts (1 in 14 administrations) and 11.9% with conventional manual carts (1 in 8 administrations). Automated anesthesia carts significantly reduced the drug recording error rate compared to conventional manual carts (P<0.01). However, no significant difference of substitution or errors omission errors was found between groups of automated anesthesia carts and conventional manual carts. The anesthesiologists compliance with the automated anesthesia carts was unsatisfactory, and all the errors in medication recordings with the automated anesthesia carts were due to the incorrect use of the carts. Most of the participating anesthesiologists preferred the automated anesthesia carts (P<0.05).'
3:::The layout identified using the proposed method improved the distances traveled by noncritical and critical patients by 42.2% and 47.6%, respectively, and minimized the relocation costs.
3:::Overall, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) admissions varied across seasons (P < .01), and were higher in winter (winter vs. spring n = 21,483 vs. 20,291, respectively). When stratified based on type of AMI, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) admissions varied across seasons (P < .01) and were highest in winter and lowest in spring. Seasonal variation was not significant in STEMI admissions (P = .30). Seasonal variation with winter predominance was noted in AMI patients in warmer southern states (P < .01), but not in colder states. The distributions of length of stay for AMI patients and door to balloon times for STEMI patients were minimally different across all four seasons (P < .01) with longest occurring in winter. Most patients with AMI presented during daytime with a peak close to 11 am and a nadir at approximately 4 am.
3:::The 2009 LVDD Recommendations classified 55 patients (12%) as having normal, 132 (29%) as grade 1, 156 (34%) as grade 2, and 117 (25%) as grade 3 DD. Based on 2016 Recommendations, 177 patients (38%) were normal, 50 (11%) were indeterminate, 124 (27%) patients were grade 1, 75 (16%) were grade 2, 26 (6%) were grade 3 DD, and 8 (2%) were cannot determine. The 2016 Recommendations had superior discriminatory accuracy in predicting LVEDP (P<.001) but were not superior in predicting Tau. During median follow-up of 416 days (interquartile range: 5 to 2004 days), 54 patients (12%) died. Significant DD by 2016 Recommendations was associated with higher risk of mortality (P=.039, subdistribution HR1.85 [95% CI, 1.03-3.33]) in multivariable competing risk regression.
3:::A total of 747 patients (mean age 47 years) participated; 86% were below retirement age and of these, 49% were employed. Employment was related to disease severity, and MS affected productivity at work for 82% of those working. Overall, 92% and 66% of patients experienced fatigue and cognitive difficulties as a problem. Mean utility and annual costs were 0.832 and 257,000CZK at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-3, 0.530 and 425,500CZK at EDSS 4-6.5 and 0.141 and 489,000CZK at EDSS 7-9. The average cost of a relapse was estimated at 12,600CZK.
3:::The mean (SD) age was 61.2 (13.7) years, and 31% were women. One out of 4 (26%) participants had HF with preserved ejection fraction. Only 25% of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction received guideline-directed medical therapy at discharge. Cumulative all-cause mortality at 1 year was 30.8% (n = 371), but the greatest risk of mortality was in the first 3 months (18.1%). Most deaths (61%) occurred in patients younger than 70 years. One out of every 3 (30.2%) patients was readmitted at least once over 1 year. The hospital readmission rates were similar between HF with preserved ejection fraction and HF with reduced ejection fraction patients. New York Heart Association functional class IV status and lack of guideline-directed medical treatment after index hospitalization were associated with increased likelihood of readmission. Similarly, older age, lower education status, nonischemic etiology, history of stroke, higher serum creatinine, lack of adherence to guideline-directed medical therapy, and hospital readmissions were associated with increased 1-year mortality.
3:::A total of 411 MS patients (mean age = 40 years) participated in Poland; 94% were below retirement age, and of these, 59% were employed. Employment was related to disability, and MS affected productivity for 85% of those working. Overall, 97% and 71% of patients experienced fatigue and cognition as important problems, respectively. Mean utility and total annual costs were 0.686 and 48,700 PLN at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-3, 0.521 and 59,200 PLN at EDSS 4-6.5 and 0.208 and 81,600 PLN at EDSS 7-9, respectively. The average cost of a relapse was 3,900 PLN.
3:::The study included 130 patients with 287 CPET test pairs. Average age was 26.6±9.5 years. Baseline pVO2 averaged 22.0±5.7 mL/kg/min or 60.9%±13.7% predicted. In the cohort overall, there was no change in mean pVO2 between sequential CPETs. Eleven patients died and 2 underwent transplant. On average, pVO2 declined for patients who subsequently died or underwent transplant but remained stable among those who did not (-9.8%±14.6% vs 0.0±13.0%, P<.01). Those with a decline in pVO2 between CPETs were at greater risk of death or transplantation (per 10% decrease in pVO2: HR=2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.1, P=.004). Change in pVO2 remained a significant predictor of death or transplant after adjusting for pVO2 at first CPET (per 10% decline in pVO2: HR=2.5, 95% CI 1.5-4.2, P<.001).
3:::A total of 208 patients (mean age: 38.5 years) participated in the Russian study; 97% were below retirement age, and of these, 49% were employed. MS was reported to affect productivity at work in 63% of patients. Overall, 87% and 41% of patients felt that fatigue and cognition were a problem. The mean utility and costs were 0.769 and 578,000 RUB at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-3, 0.509 and 826,000 RUB at EDSS 4-6.5, and 0.071 and 1,013,000 RUB at EDSS 7-9. The average cost of a relapse was 33,000 RUB.
3:::Among 403 linked patients, the mean age was 80 years, 60% were male, mean baseline left ventricular ejection fraction was 49.6%, 83.3% were New York Heart Association class III/IV, 78.2% were MR grade 3+/4+, and 63.3% had functional MR. All-cause hospitalization decreased from 1,854 to 1,435/1,000 person-years (P<.001). HF hospitalization decreased following MitraClip (749 vs 332/1000 person-years, P<.001), but bleeding increased (199 vs 298/1000 person-years, P<.001). Changes in stroke and myocardial infarction were not statistically significant. Overall mean Medicare costs per patient were similar pre- and post-MitraClip, although there was a significant decrease in mean costs among those that survived a full year after MitraClip ($18,131 [SD $25,130] vs $11,679 [SD $22,486], P=.02).
3:::With 3,748 patients in the study, we observed rising trends in IE incidence, but no significant difference between pre- and post-guideline. There was a significant trend increase for IE due to viridans group streptococci (VGS) for ages >10 years old, comparing pre-guideline to post-guideline periods, but not in children 0-9 years of age. Neither in-hospital mortality nor length of stay changed significantly during study.
3:::A total of 16,808 patients in 16 countries participated in the study: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
3:::The study included 101 and 21 patients who underwent surgery for UCs and OCs, respectively. Forty percent and 67% of patients who had UCs and OCs, respectively, experienced lymph node metastasis (P = 0.051). Median follow-up time was 12 months (range, 1-158 months) for patients with UCs and 24 months (range 1-154 months) for patients with OCs. Recurrence developed outside the abdomen in 58% of patients with UCs and in 10% of patients with OCs (P = 0.005). Median time to recurrence was 9 months (range 3-58 months) in patients with UCs, whereas it was 18 months (range 11-72 months) in patients with OCs (P = 0.002). Five-year disease-free survival was 34% and 19% for patients with UCs and OCs, respectively (P = 0.90). Five-year overall survival was 56% for patients with UCs and 54% for patients with OCs (P = 0.51).
3:::The simulated emergencies were performed by 119 participants. There was overall high consistency (Cronbachs alpha [95% CI] 0.984 [0.981 to 0.987]) and moderate agreement (intra-class correlation coefficients [95% CI] 0.49 [0.35 to 0.63]) among raters. Significantly higher PETRA scores (mean [standard deviation]) were recorded with ""good"" versus ""poor"" performing teams (real scenarios 3.8 [0.7] vs. 2.9 [0.7]; P < 0.001; acted scenarios 4.7 [0.5] vs. 2.2 [0.7]; P < 0.001), suggesting strong construct validity. The overall PETRA scores were not different between the PPH (3.7 [0.7]) and preeclampsia (3.7 [0.8]) scenarios (P = 0.49). Generalizability coefficients were 0.83 for PPH and 0.76 for preeclampsia.'
3:::Few differences in terms of technical performance were observed between devices. Non-invasive ventilation modes had a huge influence on asynchrony occurrence. Using our global model, either objective tasks completion, psycho-cognitive scales and/or physiological measurements were able to depict significant differences in terms of devices usability. The level of failure that was observed with some devices depicted the lack of adaptation of device's development to end users' requests.'
3:::A total of 721 patients (mean age 48 years) participated in Switzerland; 90% were below retirement age, and of these, 65% were employed. Employment was related to disease severity, and MS affected productivity at work for 69% of patients. Overall, 93% and 64% of patients experienced fatigue and cognition as a problem, respectively. The mean utility and annual costs were 0.799 and 29,600CHF at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-3, 0.614 and 66,800CHF at EDSS 4-6.5 and 0.348 and 110,800CHF at EDSS 7-9, respectively. The mean cost of a relapse was estimated at 7600CHF.
3:::There were positive and statistically significant correlations between N/L ratio and prolonged hospital stay and postoperative antibiotic doses and total antibiotic doses. The optimum cut -off level of N/L ratio was 5.19 according to ROC analysis. However, there was no correlation between MPV and any of these parameters.
3:::Fifteen studies of 76 pediatric patients with AIH were included in the review. Overall response rates at 6 months were estimated as 36% for mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (N = 34, 95% confidence interval [CI] (16-57)), and 50% for tacrolimus (N = 4, 95% CI (0-100%)) and 83% for cyclosporine (N = 15, 95% CI (66%-100%)). Adverse effects were most frequent with cyclosporine (64% experiencing at least 1 adverse effect) followed by tacrolimus (54%) and MMF (48%). Pooled estimates of adverse events were 78% for cyclosporine (95% CI (54%-100%)), 42% for tacrolimus (95% CI (0%-85%)) and 45% for MMF (95% CI (25%-68%)). Sensitivity analyses were not performed due to small sample size.
3:::The literature search identified 57 published case reports that were reviewed for inclusion. Of those published cases, etiologic factors can be classified into idiopathic, acquired, and traumatic causes. Most AVAs are limited to the azygos arch, a congenital anatomic weak point. Clinical symptoms generally remain nonspecific. Computed or magnetic resonance tomography scans are effective diagnostic tools, although the optimal therapeutic plan remains unclear. Complications include rupture, thromboembolism, mediastinal mass effects, and pulmonary artery hypertension.
3:::Seventy patients with gastroparesis and 126 controls were included. Clinically significant endoscopic findings were noted in 35% of controls (44/126) and 43% of gastroparetics (30/70), P = 0.345. Concordance between gross and histologic findings was low at 50%. Histologic findings included gastritis 60% (17/28), esophagitis 39% (11/28), and duodenitis 7% (2/28). In univariate and multivariate analyses, there was no meaningful correlation between symptoms and/or screening laboratory values and diagnosis of gastroparesis.
3:::We revealed the association of genotype G/G with the increased risk of PVVs (odds ratio [OR], 1.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-3.44; P = .04). In the subgroup analysis, association was revealed only in patients with C2 Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology class (allele G: OR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.13-2.33; P = .008]; genotype G/G: OR, 3.22 [95% CI, 1.43-7.27; P = .005]), in patients with age at onset of PVVs before 30 years (allele G: OR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.08-1.85; P = .01]; genotype G/G: OR, 2.35 [95% CI, 1.22-4.55; P = .01]), and in patients who declared no family history (allele G: OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.02-2.09; P = .04]; genotype G/G: OR, 2.50 [95% CI, 1.11-5.63; P = .03]).
3:::Fifty patients were prospectively enrolled. 26/50 (52%) tumor samples were positive for both p16(INK4A) expression and HR-HPV DNA (22 HPV16, 4 HPV33). Seropositivity was present in 26/26 HPV-attributable OPSCC and one p16(INK4A)-positive/HPV DNA-negative case. The sensitivity and specificity to diagnose an HR-HPV-attributable tumor was 100% and 96%, respectively for anti-E6 reactivity, 82% and 100%, respectively for anti-E2 reactivity, and clearly lower for anti-E7, anti-E1, anti-E4 and anti-L1-reactivity. 3yr-overall (OS) and disease specific survival (DSS) was higher in patients with HR-HPV-attributable tumors (OS 88% vs 64%, p=0.02; DSS 90% vs 80%, p=0.07) and seropositive patients (OS 88% vs 62%, p=0.01; DSS 92% vs 78%, p=0.05) than HR-HPV-negative or seronegative patients.
3:::DASH scores initially improved postoperatively but were not statistically significant. Grip strength was 60% of contralateral side. Postoperative range of motion at 6 months was flexion 40.3°, extension 39.3°, supination 87.0°, pronation 77.8°, radial deviation 14.5°, and ulnar deviation 13.8°. A 45% failure rate was observed. Complications included failure with conversion to Total Wrist Arthroplasty (TWA; n = 2) or wrist fusion (n = 3) secondary to development of ulnar-sided wrist pain. One additional patient experienced severe wrist pain but declined additional surgery.
3:::There were lymph node metastasis in 50.1% of the neck dissections. The pathological record revealed ECS in 50.5% of the positive neck dissections. The implementation of the changes of the 8th edition TNM classification produced the upstaging of 20.9% of the patients classified as pN1 with the 7th edition TNM classification to pN2a¸ and the upstaging of 58.4% of the patients classified as pN2 with the 7th edition TNM classification to pN3b. We conducted an objective comparison of the quality of both classifications. The 8th TNM classification edition achieved better results regarding both the discrimination in cause-specific survival between pN categories and in the distribution in the number of cases between categories than the 7th edition TNM classification.
3:::At median follow-up of 54months, 5 patients failed regionally and 4 emerged with a primary (tongue base, hypopharynx and thoracic esophagus). Five-year rates of regional control, primary emergence, distant metastasis, disease-free survival and overall survival were 90%, 10%, 20%, 72% and 79%, respectively. The 5year rate of primary emergence in a non-oropharynx site was 3%.
3:::A total of 110 infusions were given to 54 patients. Compared with baseline preinfusion hemoglobin (Hb; 9.2 ± 1.9 g/dL), a significant rise was seen at 1 week and 4 weeks postinfusion (11.5 ± 1.5 and 11.8 ± 1.7 g/dL, respectively, P < 0.001). Also, a significant rise in serum ferritin at 1 week and 4 weeks postinfusion was seen (51 ± 71 vs 192 ± 148 and 89 ± 135 ng/mL, P < 0.001 and <0.035, respectively). Patients who concomitantly received erythropoietin had a significantly larger Hb rise from baseline than those who did not at 4 weeks (2.7 ± 2.2 vs 1.6 ± 1.1 g/dL, P < 0.017). ADRs included pruritus (n = 1), urticaria (n = 1), and multisymptom episodes (n = 3) that included shortness of breath, chest tightness, back pain, and epigastric cramping that responded to therapy with IV diphenhydramine and methylprednisolone.
3:::Bridge clinic patients were at higher baseline risk of readmission and death; other characteristics were similar. 90-day death and all-cause readmission trended lower in bridge clinic patients (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.64; 95% CI = 0.40-1.02; P = 0.06). Time to first follow-up was shorter in bridge clinic patients (11 ± 6 vs 20 ± 23 days; P < 0.001); time to first all-cause readmission trended longer (40 ± 20 vs 33 ± 25days; P = 0.11). 30-day death and all-cause readmission was significantly lower in bridge clinic patients (adjusted HR = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.22-0.88; P = 0.02).
3:::The postoperative complication rate was 1.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3%-2.5%). Postoperative infection rate was 1.6% and surgical complication rate was 0.3%. Median adjusted standardized cost was $4112.5 (interquartile range: $2979-$6049). Patients with more than 1 diagnosis had 19 times higher risk of complications and were associated with 13% more hospital cost than those with syndactyly as single diagnosis ( P < .001). Finally, there was a wide variation in cost across hospitals; 8 (21%) yielded confidence limits above the benchmarked value.
3:::The differences of RMSTs (DPP-4 inhibitors minus placebo) for hospitalization for heart failure were -4 days [-6, -2] in the SAVOR-TIMI 53 (720 days follow-up), -3 days [-9, 3] in the EXAMINE (900 days follow-up), and 1 day [-5, 7] in the TECOS (1440 days follow-up). There were no substantial differences in the risk of other cardiovascular outcomes between DPP-4 inhibitors and placebo.
3:::An approximate 50-fold variation in the point estimate was observed between the serotypes having the highest (7F, 38, 19A, 3, 33F) and the lowest (6C, 35B, 21, 11A, 23B and 23A) computed serotype specific invasive disease potential. In the post-PCV13 era (6C, 35B, 11A, 23B and 23A), 5 of the 7 most common serotypes colonizing the nasopharynx were serotypes with the lowest invasive capacity. Serotype specific invasive capacity trended down in older children for majority of the serotypes, and serotypes 3, 10A and 19A had significantly lower invasive capacity in children older than 24months of age compared to younger children.
3:::When stored at 2-8 °C and between -15 and -25 °C, at least 90% of the initial tacrolimus concentration remained throughout the 85-day study period. There were no significant differences in tacrolimus concentrations between the starting and ending points (p > 0.05). However, when tacrolimus solution was stored at 25 °C, the percentage of the initial tacrolimus concentration remaining had decreased to less than 90% on day 28.
3:::Curcumin could promote injury-induced cell autophagy, remyelination and axon regeneration in sciatic nerve of rats. In vitro, curcumin could accelerate cell autophagy through regulating autophagy related Erk1/2 and Akt pathway, prevent cell apoptosis and promote expression of PMP22 and S100, and reduced deposition of Fibrin in cultured RSC96 SCs.
3:::The search yielded 122 independent studies with 1,155 comparisons. Estimated effect sizes tended to be small to medium but varied substantially across stimuli and ROIs. Overall, nonsocial ROIs yielded larger effect sizes than social ROIs; however, eye and whole-face regions from stimuli with human interaction produced the largest effects (Hedges g = 0.47 and 0.50, respectively). Studies with weaker study designs or reporting yielded larger effects, but key effects remained significant and medium in size, even for high-rigor designs.
3:::A dose-response association was observed between higher NS and the odds of psychotic experiences at 13 years (medium NS, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.25, 95% CI 1.05-1.49; high NS, aOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.30-2.40), whereas high levels of ND predicted psychotic experiences at 18 years (aOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.10-2.07). High levels of NC (aOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.02-1.71) and NS (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.07-2.26) were associated with increased odds of high depressive symptoms at 18 years in a dose-response fashion.
3:::Significant treatment effects on the primary outcome were limited to parent ratings for the adolescent subgroup (posttreatment: -8.3; 95% CI = -14.2 to -1.9; p = .012, effect size [ES] = 0.32; follow-up: -8.6; 95% CI = -15.4 to -1.8; p = .015, ES = 0.33) and females (posttreatment: -8.9; 95% CI = -16.2 to -1.6; p = .019, ES = 0.40). Secondary outcomes indicated moderate effects on adaptive functioning and clinical severity.
3:::Task-related activation in right caudate nucleus was predicted by an interaction of clinical responses to methylphenidate and atomoxetine (F1,30 = 17.00; p < .001). Elevated caudate activation was associated with robust improvement for methylphenidate and little improvement for atomoxetine. The rate of robust response was higher for methylphenidate than for atomoxetine in youth with high (94.4% vs. 38.8%; p = .003; number needed to treat = 2, 95% CI = 1.31-3.73) but not low (33.3% vs. 50.0%; p = .375) caudate activation. Furthermore, response to atomoxetine predicted motor cortex activation (F1,30 = 14.99; p < .001).
3:::Propofol increased cell death in neurons by 1.8-fold (% of PI-positive cells [PI%] = 18.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15.2-21.9, P < .05) but did not influence astrocyte viability. The neuronal death was attenuated by a high ANR (1:1 cocultures; fold change [FC] = 1.17, 95% CI, 0.96-1.38, P < .05), but not with a low ANR [1:9 cocultures; FC = 1.87, 95% CI, 1.48-2.26, P > .05]). Astrocytes secreted BDNF in a cell density-dependent way and propofol decreased BDNF secretion from astrocytes. Administration of BDNF, CHIR99021, or Mdivi-1 significantly attenuated the propofol-induced neuronal death and aberrant mitochondria in neuron-alone cultures (FC = 0.8, 95% CI, 0.62-0.98; FC = 1.22, 95% CI, 1.11-1.32; FC = 1.35, 95% CI, 1.16-1.54, respectively, P < .05) and the cocultures with a low ANR (1:9; FC = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.74-0.97; FC = 1.08, 95% CI, 0.84-1.32; FC = 1.25, 95% CI, 1.1-1.39, respectively, P < .05). Blocking BDNF receptor or protein kinase B activity abolished astrocyte-induced neuroprotection in the cocultures with a high ANR (1:1).
3:::Nanoparticles were stable and nontoxic. Upon administration in colitic mice, anti-MAdCAM-1 functionalized nanoparticles preferentially localized in the inflamed bowel, whereas untargeted nanoparticles were more rapidly washed out. Nanoparticles did not induce lesions in nontarget organs.
3:::From July 2010 to November 2013, 36 eligible patients with nonmetastatic stage III-IVb NPC were enrolled. The objective response rates were 97.2% (eight complete responses [CRs] and 27 partial responses [PRs]) and 100% (30 CRs and six PRs) after two cycles of induction chemotherapy (ICT) and CCRT, respectively. With a median follow-up time of 45months, the estimated 3-year progression-free survival and cancer-specific survival were 86.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.8-99.8%) and 91.7% (95% CI, 68.9-100.0%), respectively. The most frequent grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (8.6%) and nausea (8.6%) after ICT and thrombocytopenia (34.3%) and leukopenia (28.6%) after CCRT.
3:::Design quality of physical healthcare environments involves three different themes: (i) environmental sustainability and ecological values, (ii) social and cultural interactions and values, and (iii) resilience of the engineering and building construction. Design quality was clarified herein with a definition.
3:::There was a significant positive relationship between clinical flexibility and both Ravg (p = .041) and αtot (p = .042) adjusting for skeletal age, height, body mass index, and paraspinous muscle area as covariates. The ratio was significantly higher (Ravg = 0.45 vs. 0.38, p < .0001) and the bending angle was significantly greater (αtot = 107° vs. 89°, p < .0001) for girls with scoliosis compared with controls.
3:::There were 78 patients: 31 MAC and 47 WALANT. The MAC group averaged 27.2 minutes of OR time; the WALANT group averaged 25.2 minutes. The MAC group surgical time was 10.2 minutes versus WALANT of 10.4 minutes. Post-operatively, the MAC group averaged 72.3 minutes in the recovery room compared with WALANT group of 30.2 minutes. Each case performed under MAC had a minimum of excess charges from anesthesia of approximately $105.
3:::A total of 6602 tests demonstrated mannitol recovery, lactulose recovery, and the L:M ratio were associated with country, sex, and age. There was heterogeneity in the recovery of both probes between sites with mean mannitol recovery ranging for 1.34% to 5.88%, lactulose recovery of 0.19% to 0.58%, and L:M ratios 0.10 to 0.17 in boys of 3 months of age across different sites. We observed strong sex-specific differences in both mannitol and lactulose recovery, with boys having higher recovery of both probes. Alterations in intestinal barrier function increased in most sites from 3 to 9 months of age and plateaued or diminished from 9 to 15 months of age.
3:::The procedure succeeded in all 16 patients. During follow-up (mean, 12 months; range, 3-36 months), access failure due to thrombosis was observed in one patient. The remaining continued to function well until the end of the follow-up period or until the death of the patient (n = 3). No pneumothorax occurred. The most common complication was mediastinal hematoma after puncture failure in five patients. The diameter of the maximum hematoma was 2.2 cm, and all resolved spontaneously.
3:::EVTA of the great saphenous vein (n = 146), small saphenous vein (n = 20), or both (n = 7) was performed on 173 limbs with active (n = 72) or healed (n = 101) ulcers. Deep venous insufficiency was present in 54 cases (31.2%). Concomitant phlebectomy was performed in 59 limbs (34%). Median follow-up time was 25.2 months after EVTA. Venous ulcers healed after EVTA in 57% of cases at 3 months, 74% at 6 months, and 78% at 12 months. Ulcers recurred in 9% of patients at 1 year after EVTA, 20% at 2 years, and 29% at 3 years of follow-up. Ulcers recurred significantly more often in patients with deep venous insufficiency and in patients who did not undergo phlebectomy of associated varicose veins at the time of EVTA.
3:::During a median (interquartile range) follow-up duration of 51 (41-68) days, complete vein occlusion was achieved in 98.4% of 438 EVLA procedures in 306 patients. One patient had an EHIT level 2 (0.2%; 95% confidence interval, 0.006%-1.3%). No major bleedings (0%; 95% confidence interval, 0.0%-0.8%) and six minor bleedings (1.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5%-3%) were observed.
3:::Positive FLG and negative POSTN staining were observed in all esophageal biopsies from normal controls. In contrast, FLG and POSTN stained negative and positive, respectively, in all pretreatment biopsies obtained from patients with EoE, whereas FLG and POSTN stained positive in 57.1% and 95.2% of GERD cases, respectively (P < 0.001). A statistically significant decrease of the proportion of cases with negative FLG and positive POSTN staining was observed from the first (pretreatment) to the second (post-treatment) biopsy in the subgroup of patients with EoE (P < 0.001 in both correlations).
3:::Overall, 35% of cases were biopsied according to the 2006 American Gastroenterological Association guidelines for CD diagnosis; 8% were biopsied according to the 2007 American Gastroenterological Association EoE consensus recommendations. Detection of CD and EoE increased with the number of biopsies collected (P for trend in each <0.001). Adherence to diagnostic guidelines was particularly poor among those found to have histologically normal mucosa in both cohorts. The likelihood of CD and EoE diagnosis was significantly associated with adherence to diagnostic guidelines (odds ratio for CD 6.3, 95% confidence interval 4.4-8.9; odds ratio for EoE 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.9-2.9).
3:::Seventy-four limbs in 70 patients who underwent iliac vein stenting for ICVO were identified; 36 limbs (48.6%) were stented for nonthrombotic venous compression (stent-VC), and 38 limbs (51.4%) were stented for venous thrombosis (stent-VT). Twenty-seven limbs (71.1%) of the stent-VT group were treated for acute venous thrombosis requiring lysis followed by stenting for underlying venous lesions. The median number of follow-up visits for the stent-VC and stent-VT groups was two (interquartile range [IQR], 1-4) and two (IQR, 1-3), whereas the mean length of follow-up was 19.6 ± 29.5 months and 19.8 ± 26.5 months (P = .972), respectively. During the first 6 months, one limb (2.8% [n = 36]) in the stent-VC group occluded, whereas 13.2% (5/38) of the limbs in the stent-VT group occluded. In the stent-VT group, 57% of limbs (4 of 7) with acute venous thrombosis requiring thrombolytic therapy had limb occlusion at >6 months (median, 18.1 months; IQR, 16.6-30.1). Overall patency rates for the stent-VC and stent-VT groups were 97.2% (1/36) and 73.7% (10/38) at 36 months (standard error, ≤10%; P = .001), respectively.
3:::The mean age of the patients was 44.05 ± 6.31 years. Twenty-two patients (57.9%) had a history of uterine leiomyoma. Nine patients (23.7%) had a history of IVL without IVCE or ICE. The most common symptoms were chest tightness (seven patients), lower limb swelling (five patients), palpitation (four patients), dizziness (two patients), and abdominal distention (two patients). Preoperative diagnoses were achieved in 28 patients (73.7%); 23 patients (60.5%) underwent one-stage surgery, whereas 15 (39.5%) underwent two-stage surgery. Eighteen patients (72%) received postoperative antiestrogen hormone therapy. Regular follow-up was available in 30 patients, with a median follow-up time of 12.0 months; 15 patients (50.0%) showed evidence of recurrence. Factors such as postoperative antiestrogen hormone therapy (9/20 compared with 6/10; P = .601), duration of postoperative hormonal therapy (10/15 in >6 months compared with 5/15 in ≤6 months; P = .862), and heart involvement (10/22 compared with 5/8; P = .669) were not significantly associated with recurrence.
3:::A total of 737 patients with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease or skin biopsy-confirmed dermatitis herpetiformis were included. Patients lost to follow-up, or with insufficient data were excluded leaving 328 patients (157 pediatrics younger than 18 years). For pediatrics, the female to male ratio was 2:1 and the mean age at diagnosis was 8.9 years. For adults, 4:1 and 40.6 years old. Extraintestinal symptom rates were similar in children (60%) and adults (62%). Short stature (33%), fatigue (28%), and headache (20%) were most common in children. Iron deficiency anemia (48%), fatigue (37%), and headache/psychiatric disorders (24%) were common in adults. Children had faster/higher rates of symptom resolution compared with adults. Twenty-eight percent of children with unresolved short stature on a GFD were found to have other comorbidities.
3:::Within placental villi, ADAM28 mRNA levels were highest in HLA-G(+) column trophoblasts, and consistent with this, ADAM28 was preferentially localized to HLA-G(+) trophoblasts within distal anchoring columns and decidual tissue. siRNA-directed loss of ADAM28 impaired trophoblast column outgrowth and resulted in increased apoptosis in matrix-invading trophoblasts.
3:::A total of 397 participants responded to the survey. Mean age was 32.5 years with males comprising 85%. No significant differences in demographics or climbing behaviors were found between males and females. Ninety percent of participants reported sustaining an upper extremity injury. Fingers were the most common injury followed by shoulder/arm and elbow/forearm. Our study found females to be more likely to report a rock climbing-related injury, and more likely to undergo surgery for it.
3:::Initially the trophoblast extended over a rather broad but shallow area, enclosing maternal blood spaces. After expansion of the exocoelom it became covered by somatic mesoderm. The mature chorioallantoic placenta was haemochorial and characterized by a labyrinth with markedly dilated maternal blood spaces. Blood vessels appeared in the splanchnopleure early in development and later extended to the yolk sac, but we found no evidence of a choriovitelline placenta at any stage of gestation. There was, however, an extensive paraplacenta.
3:::There were 15 male and 3 females, average age of 42 years. Two-handed sports such as golf and baseball accounted for more than 60% of the cases, and these cases were the only ones that involved the lead nondominant hand, pain predominantly at impact. Delay in diagnosis averaged greater than 7 months, with triangular fibrocartilage (TFCC) and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) accounting for more than 50% of misdiagnoses. Physical findings of note included pain over the TH joint, worse with passive dorsiflexion and ulnar deviation. Radiographic findings are described. Instillation of lidocaine with the wrist in radial deviation under fluoroscopic imaging with relief of pain helped to confirm the diagnosis. Conservative treatment was successful in 9 of 18 patients (50%), whereas in the remaining, surgical intervention allowed approximately 80% return to full activities without limitation.
3:::We uncovered sub-sets of genes that regulate response to stress, induction of apoptosis programmed cell death, mis-regulation of cell growth, proliferation, cell morphogenesis, tissue viability, and protection from apoptosis in cultured placental explants. We also identified a sub-set of genes with highly unstable pattern of expression after exposure to tissue culture. Tissue culture irrespective of oxygen concentration induced dichotomous increase in significant gene expression and increased enrichment of significant pathways and transcription factor targets (TFTs) including HIF1A. The effect was exacerbated by culture at atmospheric oxygen concentration, where further up-regulation of TFTs including PPARA, CEBPD, HOXA9 and down-regulated TFTs such as JUND/FOS suggest intrinsic heightened key biological and metabolic mechanisms such as glucose use, lipid biosynthesis, protein metabolism; apoptosis, inflammatory responses; and diminished trophoblast proliferation, differentiation, invasion, regeneration, and viability.
3:::Over ten years, rotavirus vaccination would prevent 4000 deaths, nearly 500,000 hospitalizations and 3 million outpatient visits in the base scenario. With a Gavi subsidy, cost/disability adjusted life year (DALY) ratios ranged from $58/DALY to $142/DALY averted. Without a Gavi subsidy and a vaccine price of $2.19 per dose, cost/DALY ratios ranged from $615/DALY to $1514/DALY averted.
3:::The preoperative curve was 61 degrees for SGGS and 65 degrees for GR (NS). After index surgery, the major curve decreased to 24 degrees (-37 degrees) for SGGS and 38 (-27 degrees) for GR (p < .05). At last follow-up, the major curve was 34 degrees (44%) for SGGS and 36 degrees (45%) for GR (NS). The initial T1-T12 length for SGGS was 188 mm and for GR, 181 mm; at last follow-up, SGGS was 234 mm (46 mm increase) and GR was 233 mm (52 mm increase) (NS).
3:::A total of 96 ASD patients were identified, and 63 met the studys inclusion criteria of circumferential MIS or posterior MIS only, with four or more levels instrumented (n: Group 0 = 37, Group + = 15, and Group ++ = 11). Group 0 was younger than ++ (56.8 vs. 69.6 years), with a higher proportion of females than Group + or ++ (83.8% vs. 66.7% and 54.5%, respectively). Baseline HRQoL was similar. Postoperatively, Groups 0 and + had improved Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and numeric rating scale (NRS) back and leg scores. Group ++ only had improvement in NRS scores. At the latest follow-up, Groups 0 and ++ had similar sagittal measurements except for PT (21.6 vs. 23.6, p = .009). The + group had improvement in PI-LL (24.2 to 17; p = .015) and LL (30.9 to 38.3; p = .013). Eight of 27 (21.6%) Group 0 patients deteriorated (4 to Group +, 4 to Group ++). Three of 15 (20.0%) Group + patients deteriorated to Group ++, and 3 improved to Group 0. Six of 11 (54.5%) Group ++ patients improved (3 to Group + and 3 to Group 0).'
3:::Of 738 African American patients with AIS, 223 were assessed for surgical risk factors, and 72 were assessed for curve progression risk factors. Fifty-six (29.17%) had progression of the major coronal curve, and 38 (17.04%) underwent surgery. Age at presentation and curve magnitude at presentation were significant risk factors for surgical intervention. Curve magnitude at presentation was a significant risk factor for curve progression. No significant relationships were found for gender or curve type as they relate to surgical intervention or curve progression.
3:::In total we included 58 studies with a total of 6105 participants. The methodological quality was difficult to assess as it was poorly reported in 35 included studies (three or more domains were rated as unclear risk of bias). Two trials of sevoflurane showed a statistically significant reduction in death within 180 to 365days of surgery (on-pump) (RR 4.10, 95% CI 1.42 to 11.79; p=0.009; I(2)=not applicable; high quality of evidence). There was also a statistically significant difference favouring sevoflurane compared to propofol on both inotropic (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.90; p<0.00001; I(2)=0%) and vasoconstrictor support needed (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.22; p=0.03; I(2)=0%) after coronary artery bypass grafting on-pump. Two trials of sevoflurane (MD -0.22, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.03; p=0.02; I(2)=0%) and two further trials of desflurane (MD -0.33, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.20; p<0.00001; I(2)=82%) showed a statistically significant difference on cardiac index during and after coronary artery bypass grafting on-pump, respectively.
3:::The study demonstrates the versatility of thiolated chitosan-based hydrogels for delivering proteins. The effect of various parameters of the hydrogel on protein release kinetics and mechanism of protein release was studied using the Korsmeyer-Peppas release model. Furthermore, we have studied the stability of released proteins in detail while comparing it with non-entrapped proteins under physiological conditions to understand the effect of formulation conditions on protein stability.
3:::The patients mean age was 68.7 years (81.6% men). The periprocedural complication rates across the 3 categories of statin use were 12.0%, 4.5%, and 1.2%. After adjustment, a change in the atorvastatin dose category was associated with reduction in the odds of periprocedural complications for each change in dose category (standard-dose statin: odds ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.81; high-dose statin: odds ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.96; P for trend=0.01). Administration of antiplatelet drugs was also an independent factor in periprocedural complications (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.05-0.69).'
3:::The mean number of affected PVs per patient was 2.7 ± 1.1. Sutureless repair was used in 21 patients (70%), endovenectomy was used in 5 patients, and patch venoplasty was used in 4 patients. Overall PV restenosis, reoperation, and mortality occurred in 50%, 40%, and 30% of patients respectively. Freedom from mortality, reoperation, and restenosis at 8 years of follow-up was 70% ± 8%, 62% ± 8%, and 47% ± 9%, respectively. Restenosis and mortality rates after sutureless repair versus nonsutureless repair were 57% (n = 12 of 21) versus 33% (n = 3 of 9) (p = 0.42) for restenosis and 38% (n = 8 of 21) versus 11% (n = 1 of 9) (p = 0.21) for mortality. Patients selected for a sutureless technique were younger and smaller and had more severe disease before operation. A postoperative high PVS score and pulmonary hypertension 1 month after the operation were independent risk factors for restenosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.34; p = 0.002 and HR, 6.81; p = 0.02, respectively), reoperation (HR, 1.24; p = 0.01 and HR, 7.60; p = 0.02), and mortality (HR, 1.39; p = 0.01 and HR, 39.5; p = 0.008).
3:::In all patients with RH, no statistical differences were found in mortality, severe cardiovascular events rate, and changes in 24-h SBP and office SBP at 6 and 12 months. However, subgroup analyses showed significant differences between the RDN and control groups. In the subpopulations with baseline 24-h SBP ≥155 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) and the infrequently changed medication, the use of RDN resulted in a significant reduction in 24-h SBP level at 6 months (P = 0.100 and P= 0.009, respectively). Subgrouping RCTs with a higher prevalent CHD in control showed that the control treatment was significantly better than RDN in office SBP reduction at 6 months (P < 0.001).
3:::From age 2 to 16 years, the average widths of the SI joint and pubic symphysis decreased from 3.11 to 1.80 mm and 5.55 to 3.69 mm, respectively. The average widths of the 3 limbs of the triradiate cartilage also slightly decreased from age 2 until closure: ilioischial, iliopubic, and ischiopubic cartilages decreasing from 3.72 to 2.74 mm, 4.42 to 3.52 mm, and 3.08 to 2.97 mm, respectively.
3:::Forty-seven patients were reported in 27 studies. We found that GS has a nationwide distribution and that most cases (83%) have been described on the mainland of China. The initial clinical presentation is varied, ranging from symptoms related to the thymoma to infections resulting from immunodeficiency. Type AB (50%) is the most common histologic type of thymomas in Chinese GS patients according to the World Health Organization classification of thymomas. With respect to infection, sinopulmonary infection (74%) is the most common type, followed by skin infection (10%) and intestinal tract infection (10%). Diarrhea was presented in 36% of patients, and autoimmune manifestations were presented in 36% of patients.
3:::Individuals with MCI performed worse on speed and accuracy measures of IADLs in comparison to cognitively normal peers and demonstrated significantly steeper rates of decline over three years in either speed or accuracy in all domains assessed.
3:::A 34-year-old female with true AVF aneurysm presented with hand steal syndrome confirmed by noninvasive studies. The patient underwent a successful vein aneurysmorrhaphy with a commercially available stapler device and duplex ultrasound flow-calibrated banding. At 1-year follow-up, she remains pain free and the fistula remains functional with no recurrence of venous aneurysmal degeneration.
3:::Two hundred ninety-three patients were included for review. Patients with OTA 41-C fractures were more likely to have an associated TE compared with 41-B fractures (63% vs. 28%, P < 0.01). At 3 months postoperatively, the +TE cohort was noted to have worse knee ROM (75.16 ± 51 vs. 86.82 ± 53 degree, P = 0.06). At 6 months, total SMFA and knee ROM was significantly worse in the +TE cohort (29 ± 17 vs. 21 ± 18, P ≤ 0.01; 115.6 ± 20 vs. 124.1 ± 15, P = 0.01). By 12 months postoperatively, only knee ROM remained significantly worse in the +TE cohort (118.7 ± 15 vs. 126.9 ± 13, P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that tibial eminence involvement was a significant predictor of ROM at 6 and 12 months and SFMA at 6 months. Body mass index was found to be a significant predictor of ROM and age was a significant predictor of total SMFA at all time points.
3:::TXA reduced mean incidence of transfusion by 305 mL (P = 0.0005). There was a trend toward decreased transfusion rate in the TXA group (17% vs. 26%, P = 0.22). TXA was safe with no differences in adverse events at 30 and 90 days.
3:::According to MRI, seven plaques were vulnerable, 12 were nonvulnerable without neovascularity, and 12 were nonvulnerable with neovascularity (a precursor of vulnerability). The two parameters cumulated axial translation and the ratio of cumulated axial strain to cumulated axial translation could discriminate between nonvulnerable plaques and vulnerable plaques or determine the presence of neovascularity in nonvulnerable plaques (which was also possible with the mean shear strain parameter). All parameters differed between the non-vulnerable plaque group and the group that combined vulnerable plaques and plaques with neovascularity. The most discriminating parameter for the detection of vulnerable neovascularized plaques was the ratio of cumulated axial strain to cumulated axial translation (expressed as percentage per millimeter) (mean ratio, 39.30%/mm ± 12.80%/mm for nonvulnerable plaques without neovascularity vs 63.79%/mm ± 17.59%/mm for vulnerable plaques and nonvulnerable plaques with neovascularity, p = 0.002), giving an AUC value of 0.886.
3:::The area of calcified nodules in the LIPUS-treated group was significantly greater than in the control group. The expression of Wnt was significantly elevated by LIPUS exposure. Markers associated with endochondral ossification were increased in the LIPUS-treated group. When sclerostin was added to the culture media, calcified nodule formation and the expression of Wnt were inhibited in both the LIPUS-treated group and the control group.
3:::In group L, the lateral hinge formed a union at 3 months postoperatively in 11 knees (84.6%). At 6 months, gap filling in 10 knees (76.9%) reached to zone 2. In group C, while the lateral hinge formed a union at 3 months postoperatively in all cases. At 6 months, gap filling in 6 knees (46.1%) reached to zone 2. The progression of gap filling were 8.5%, 18.9%, and 32.9% (at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery, respectively) in group L, while the progress levels at the same time points were 7.7%, 16.6%, and 24.4% in group C. There were significant differences at 6 months after surgery between the 2 groups.
3:::The duration of use was longer in the non-compliant group compared with that in the compliant group (mean ± SD: 160 ± 118 days vs. 126 ± 81 days; P = 0.01), and the mean age was younger in the non-compliant group (42 ± 20 years vs. 50 ± 21 years; P = 0.002). Additionally, there was a higher ratio of females/males in the compliant group (60/49 vs. 120/50; P = 0.008). However, the side of the fracture was not significantly different between the groups (P = 0.449). Fractures of the forearm were more frequent in the non-compliant group than that in the compliant group (25/170 vs. 7/109; P = 0.003).
3:::The responsive and non-responsive groups consisted of 12 and 5 patients, respectively, and included only male patients. The average age was 13 and 16 years old in the responsive and non-responsive groups, respectively. Epiphyseal closure was present in 1 of the 12 patients in the responsive group and 3 of the 5 patients in the non-responsive group. The Saupe classifications in the responsive and in the non-responsive groups, respectively, were type I in 1 and 2 patients (3 total), type II in 6 and 1 patients (7 total), and type III in 4 and 3 patients (7 total). Bone union was achieved in 10 patients in the responsive group, whereas no patient achieved bone union and 3 patients underwent excision in the non-responsive group. Conservative treatment in the responsive and non-responsive groups, respectively, included prohibition of exercise for 7 and 2 patients (9 total) and instruction on quadriceps femoris muscle stretch for 5 and 2 patients (7 total). In addition, all of the 8 patients wearing an orthosis and 2 patients treated with LIPUS were in the responsive group.
3:::Over a 3-week period, a total of 2585 consecutive ACS patients have been enrolled in 203 cardiac care units across Italy. Among these patients, 1755 underwent PCI (923 with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and 832 with non-ST-elevation ACS). In the catheterization laboratory, unfractioned heparin was the most used antithrombotic drug in both ST-elevation myocardial infarction (64.7%) and non-ST-elevation ACS (77.5%) undergoing PCI and, as aspirin, bivalirudin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs) more frequently employed before or during PCI compared with the postprocedural period. Any crossover of heparin therapy occurred in 36.0% of cases, whereas switching from one P2Y12 inhibitor to another occurred in 3.7% of patients. Multivariable analysis yielded several independent predictors of GPIs and of bivalirudin use in the catheterization laboratory, mainly related to clinical presentation, PCI complexity and presence of complications during the procedure.
3:::The average age of the patients was 7 years (range 1-13 years). Seventeen were males and 13 were females. The Torode and Zieg classification included 3 type I, 6 type II, 13 type III, and 8 type IV. The Kappa value for interobserver agreement comparing radiographs was 0.453, and for CT was 0.42. Three patients (10%) were treated with a spica cast, and none required surgery for their pelvic fracture. Four patients (11%) demonstrated liver, spleen, or kidney injuries on CT. Out of those 4, 1 had indications for laparotomy and drain placement, 1 died secondary to shock, and 2 were treated conservatively.
3:::Graded balloon deflation resulted in variable initial return of aortic flow (median, 78 seconds; interquartile range [IQR], 68-105 seconds). A rapid increase in aortic flow during a single-balloon deflation step was observed in all animals (median, 819 mL/min; IQR, 664-1241 mL/min) and corresponded with an immediate decrease in proximal MAP (median, 30 mm Hg; IQR, 14.5-37 mm Hg). Total balloon volume and time to return of flow demonstrated no correlation (r = 0.016).
3:::Postoperative CT images between 18 symptomatic and 13 asymptomatic patients were compared. On axial views, the symptomatic patients demonstrated greater areas of bone growth at the disk level (164.0±92.4 vs. 77.0±104.9 mm), and lateral recess (69.6±70.5 and 5.9±12.5 mm) as well as in the total cross-sectional area (290.3±162.1 vs. 119.4±115.6 mm). On sagittal imaging, the mean bone growth at the subarticular level (148.7±185.1 vs. 35.8±37.4 mm) and the total cross-sectional area (298.4±324.4 vs. 85.8±76.3 mm) were greater in symptomatic patients (P<0.01). Amount of BMP utilized and operative levels were no different between cohorts.
3:::The associations between earthquake exposure and major depression were explained largely by the experience of peri-traumatic stress during the earthquakes (β = 0.180, p < 0.01) and not by disruption distress following the earthquakes (β = 0.048, p = 0.47).
3:::Patients consisted of a total of 134 program completers (72 males, 62 females; mean age = 67.8 years). Significant improvements in functional performance with regard to 6MWT scores were observed across all groups postintervention (P < .05). The Present group, in both the anxiety and depression domains, failed to reach a minimally clinically important difference postintervention. The Probable and Present groups achieved a significant improvement in CAT scores postintervention (P < .05).
3:::All but one participant had a history of migration, and maps of migration ranges revealed wide geographic dispersal. Most described living and work conditions that could contribute to the spread of drug-resistant TB, including numerous contacts and crowded living quarters.
3:::A total of 142 (77 upregulated and 65 downregulated) transcripts were found to exhibit statistically significant difference between the HIF-1α-KO and WT mice. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that DEGs included genes involved in ""skeletal muscle cell differentiation,"" ""muscle organ development,"" ""glucose metabolic process,"" ""glycogen biosynthetic and metabolic process,"" etc.
3:::A total of 283 out of 389 (72.7%) critical care providers agreed to participate. The same team of physicians attended both ICU and SDU, and severe burnout was identified in 18.2% of them. Considering all others critical care providers of both units, we identified that overall 23.1% (95% CI 18.0-28.8%) presented severe burnout, and it did not differ between professional categories. The mean MDS-R rate for all ICU and SDU respondents was 111.5 and 104.5, respectively, p = 0.446. Many questions from MDS-R questionnaire were significantly associated with burnout, and those respondents with high MDS-R score (>100 points) were more likely to suffer from burnout (28.9 vs 14.4%, p = 0.010). After regression analysis, moral distress was independently associated with burnout (OR 2.4, CI 1.19-4.82, p = 0.014).
3:::The reported incidence of TD seems to be reduced with the use of atypical antipsychotic drugs, yet the risk of developing TD remains with these medications. Furthermore, several other medication classes have a high prevalence of TD and yet are not commonly considered to be TD-inducing. This review highlights the need for a prevention-based focus of TD treatment that starts with a clinical consideration of pharmacologic choices related to each individual patients history.'
3:::No statistically significant differences in any baseline demographic variables were found for either sex between the group taking immunomodulators/biologic agents and the nontreatment group. Among females and males, individual question responses, domain scores, and total scores showed no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment groups.
3:::K-means clustering, which identified patterns of metabolite levels across ancestry groups, demonstrated that, at both fasting and 1-h, levels of the majority of metabolites were similar across ancestry groups. Meta-analyses demonstrated association of a broad array of fasting and 1-h metabolites, including lipids and amino acids and their metabolites, with maternal BMI, glucose levels, and insulin sensitivity before and after adjustment for the different phenotypes. At fasting and 1 h, a mix of metabolites was identified that were common across phenotypes or associated with only one or two phenotypes. Partial correlation estimates, which allowed comparison of the strength of association of different metabolites with maternal phenotypes, demonstrated that metabolites most strongly associated with different phenotypes included some that were common across as well as unique to each phenotype.
3:::Readable results were obtained from 235 strains by GenoType MTBDRplus assay. Compared to DST, the sensitivity of GenoType MTBDRplus assay to detect RFP, INH, and multidrug resistance was 97.7%, 69.9%, and 69.8%, respectively, whereas the specificity for detecting RFP, INH, and multidrug resistance was 66.7%, 69.2%, and 76.8%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the GenoType MTBDRsl assay were 90.9% and 95.2% for OFX, 77.8% and 99.5% for KM, 63.7% and 86.4% for EMB, respectively. Mutations in codon S531L of the rpoB gene and codon S315T1 of KatG gene were dominated in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains.
3:::All caregivers experienced feelings of different intensities of burden (52% mild-to-moderate, 43% moderate-to-severe and 5% severe), and none of them expressed little or no burden at the assessment moment. Caregivers main worries were ""dependence"" and ""the future of the injured."" Resilience was medium-to-high (mean = 141.93, SD = 23.44) for the whole sample with just a minority of them revealing low (15%) or very low resilience (7%). The highest scores were obtained in relation to ""caregivers' independence"" and ""meaning of their lives."" Life satisfaction scores were medium-to-high (mean = 36.6, SD = 6). These scores were not related to demographics or the severity of the injury. Zarit Burden Interview scores were negatively correlated to Resilience Scale ( r = -.370, P = .001) and Life Satisfaction Checklist scores ( r = -.412, P < .001).'
3:::Seventy-one percent of the 87 sera had antibodies against one or more pathogens. ADV accounted for the highest seroprevalence (29%), followed by T. gondii (26%), L. interrogans (14%), M. bovis (12%), B. abortus (9%), N. caninum (3%), CPV (3%) and CDV (2%). Seroprevalence was influenced by location but not sex or age. Additionally, 16% of the seropositive samples for ADV had gammaglobulin levels >40.0 g/L. Antibody titers for CDV and CPV were low and difficult to interpret as almost all these cases had borderline concentrations.
3:::A total of 60 young female AMI (<7 days) patients were enrolled. From their CAG and intracoronary imaging results, the prevalence of SCAD in young female AMI population was 35% (21/60), the prevalence of coronary atherosclerostic heart disease was 65% (39/60). In the SCAD group, 43% (9/21) presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and the remainder presenting as STEMI. SCAD usually occurred in a single vessel (20/21, 95%), especially in left anterior descending artery (14/21, 67%). Eighteen patients (18/21, 86%) underwent conservative treatment, whereas the remaining three patients (3/21, 14%) underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. Regarding the angiographic results of SCAD lesions, intramural hematoma was discriminated in 95% (20/21), and Type I imaging was observed in 5% (1/21), Type II was observed in 67% (14/21), and Type III was 29% (6/21). The average stenosis in the group was 76.9% ± 20.6%, and the mean lesion length was 36.6 ± 8.6 mm.
3:::A total of 11,955 patients were included, 6738 were males and 5217 were females. The mean age at dialysis initiation was 57.7 ± 16.1 years. The median follow-up time was 19.8 months. There were total 2555 deaths. The overall mortality rate was 8.2 per 100 patient-years. Mortality rates were 18.7, 7.5, 6.9, 6.9, 6.5 and 6.2 in each period. The first 2 months mortality rates were 41.9 and 16.6 per 100 patient-years. Higher mortality was observed in patients who were older, female, diabetic and hypertensive.
3:::Seven articles were identified. Different strategies were used by the authors to model the economic/public health impact of dairy products. The four studies assessing the public health impact of dairy products revealed a substantial benefit in terms of fracture prevented, life years, disability-adjusted life years and/or quality-adjusted life years gained. Studies assessing the cost-effectiveness revealed that the use of dairy products is generally cost-effective in the general population aged above 70 years, and from the age of 60 years in populations at high risk of fractures.
3:::Prolonged, significant sox9 overexpression via rAAV was achieved in the aspirates for at least 28 days when applying the rAAV-FLAG-hsox9 construct, leading to higher, prolonged levels of matrix biosynthesis and to enhanced chondrogenic activities relative to control treatments especially when maintaining the samples under mechanical stimulation. Administration of sox9 however did not impact the indices of proliferation in the aspirates. Remarkably, sox9 gene transfer also durably delayed hypertrophic and osteogenic differentiation in the samples regardless of the conditions of culture applied versus control treatments.
3:::A total of 463 patients were enrolled in the study, and the observed hospital mortality was 26.1% (121/463). The patients enrolled were divided into survivors and nonsurvivors. Age, SAPS 3 score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation Score II (APACHE II), and predicted mortality were significantly higher in nonsurvivors than survivors (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The AUC (95% confidence intervals [CI s]) for SAPS 3 score was 0.836 (0.796-0.876). The maximum of Youdens index, cutoff, sensitivity, and specificity of SAPS 3 score were 0.526%, 70.5 points, 66.9%, and 85.7%, respectively. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test for SAPS 3 demonstrated a Chi-square test score of 10.25, P = 0.33, SMR (95% CI) = 0.63 (0.52-0.76). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test for SAPS 3 (AUS) demonstrated a Chi-square test score of 9.55, P = 0.38, SMR (95% CI) = 0.68 (0.57-0.81). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted for biochemical variables that were probably correlated to prognosis. Eventually, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), albumin,lactate and free triiodothyronine (FT3) were selected as independent risk factors for predicting prognosis.'
3:::For those readmitted within 0 to 30 days, reasons for readmission were other medical conditions (62.5%), recurrent stroke (30.4%), and elective procedure (7.1%). For those readmitted within 31 to 90 days, reasons for readmission were other medical conditions (62.3%), recurrent stroke (15.1%), and elective procedure (22.6%). There was no significant relationship between being evaluated within 21 days and readmission at 0 to 30 or 31 to 90 days. However, those who did have a neurology follow-up at any point in time had a lower readmission rate of 10.6% compared to those who never came back (19.2%, P = .017). Patients with coronary artery disease and diabetes had a significantly higher likelihood of readmission within 0 to 30 days.
3:::Of the 94 patients, four underwent conservative treatment and 90 underwent operations. Seventy-five patients (79.8%) were followed up for a minimum of 24 months or until death. The median follow-up duration was 75.3 months. The overall recurrence rate was 37.3%. Ten patients (13.3%) died before the last follow-up (median: 18.5 months). Two patients (2.6%) developed osteogenic sarcoma. The local recurrence rate was 80.0% (24/30) in patients who underwent intralesional curettage, 8.8% (3/34) in patients who underwent extracapsular piecemeal spondylectomy, and 0 (0/9) in patients who underwent TES. The risk factors for local recurrence were lesions located in the cervical spine (P = 0.049), intralesional curettage (P < 0.001), repeated surgeries (P = 0.014), and malignancy (P < 0.001). Malignant transformation was a significant risk factor for death (P < 0.001).
3:::There were 565 patients with ischemic stroke included in the analysis. The median ADL/IADL score was 2.32 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.41-3.41). The median opportunity score was 1 (IQR: 0.8-1), and 58.4% of the patients received defect-free care. After adjustment, the opportunity score (P = .67) and defect-free care (P = .92) were not associated with functional outcome.
3:::The male:female ratio was 2.7:1. Mean age at diagnosis was 48 years (± 12). Main symptoms were cough (87.6%), expectoration (40%), blood-stained sputum (37.2%), fever (26.9%), chest pain (24.8%) and haemoptysis (16.6%). Eighty-eight (60.7%) patients had no underlying disease. Only five patients received a correct initial diagnosis; 60 patients were misdiagnosed with lung cancer, followed by pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and lung abscess. Most patients were diagnosed using surgical resection, transthoracic needle aspiration or flexible bronchoscopy. Sixty-seven patients received penicillin G, and one patient did not receive any antibiotics after surgery. The mean duration of treatment with antibiotics was 4.5 months (±3.7). Overall, 110 (75.9%) patients were fully cured, 4 died, 1 was lost to follow-up, and a record of the prognosis was not available for 30 patients. Mean duration of follow-up was 26 months (± 32).
3:::Of 538 women, 60 (11%) had household food insecurity, 47 (78%) of which were moderate or severe food insecure. After mitogen stimulation, moderate or severe food insecure women had a median IFN-γ concentration of 4.2 IU/ml (IQR 2.2-9.8) vs. 8.4 IU/ml (IQR 3.0-10) in women with no or mild food insecurity (P = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, higher IFN-γ concentrations were associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection (OR 1.3, 95%CI 0.51-2.1, P = 0.001), and inversely associated with moderate or severe food insecurity (OR -1.6, 95%CI -2.9 to -0.27, P = 0.02) and the number of adults in the household (OR -0.08, 95%CI -0.16 to -0.01, P = 0.03). There was no association between food insecurity and IFN-γ response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen.
3:::Standardised notification rates ranged from 4.41 to 76.44 notifications per 100 000 population. Forty-one high-risk and 156 low-risk municipalities were identified. There was no statistically significant association between TB notification rate and the EDI, but some of its variables, such as the proportion of manual workers and the percentage unemployed, were significantly and directly associated with TB notification, whereas the variable proportion of residents with low education level' showed an inverse relationship.'
3::: (68)Ga-AGuIX@NODAGA was proven to passively accumulate in U87MG human glioblastoma tumor xenografts. Metabolite assessment in serum, urine and tumor samples showed that (68)Ga-AGuIX@NODAGA remains unmetabolized up to at least 60 min postinjection.
3:::Overall clinical failure occurred in 26% (24 of 91 patients) at 2-year follow-up. Clinical failure occurred in: 28% (Maverick) (7 of 25 patients), 39% (Charité) (12 of 31 patients), and 14% (Kineflex) (5 of 35 patients). Causes of failure included facet pathology, 50% of failure patients (12 of 24). Implant complications occurred in 5% of total patients and 21% of failure patients (5 of 24). Only 5 patients went from a success to failure after 3 months. Only 1 patient went from a failure to success after a facet rhizotomy 1 year after ADR.
3:::Overall, 26 studies were retrieved through the literature search. Ten studies including 720 patients met selection criteria. The use of fibrin-thrombin sealant patches to the sole scope of reducing lymphadenectomy-related complications significantly reduced the incidence of lymphocele, symptomatic lymphocele, the need of percutaneous drainage procedures, the volume of lymph drained, and the duration of the drainage. No effect on wound and/or lymphocele infection was noted.
3:::MiR-500 is upregulated in both prostate cancer cells and primary tumors. In prostate cancer patients, high miR-500 expression is associated with poor prognosis and overall survival. In DU145 and VCaP cells, miR-500 downregulation inhibited cancer proliferation, invasion in vitro, and explant growth in vivo. TFPI was verified to be associated with miR-500 in prostate cancer. Downregulation of TFPI reversed anti-cancer effects of miR-500 downregulation in prostate cancer cells. However, neither TFPI upregulation nor downregulation alone had any functional impact on prostate cancer development.
3:::Participants had a mean (SD) age of 70 (9) years and were 60% women, 66% Hispanic, 15% white, and 18% black. Those with greater cIMT exhibited worse episodic memory after adjustment for demographics and vascular risk factors (β=-0.60; P=0.04). APOE ε4 carriers with greater cIMT exhibited worse episodic memory (β=-1.31; P=0.04), semantic memory (β=-1.45; P=0.01), and processing speed (β=-1.21; P=0.03). Participants with greater cIMT at baseline did not exhibit significantly greater cognitive decline after adjustment. APOE ε4noncarriers with greater cIMT exhibited greater declines in executive function (β=-0.98; P=0.06). Carotid plaque burden was not significantly associated with cognition at baseline or over time.
3:::CBCT data revealed 0.79 ± 0.73 mm ridge width reduction from grafting to implant placement. Histomorphometric analysis of core biopsy samples revealed in average 21.34 ± 9.14% of new bone in the grafted sites. Primary implant stability was high (ISQ levels 70.3 ± 9.6) and further increased until final restoration.
3:::Carpolobia lutea exhibited concentration-dependent anti-AChE activity. The most potent inhibitory activity for the stem was the crude ethanol extract and hexane stem fraction oil (IC50 = 140 μg/mL); for the leaves, the chloroform leaf fraction (IC50 = 60 μg/mL); and for roots, the methanol, ethyl acetate and aqueous root fractions (IC50 = 0.3-3 μg/mL). Dose-dependent free radical scavenging activity and reducing power were observed with increasing stem, leaf or root concentration. Total phenolic contents were the highest in the stem: ∼632 mg gallic acid equivalents/g for a hexane stem fraction oil. Total flavonoid content was the highest in the leaves: ∼297 mg quercetin equivalents/g for a chloroform leaf fraction. At 1 μg/mL, only the crude ethanol extract oil was significantly cytotoxic to hepatocytes.
3:::Our results showed that NNT-AS1 expression in cervical cancer tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues the overexpression of NNT-AS1 was positively associated with advanced FIGO stage, lymph node metastasis, depth of cervical invasion and poorer overall survival. Function assays showed that NNT-AS1 inhibition could suppress cervical cancer cells proliferation and invasion ability in vitro as well as the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In vivo mice xenograft model revealed that silencing NNT-AS1 could reduce tumor growth in nude mice.
3:::Mesenchymal stem cells express tissue factor on their surfaces and are procoagulant in the presence of blood or plasma. The adipose-derived MSCs (Ad-MSC) evaluated were more procoagulant and expressed more tissue factor than bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs), which showed a greater variability in TF expression. Bone marrow MSCs were identified that exhibited low procoagulant activity, whereas all Ad-MSCs examined exhibited high procoagulant activity. The percentage of cells in a given population expressing surface tissue factor correlates roughly with functional procoagulant activity. Mesenchymal stem cell tissue factor expression and procoagulant activity change over time in culture.
3:::BDNF and IGF-1 expression was transiently upregulated in both cortex and hippocampus after PBBI. Although BDNF levels increased at acute timepoints, IGF-1 expression peaked at 3 days in cortical homogenates. Although there was loss of staining in cells bordering the cavity, increased BDNF and IGF-1 immunoreactivity was observed in scattered neurons away from the contusion site. Glial upregulation of both growth factors was observed at early timepoints in the hippocampus.
3:::Four hundred three records were screened. Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Four scales were identified: the Scale for Contraversive Pushing (SCP), the Modified Scale for Contraversive Pushing (M-SCP), the Burke Lateropulsion Scale (BLS), and the Swedish Scale for Contraversive Pushing (S-SCP). Psychometric property investigation was most robust for the SCP and the BLS. Cross-cultural validity has not been fully investigated in scales used outside of their country of origin.
3:::Serum bio-intact PTH concentrations were strongly correlated but significantly lower than the intact PTH concentrations (r=0.963, P<0.0001). This finding was consistent among CKD stages 3 to 5. PTH concentrations by both assays (intact and bio-intact PTH) positively correlated with urea (r=0.523, r=0.504; P=0.002, respectively), phosphorus (r=0.532, r=0.521; P<0.0001, respectively) and negatively correlated with blood calcium (r=-0.435, r=-0.476; P<0.0001, respectively), 25(OH) vitamin D, (r=-0.319, r=-0.353; respectively, P<0.0001) and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (r=-0.717, r=-0.688; P<0.0001, respectively).
3:::(1) Skin markings delineating the position of US-visualized landmarks corresponded almost perfectly to anatomical dissection. (2) Nine (64.2%) of 14 specimens had complete division of the transverse carpal ligament. In the remaining 5 specimens, an average of 68.8% of the ligament was transected. (3) No adjacent structures were damaged. (4) Time to complete the procedure was on average 9.9 ± 4.6 minutes. (5) Average procedural difficulty was 4.3/10.
3:::Seventy-eight strains were identified as resistant to at least one carbapenem; these CRKP strains had a high prevalence rate (38.5%, 30/78) of carbapenemase producers. Additionally, most isolates harbored MDR genes, including Extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC, and quinolone and aminoglycoside resistance genes. Loss of porin genes was observed, and Class 1 integron was detected in 66.7% of the investigated isolates. PFGE and MLST results excluded the occurrence of clonal dissemination among these isolates.
3:::Across treatment conditions, 45-60% of the patients who completed posttreatment assessment showed clinically meaningful change for most outcome measures. We found no significant differences between the treatment conditions on any of the outcome measures at both posttreatment and follow-up. Noninferiority of psychodynamic therapy to CBT was shown for posttreatment and follow-up anxiety measures as well as for posttreatment pain and quality of life measures, but could not be consistently demonstrated for the other outcomes.
3:::Twenty-five of the 263 isolates (9.5%) showed resistance to fosfomycin, and 18 (6.8%) were positive for fosA3. None of the isolates was positive for fosA or fosC2. Seventeen of the isolates carrying fosA3 (94%) were CTX-M producers (seven CTX-M-55, five CTX-M-14, and five CTX-M-123), while three (16.7%) were TEM producers (TEM-1).Sixteen (88.9%) fosA3-carrying isolates exhibited multi-drug resistance. The replicon types of the 13 fosA3-carrying plasmids were IncF (n=13), IncHI2 (n=3), IncIl-Ir (n=2), and IncN (n=1).
3:::TST in nurses working evening rotating shift was higher than that for those working the day or night rotating shift and fixed day shift. WASO was significantly longer on Day 2 for rotating shift participants working evening versus day shift. SOL and SE were significantly shorter and lower in rotating shift nurses working night versus both day and evening shifts.
3:::Eighty-seven community-dwelling people between the ages of 65 and 90 were recruited, the majority (76%) being women. Seventy-one percent of subjects reported talking to their provider regarding the fall; 37% reported engaging in falls prevention activities. No subjects reported enrolling in a fall prevention program although two reported contacting falls program staff. Fourteen percent of subjects (n=12) reported a recurrent fall and 8% (7) reported returning to the ED after a recurrent fall.
3:::Overall HPV prevalence was 27.8%, with 22.2% HR-HPV and 11.4% LR-HPV. The five most common carcinogens were HPV 52 (3.2%), 58 (2.7%), 16 (2.0%), 56 (1.9%), and 51 (1.8%). The five most common HR-HPVs in normal cytology samples were HPV 53, 68, 70, 52, and 58, while HPV 16, 52, 58, 33, and 31 were prevalent in high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). In atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), the prevalence of HR-HPV varied with age; it was highest in those aged <30 yr, declining to a minimum at age 50-59 yr, and then increasing in older women (P<0.05).
3:::MRI identified two main patterns of presentation: global enlargement of the pituitary gland or panhypophysitis (n = 4, PH), and pituitary stalk abnormality only, or infundibulo-neuro-hypophysitis (n = 8, INH). Multiple tropin defects were more common in PH (100%) than those in INH (28% P = 0.014), whereas diabetes insipidus was more common in INH (100%) than that in PH (50%; P = 0.028). All 4 PH and 4 out of 8 INH were treated with glucocorticoids. Pituitary volume significantly reduced in all PH patients (P = 0.012), defective anterior pituitary function recovered only in the two patients without diabetes insipidus (50%) and panhypopituitarism persisted, along with diabetes insipidus, in the remaining 2 (50%). In all INH patients, either treated or untreated, pituitary stalk diameter reduced (P = 0.008) but diabetes insipidus persisted in all.
3:::Monofilament and neurothesiometer readings were measured in 1981 patients, mean age 57.4±10.8 years old. DPN prevalence was 10.8% (n=214). Patients with DPN compared to those without, were significantly older (p<0.0001), with longer duration of T2D (p<0.0001), had higher BMI (p=0.006), higher glucose (p=0.015) and HbA1c (p<0.0001), Systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p<0.0001), lower eGFR (p<0.0001), higher urine ACR (p<0.0001), poorer endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation (both p<0.0001), higher VCAM-1 (p<0.0001) and higher apoC-III [285.3 (195.2-405.6) vs 242.9(165.0-344.0) μg/ml]. After adjustment, log transformed apoC-III, remained independently associated with the presence of DPN (B=0.965, SE=0.397, p=0.015).
3:::Multivariate regression analysis showed that smaller postoperative DCSA was significantly associated with early postoperative radicular pain (per -10 mm; odds ratio, 1.26). The best cutoff value for radicular pain was early postoperative DCSA of 67.7 mm. Even with a cutoff value of <70 mm, sensitivity and specificity are 74.3% and 75.0%, respectively. Early postoperative DCSA was significantly larger before suction drain removal than after (119.7±10.1 vs. 93.9±5.4 mm).
3:::4790 participants (20.9%) had an FLI≥60. NAFLD subjects were older, more likely to be men, more obese and more often had diabetes and metabolic syndrome (P<0.001 for each). Among NAFLD subjects, any apoB dyslipoproteinemia was present in 61.5% vs. 16.5% in subjects without NAFLD (P<0.001). Elevated chylomicrons were not observed in NAFLD. In univariate analysis, NAFLD was associated with a higher prevalence of each apoB dyslipoproteinemia vs. subjects with an FLI<60 (P<0.001), except for low density lipoprotein (LDL) dyslipoproteinemia. Additionally, each apoB dyslipoproteinemia was independently associated with NAFLD in age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression analysis, including the apoB dyslipoproteinemias together (P<0.001). The prevalence of apoB dyslipoproteinemias was not altered in subjects with NFS ≥0.676.
3:::Thirteen percent of women were early pregnancy smokers, 20% former smokers, and 68% never smokers. Infants of early pregnancy smokers had lower IGF-1 adjusted for IGFBP-3 [-5.2ng/mL (95% CI: -8.6, -1.7)], with more pronounced associations in girls [-10.7ng/mL (95% CI: -18.5, -2.9) vs. -4.0ng/mL (95% CI: -8.4, 0.4) for boys]. Early pregnancy smoking was not associated with cord blood hormones other than IGF-1. Infants of former smokers had a cord blood hormone profile similar to infants of never smokers.
3:::The mean total costs associated with failed instrumented lumbar fusion using ICBG and reoperation using rhBMP-2 totaled £47,734 per patient. The total direct costs of a policy of primary instrumented lumbar fusion with rhBMP-2 were less at £26,923 per patient; however, this was not significant.
3:::We found no statistically significant difference between the control group and the study group concerning ISV (P=0.6808) and ISH (P=0.8981) 6 months after surgery. No statistically significant differences were found between ODI, VAS back, and VAS legs after 6 months between the 2 groups, however, there were statistically significant differences between these parameters in different time periods. Correlation between the volume of disc tissue removed and preoperative versus postoperative difference in ISV was statistically significant (P=0.0020).
3:::Substantial differences were seen in self-assessed health status between women with and without recurrence; 33.6% and 82.4% of women with and without recurrence rated their health as good to excellent, respectively. More patients with recurrence of disease reported limitations in moderate activity than those without. Furthermore, 79.0% of women without recurrence reported that pain did not affect or only slightly affected daily activities, compared with 28.2% with recurrence. Most women with recurrence (59.5%) reported that they were able to do less than they wanted to because of their emotional status compared with only 15.8% of women without recurrence. In addition, 66.4% of women with recurrence referred that they had problems concentrating at work and home versus 26.3% of women without recurrence.
3:::Forty (30 women, age 36±11 y) participants completed the study, 33 with LBP (13 MT, 13 sham ultrasound treatment, and 7 no treatment) and 7 without LBP. Participants with or without LBP could not be differentiated on the basis of serum cytokine levels, PPT, or MDT (P≥0.08). There were no significant differences between the groups at 1 hour or 24 hours on serum cytokines, PPT, or MDT (P≥0.07). There was a significant decrease from baseline in IL-6 for the no treatment (LBP) group (P=0.04), in C-reactive protein for the sham ultrasound treatment group (P=0.03), in MDT for all 3 LBP groups (P≤0.02), and in self-reported pain for the MT and sham ultrasound treatment groups (P=0.03 and 0.01).
3:::Most of the 55 respondents from 8 countries perceived CR as important for outpatient care (mean ± SD = 4.83 ± 0.38 out of 5; higher scores indicating more positive perceptions), with benefits including reduced hospital readmissions (4.31 ± 0.48) and length of stay (4.64 ± 0.71 days), not only for cardiac patients but for those with other vascular conditions (4.34 ± 0.68 days). Those working in public institutions (50.9%) and in institutions without a CR program (25.0%) were not as aware of, and less likely to value, CR services (P < .05). Only 13.2% of programs had dedicated funding.
3:::For all the sagittal parameters, SVA, PI, SS, and LL in retrolisthesis group were found to be significantly lower than those in the anterolisthesis group and in the control group, respectively (P<0.05), whereas TLK in retrolisthesis group was significantly larger than other 2 groups (P<0.01). In addition, the average Pfirrmann disk score was 2.11 at levels with retrolisthesis indicating that the disks were not severely degenerated.
3:::The Siremobil Iso-C 3D requires 128 seconds for its 190-degree scanning arc with equidistant isocenter. The Vision FD Vario 3D performs an elliptical scanning arc and completes its 135-degree scan in 64 seconds; furthermore, it features a flat panel detector and fully digital imaging. The smaller dimensions of the Vision FD Vario 3D made it easier to maneuver in the operating room compared with the more bulky Siremobil Iso-C 3D. With respect to image quality in cervical 3D scans, the Siremobil Iso-C 3D reached significantly higher scores in all categories. The Vision FD Vario 3D revealed less artifacts in lumbar 3D scans.
3:::miR-155 deficiency ameliorated liver IR injury, and inhibition of KCs by GdCl3 abolished this protective effect. miR-155 deficiency decreased CD80, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex class II expression in KCs after IR and tipped the M1/M2 balance toward an anti-inflammatory profile, where proinflammatory cytokine secretion was suppressed and IL-10 was enhanced. In addition, hepatocyte apoptosis was reduced in coculture with miR-155-deficient KCs in vitro.
3:::SH conditions generated greater deficits than MH conditions, and these more severe effects hastened the termination of exposures (5 vs. 18 min mean duration, respectively). Workstation performance collapsed rapidly on SH exposure, with Mathematics and Auditory Monitoring tasks proving vulnerable to breakdown. In MH exposures, these tasks exhibited impaired accuracy (declining 11% and 9%, respectively) and speed, with declines in Auditory Monitoring lingering into recovery.
3:::The initial average pullout force (6.5-mm screw) was 837 N (±329 N) and 642 N (±318 N) in L2-L3 and L4-L5 left pedicles, and 705 N (±451 N) and 779 N (±378 N) in L2-L3 and L4-L5 right pedicles, respectively. Comparison of revision pullout forces versus initial pullout forces revealed the following: 87% and 63% for AS in L2-L3 and L4-L5 left pedicles, respectively; 56% for 7.5-mm and 93% for 8.5-mm TPS in L2-L3 and L4-L5 right pedicles, respectively.
3:::Six controls and nine exercisers completed the study. There was an overall effect of BR on our outcomes. Except Goldmann IOP (mean pre/post difference in controls and exercisers: -0.47 mmHg vs. +1.14 mmHg), the magnitude of changes from baseline was not significantly different between groups. There was a +1.38 mmHg and a +1.63 mmHg iCare IOP increase during BR in controls and exercisers, respectively. Spectralis OCT detected a +1.33 μm average cpRNFL thickness increase in both groups, and a +9.77 μm and a +6.65 μm peripapillary retinal thickening post-BR in controls and exercisers, respectively. Modified Amsler grid, red dot test, confrontational visual field, color vision, and stereoscopic fundus photography were unremarkable.
3:::The CAMISS-TLIF group had significantly less blood loss, postoperative drain, need for transfusion, and initial postoperative back pain; earlier rehabilitation; and shorter postoperative hospitalization than the open TLIF group, whereas CAMISS-TLIF took longer surgical time than open TLIF. However, no significant differences between the 2 groups in visual analog scale scores and Oswestry disability index were observed at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. A total of 93.33% and 73.39% of screws in the CAMISS and open groups, respectively, had no pedicle perforation (P=0.016), and the fusion rate was similar in both groups (P=0.787).
3:::All sway parameters of pwMS of Classes 2 and 3, as well as total TUG duration and time necessary to perform 180° turns, were found significantly higher than HC and Class 1 participants. However, poor correlations were found between sway and TUG parameters. When pwMS are grouped, small/moderate correlations (in the range 0.20-0.41) were found between all sway parameters and total TUG duration.
3:::(18)F-florbetaben PET showed lower uptake in the white matter lesion visualized in the CT and MRI images. Decreased tracer uptake was also observed in a larger area of the left hemisphere beyond the lesions observed on MRI or CT. White matter lesion volume on FLAIR was 44.2mL, and tracer uptake change between damaged white matter and normal appearing white matter was - 40.5%. Standardized uptake value was inferior in the pseudotumoral lesion than in the other white matter lesions.
3:::Median age of multiple sclerosis onset corresponded to late onset multiple sclerosis. No association with multiple sclerosis was observed for truncal vagotomy (0-37 year adjusted HR=0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.48-1.74) or super-selective vagotomy (0-37 year adjusted HR=1.28, 95% CI: 0.79-2.09) compared with the general population.
3:::The majority of patients were males, and average age at diagnosis was 37.5 years (range: 22-52 yrs). Two patients presented full clinical triad at onset, while the remaining developed visual and/or auditory disturbances later during the course of disease. All cases manifested varied neurological symptoms including pyramidal and/or sensory tract symptoms, amnesic disorders, ataxia and vertigo. Psychiatric manifestations such as disinhibition, aggressive behavior, paranoid ideation and hallucinations were also present. Seven patients suffered at least one relapse. Typical central corpus callosum fiber ischemias/infarcts, also known as snowball lesions were visible in all patients. Spokes, icicles, periventricular lesions and internal capsule ""string of beads"" patterns were observed on diffusion weighted images. Four cases presented fornix microischemias/microinfarctions, 5 juxtacortical involvement and 3 infratentorial infarcts. Leptomeningeal involvement was evident in only 1 patient after rabies vaccination. Fluorescein angiography was abnormal in 7 cases. Tonal audiometry revealed unilateral hypoacusia in 5 patients, 3 with low frequency hearing loss. Immunosuppressive treatment was indicated in all cases. Patient follow up ranged between 6 months and 9 years, only 1 patient was lost to follow up after three years.
3:::Pathogenic variants of the LMNA gene were determined in nine families. Of those, typical exon 8 codon 482 pathogenic variants were identified in four families. Analysis of the LMNA gene also revealed exon 1 codon 47, exon 5 codon 306, exon 6 codon 349, exon 9 codon 528, and exon 11 codon 582 pathogenic variants. Analysis of the PPARG gene revealed exon 3 p.Y151C pathogenic variant in two families and exon 7 p.H477L pathogenic variant in one family. A non-pathogenic exon 5 p.R215Q variant of the LMNB2 gene was detected in another family. Five other families harbored no mutation in any of the genes sequenced. MRI studies showed slightly different fat distribution patterns among subjects with different point mutations, though it was strikingly different in subjects with LMNA p.R349W pathogenic variant. Subjects with pathogenic variants of the PPARG gene were associated with less prominent fat loss and relatively higher levels of leptin compared to those with pathogenic variants in the LMNA gene. Various metabolic abnormalities associated with insulin resistance were detected in all subjects. End-organ complications were observed.
3:::The EEP polar fractions exhibited up to 90% protection against lipid peroxidation. The IC50 value for anti-glycation activity of EEP was between 16.5 and 19.2 μg/mL, close to aminoguanidine (IC50 = 7.7 μg/mL). The use of UHPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS allowed the identification of 12 bioactive phenols in the EEP and 24 volatile compounds, all already reported.
3:::Compared with controls, 5-FU reduced QoL, measured by the Skindex symptom, Skindex function and SCI social subscales (P < 0.001, P < 0.01, P = 0.02, respectively). At 1 month, significant changes in QoL in the 5-FU group were observed in the Skindex symptom (10.1, 95% CI 0.36-12.6), Skindex function (6.0, 95% CI 4.0-8.0) and SCI social (-3.5, 95% CI -6.2 to -0.8) subscales, while the other subscales of Skindex and SCI did not show significant changes. All three Skindex subscales at 1 month correlated with patient-reported symptom score and photograph-based toxicity score, whereas social subscale was the only one of the SCI subscales that correlated with patient-reported symptom and photograph-based toxicity scores.
3:::We found one significant DMP (cg03559389, DIP2C) and 104 significant DMRs after multiple-testing correction. Of these, 34 DMRs mapped to genes differential expressed with respect to the same trait. Five of the genes were associated with more than two traits: CTU2, USP36, ZNF516, KLK10 and CPT1B.
3:::We identified 10,988 citations, yielding 26 articles for further analysis; three studies with 267 patients were finally analyzed. Most patients (n = 135) were comatose due to head trauma. Systemic antibiotic administration was associated with decreased incidence of EO-VAP (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.19-0.54) and shorter ICU LOS (standardized mean difference -0.32; 95% CI -0.56 to -0.08), but had no effect on mortality (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.7-1.53) or duration of mechanical ventilation (standardized mean difference -0.16; 95% CI -0.41 to 0.08).
3:::The acupressure group reported 11 mm less pain (95% CI: 5-17) on average than the sham acupressure group, and 9 mm less (95% CI: 3-16) than the control group as a result of the intervention (P < 0.05). There was no difference between groups in: anxiety levels, or in any of the secondary outcome measures.
3:::All 4 to 6 planned DQRF sessions were well tolerated in both the vaginal laxity and VVA/GSM arms of the study, with no troubling pain, thermal injury or other immediate adverse effects during all the procedures. All screened women completed the planned DQRF treatment sessions in both arms of the extension study. There was no participant attrition with only a few occasionally missing visits over the 12-month follow-up period. Improvements were rapid in self-perception of introital looseness and related symptoms like dysuria/urinary incontinence and unrewarding sexual relationship (vaginal laxity patients) and atrophy-related symptoms including painful and unsatisfactory sexual activity (VVA/GSM patients). Participating women consistently reported wide-spectrum strong clinical improvements by the end of the planned DQRF sessions. Clinical improvements remained steady for the whole follow-up period in postmenopausal women; a statistically non-significant tendency to slight deterioration in VLQ, PISQ-12 and SSQ mean scores was detected after 6 to 9 months of follow-up in the vaginal laxity arm of the study.
3:::Of the 522 patients who completed the study, eight (1.5%) had a definitive periocular allergic contact dermatitis to the NPD ophthalmic ointment. Allergic presentation ranged from postoperative day 3 to 14.
3:::Aspects of hockey culture such as an overemphasis on winning games and upheld misperceptions about the risks associated with concussion were identified as relevant to the underreporting of concussions. Various factors relevant to the underreporting of concussions include players motivation to win, group membership dynamics such as a player's role as the team's ""enforcer,"" coaches' own motivation to win to further their own opportunities in the sport, and parents' personal financial interest or alternative agenda in terms of time commitments and their child's future career prospects.'
3:::Only the average bone shape of the < 40-year subgroup was statistically different from that of the other two groups. When the population was divided into two subgroups using 40 years of age as a threshold, the subjects age was correctly assigned 80% of the time.'
3:::Ten patients were examined, 6 ventilated with PSV/PAV+ and 4 with PSV/NAVA. Despite the same mean inspiratory pressure at baseline between the modes, baseline VO2 (median, IQR) was higher during proportional ventilation (301 ml/min, 270-342) compared to PSV (249 ml/min, 206-353). Exercise with PSV was associated with a significant increase in VO2 (ΔVO2, median, IQR) (77.6 ml/min, 59.9-96.5), while VO2 did not significantly change during exercise with proportional modes (46.3 ml/min, 5.7-63.7, p < 0.05). As a result, exercise with proportional modes was associated with a better work efficiency than with PSV. The ventilator modes did not affect patients dyspnea, limb fatigue, distance, hemodynamics and breathing pattern.'
3:::Of the 6303 patients admitted, 843 (13.4%) had ESBL-PE carriage detected. Among carriers, 111 (13%) patients developed ICU-acquired pneumonia of whom 48 (43%) had ESBL-PE pneumonia (6% of carriers). By multivariable analysis, SAPS II at admission >43 [OR 2.81 (1.16-6.79)] and colonization with Enterobacter sp. or K. pneumoniae species [OR 10.96 (2.93-41.0)] were independent predictive factors for ESBL-PE pneumonia in colonized patients, whereas receipt of >2 days of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid during the ICU stay [OR 0.24 (0.08-0.71)] was protective. Patients with ESBL-PE pneumonia had a higher SOFA score (p = 0.037) and more frequent septic shock at pneumonia onset (p = 0.047). However, ESBL-PE pneumonia was not an independent predictor of mortality. Twenty-five patients had pneumonia caused by CRB. Chronic renal insufficiency, administration of third-generation cephalosporin within the past 3 months, acute respiratory distress syndrome before pneumonia and prior therapy with a carbapenem or fluoroquinolones were associated with CRB pneumonia in this selected population.
3:::From 2005 to 2014, there were 13,583 live births during approximately 78,000 person years of follow-up of women aged 15-49 years. The total fertility rate in HIV-negative women decreased from 6.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.5 to 6.8] in 2005-2006 to 5.1 (4.8-5.5) in 2011-2014. In HIV-positive women, the total fertility rate was more stable, although lower, at 4.4 (3.2-6.1) in 2011-2014. In 2011-2014, compared with HIV-negative women, the adjusted (age, marital status, and education) hazard ratio was 0.7 (95% CI: 0.6 to 0.9) and 0.8 (95% CI: 0.6 to 1.0) for women on ART for at least 9 months and not (yet) on ART, respectively. The crude fertility rate increased with duration on ART up to 3 years before declining. The proportion of HIV-exposed infants decreased, but the proportion of ART-exposed infants increased from 2.4% in 2007-2010 to 3.5% in 2011-2014.
3:::A total of 463 ECC patients were identified. No LNM was detected among the 161 (34.8%) patients who met the criteria and were defined as Very Low Risk. In the other 302 patients, the precise risk of LNM was calculated, and it was <1% in 31 (10.3%) patients.
3:::The sample included 20 959 children. Children with at least 2 CCCs had higher odds of PT/OT than children with no CCC. Children with DD had 12-fold higher odds of having any PT/OT compared with children with diagnosis. Children with a DD and 2 CCCs had the highest PT/OT spending.
3:::The mean anastomotic time in four patients who underwent Delta after RADG was 16.5 min. All patients were discharged on the post-operative day 7 without any post-operative complications or need for readmission.
3:::The child demonstrated gains in throwing accuracy, significant gains on measures of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-2, the Test of Gross Motor Development-2, and the School Function Assessment.
3:::No patients had symptoms or signs of DVT pre-operatively. No patient gave history of DVT. No patient was found to have iliac, femoral or popliteal vein thrombosis. Superficial venous disease was found in 17 (8%). One patient had a right lower limb venous ulcer.
3:::Our results showed no difference in mortality, length of hospital and ICU stays and incidence of major complications between three groups on uni- and multi-variate analysis (P > 0.05). The operative time was significantly longer in MIE group (odds ratio [OR]: 1.66, confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-11.5). The incidence of long-term complication was low for MIE (OR: 1.0, CI: 133-1.017). However, all post-operative surgical outcomes trended to improve in both groups over the course of this study and stayed better for MIE group except for the operative time.
3:::Demographic characteristics were not significantly different between the two groups. Compared with open group, the hospital stay and post-operative mechanical ventilation time were significantly shorter, while surgery duration was significantly longer in the endoscopic surgery group. The recurrence rate was higher and the survival rate was lower in the endoscopic surgery group with no statistically significant and the recurrence rate has decreased over the past 5 years.
3:::Thirty-one percent of patients (n = 10,910) at safety net hospitals underwent immediate reconstruction compared with 46 percent of patients (n = 14,619) at non-safety net hospitals (p < 0.001). Logistic regression revealed that women at non-safety net hospitals were significantly more likely to undergo reconstruction (OR, 1.89; 95 percent CI, 1.65 to 2.16). However, analysis by study year revealed that rates of reconstruction at safety net hospitals increased over time.
3:::Two patients with a history of previous abdominal surgery required omental adhesiolysis. Seventeen patients with breast cancer underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, ten had ovarian cystectomy (6 had cystadenoma, 2 had endometriotic cysts and 2 had dermoid cyst), six had excision of paraovarian cysts (one along with partial salpingectomy) and four with ruptured ectopic pregnancy underwent salpingectomy. LESS was completed in all but one patient, who required insertion of an additional 5 mm port. There were no intra- or post-operative complications.
3:::Among 176 cases and 704 controls, rectal gonorrhea, chlamydia and rectal STI in 12 months or less were associated with HIV diagnosis. The magnitude of these associations attenuated in the second model, but persisted in model 3 (gonorrhea: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.8; chlamydia: aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.3; prior STI: aOR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.5-6.2). One in 7 HIV diagnoses can be attributed to rectal STI.
3:::One hundred ninety-five cases were included. Preoperative imaging consisted of sonography (n = 169), magnetic resonance imaging (n = 152), or both (n = 126). With sonography, nipple involvement did not differ between nipple-sparing mastectomy candidates and noncandidates using a tumor-to-nipple distance cutoff of 2 cm (10.7 percent versus 10.6 percent; p = 0.988) or 1 cm (9.3 percent versus 15.0 percent; p = 0.307). With magnetic resonance imaging, nipple involvement did not differ between candidates and noncandidates using a cutoff of 2 cm (11.6 percent versus 12.5 percent; p = 0.881) or 1 cm (11.4 percent versus 13.8 percent; p = 0.718). When sonography and magnetic resonance imaging findings were both available and concordant, nipple involvement still did not differ between candidates and noncandidates using a cutoff of 2 cm (8.8 percent versus 11.8 percent; p = 0.711) or 1 cm (7.6 percent versus 14.3 percent; p = 0.535).
3:::The proportion of male gonorrhea cases among MSM varied by jurisdiction (range: 20% to 98%). Estimated MSM rate increased from 1369 cases per 100,000 in 2010 to 3435 cases per 100,000 in 2015. Between 2010 and 2015, the MSM-to-Women gonorrhea rate ratio increased from 13:1 to 24:1, and the MSM-to-MSW gonorrhea rate ratio increased from 16:1 to 31:1.
3:::Among women reporting LARC use, 24% used a condom. Dual users were less likely to have only 1 sexual partner (adjusted PR [aPR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.54-0.81) and be in a relationship. Dual users were more likely than LARC-only users to be Hispanic (aPR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.01-1.78), black (aPR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.07-1.83), and biracial/multiracial (aPR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.10-1.73).
3:::We included 195 patients. The median age was 62.9 years; the performance status was 0-1 in 80 and 2-3 in 92 patients. The median number of metastatic sites was one. A total of 73 patients (37.4%) were alive 12 months after beginning chemotherapy. In multivariate analysis, no liver metastasis, CA19-9 level <250 IU/ml and localized or locally advanced cancer at diagnosis were good prognostic factors. According to a clinical score based on these features, overall survival was 7.7, 13.5, 19.7 and 21.0 months, respectively (p<0.001).
3:::On univariate analysis, female gender (p=0.007), <40 pack years (p=0.029), not smoking during irradiation (p=0.037), TURBT (p=0.007) and KPS >70 (p<0.001) led to improved survival; EQD2 >55 Gy showed a trend (p=0.065) for such association. On Cox regression, gender [risk ratio (RR)=2.81; p=0.039], TURBT (RR=4.44; p=0.033) and KPS (RR=3.45; p=0.018) remained significant.
3:::The data were analyzed with an ANOVA. Saline administration did not alter logMAR acuity, contrast sensitivity, corneal fluorescein staining, or subjective complaints at any visit. Betadine administration significantly reduced the logMAR acuity, compared to baseline and the saline data, at the 30- and 60-minute visits (all P values <.05). The contrast sensitivity was significantly reduced compared to the baseline and the saline results at 5, 30, and 60 minutes after Betadine application (all P values <.05). The Betadine significantly increased the Schein questionnaire score, compared both to baseline and the saline data, at the 1- and 4-hour visits (all P values <.05). Total corneal staining and the maximum NEI sector staining were significantly different from baseline and from the saline results at every visit (all P values <.05).
3:::A total of 205 patients were included and 15 (7.3%) patients were identified as having EBV-positive gastric cancer. Age, gender, tumor location, and histological type showed no significant differences between EBV-positive and negative groups. EBV-positive cancer is significantly more frequent in the higher-metabolic-tumor group than in the lower one (p=0.032). The mean SUVmax of gastric cancers showed significant differences between EBV-positive and negative groups (9.9±4.2 vs. 7.0±4.8, p=0.026).
3:::A total of 155 parotidectomies were identified. Tumor size was the only statistically significant clinical predictor (Frey group: 43.5 ± 38.4 mm vs No Frey group: 33.1 ± 27.5 mm; P = 0.018). Disease pathology, type of resection, and previous treatments such as radiotherapy or parotidectomy did not appear to be associated with development of Frey syndrome.Post hoc analysis of our data showed that Frey incidence nearly doubled in patients with tumor size of 4 cm or greater (33%) compared to those with tumors that sized less than 4 cm (18%).
3:::Two hundred patients were enrolled in the study. Seventy five percent of patients were known to have rheumatic heart disease, while 16.5% had infective endocarditis. The mitral valve was replaced in 40% of patients, the aortic valve was replaced in 36%, and other patients had both valves replaced. Early postoperative period PVL was detected in 25 patients. The most common underlying etiologies were rheumatic heart disease and infective endocarditis. PVL was common in patients with both valves replaced compared with either mitral or aortic valve replacement. Infective endocarditis as underlying valve disease was significantly high in patients with PVL compared with those without (p < 0.001).
3:::Orthotopically implanted PDX-derived tumors consistently incorporated into the murine pancreatic parenchyma, metastasized to both the liver and lungs and induced muscle wasting directly proportional to the size of the tumor, consistent of the cancer cachexia syndrome.
3:::The prevalence of PCLs was 13.7%, which was increased according to age. Individuals with PCLs were more prone to obesity (body mass index, 24.0 vs 23.7 kg/m [P = 0.015]; waist circumference, 87.4 vs 85.5 cm [P < 0.001]). DM was more prevalent in individuals with PCLs (18.4% vs 10.5%, P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; P < 0.001), excess body mass index (OR, 1.26; P = 0.039), and DM (OR, 1.39; P = 0.005) were associated with PCLs.
3:::Initially, to know the normal range we measured AVP and CIMT in 50 patients without any major risk factors for CAD but CAG was not done. Aortic velocity propagation ranged from 46 cm/s to 76 cm/s (mean = 58.62 ± 6.46 cm/s), CIMT ranged from 0.50 mm to 0.64 mm (mean = 0.55 ± 0.03 mm). Among 100 patients who underwent CAG we found 69% had significant CAD, 13% had insignificant CAD, and 18% had normal coronaries. Those with significant CAD had significantly lower AVP (41.65 ± 4.94 cm/s) [F (2,97) = 44.05, p < 0.0001] and significantly higher CIMT (0.86 ± 0.11 mm) [F (2,97) =35.78, p < 0.0001]. AVP had significant strong negative correlation with CIMT (r = -0.836, p < 0.0001, n = 100) and SYNTAX score (r = -0.803, p < 0.0001, n = 69), while CIMT was positively correlated with SYNTAX score significantly (r = 0.828, p < 0.0001, n = 69).
3:::The mean multiplicative Q score for CD63 and CD9 expression is higher in PTs (209 and 72) compared with ANTs (154 and 24) (P = 0.0041, P = 0.0018), respectively. The Mean Q score for CD63 and CD9 expression is higher in the malignant PTs (231 and 85) compared with ANTs (129 and 25) (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0124).
3:::Moderate-to-severe PTH was reported by 21.9% of patients (29.8% in mTIH group and 14.0% in non-mTIH group B, p = 0.012) at the 12-month follow-up. The mean NRS was higher in mTIH group than in non-mTIH group throughout the follow-up period (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11 to 1.14; p < 0.05, ANCOVA). Logistic regression analysis showed that post-traumatic seizure (odds ratio, 1.520; 95% CI, 1.128-6.785; p = 0.047) and mTIH (odds ratio, 2.194; 95% CI, 1.285-8.475; p = 0.039) were independently associated with moderate-to-severe PTH at the 12-month follow-up.
3:::Eleven (64.7%) of 17 patients had concordant sPFT and sEUS findings when the cutoff for peak bicarbonate was 80 mEq/L. Six patients had discordant findings with a negative sPFT and positive sEUS. This poor concordance suggests that sEUS is an unreliable functional test. Lowering the sEUS cutoff to 70 mEq/L resulted in improved concordance (64.7% vs 70.6%). Finally, there was no significant correlation between peak bicarbonate concentrations (r = 0.47; 95% confidence interval, -0.02 to 0.79) in these 2 functional tests.
3:::Outbreaks of sarcoptic mange were found to occur in koalas from both Victoria (n = 29) and South Australia (n = 29) for the first time. The gross pathological and histopathological changes are described.
3:::Eighty-five patients completed the follow-up. Cumulative relapse rates were 50% (n = 33) at 1 year and 89.4% (n = 76) at 6 years. One-year relapse rates were lower in patients previously treated with clonazepam (P = 0.001) compared with those treated with paroxetine. Low 6-year relapse rates were associated with high Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores before treatment (P = 0.016) and previous treatment with clonazepam.
3:::The PA intervention had the largest benefit in participants with class 2 + obesity (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.48, 0.98). However, there was no statistically significant difference in benefit across obesity categories.
3:::Some 3903 studies were identified, of which 27 were selected. A total of 13 risk prediction models have been developed and directly validated. Most models were based on a UK or US population. The best performing models regarding both applicability and discrimination were the perioperative British Aneurysm Repair score (C-statistic 0·83) and the preoperative Vascular Biochemistry and Haematology Outcome Model (C-statistic 0·85), but both lacked substantial external validation.
3:::Among the 82 women with characterized α oral HPV DNA detected at baseline, 14 persisted and were detected 2 years later (17.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.9-28.5%) and was similar to the persistence of α cervical HPV (40/223; 17.7%; 95% CI, 13.1-23.9%; P = 0.86). Acquisition of new α oral HPV type was low; incident infection (1.7%; 95% CI, 0.6-3.7%).
3:::Perceived weight discrimination was associated with increased risk of cigarette smoking (odds ratio [OR] = 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36-1.99), driving while intoxicated (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.60-2.54), risky sexual/drug use behaviors (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.69-2.80), and not using a seat belt (OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.15-2.03). With the exception of seat belt use, all associations remained significant controlling for depressive symptoms.
3:::Both models discriminated between concussed and nonconcussed groups significantly above chance (with 76% and 86% accuracy, respectively). In the statistical model, patients with mean vertical sinusoidal grating response latencies greater than 119 milliseconds to 0.25-cycle/degree stimuli (or mean vertical sinusoidal latencies >113 milliseconds to 0.50-cycle/degree stimuli) and mean vertical sinusoidal grating amplitudes of less than 14.75 mV to 0.50-cycle/degree stimuli were classified as having had a history of concussion. The resultant receiver operating characteristic curve for this model had excellent discrimination between the concussed and nonconcussed (area under the curve = 0.857; P < .01) groups with sensitivity of 0.92 and specificity of 0.80.
3:::Thirty-six relevant TCM formulae were collected to illustrate the compatibility rationality of TCM from the perspective of pharmaceutics, pharmacokinetics, and/or pharmacodynamics.
3:::SSB intake (100 g/d) was associated with higher BMI (β = 0.06 kg/m(2); P = 0.001) and WC (β = 0.19 cm; P < 0.001). A linear trend with BMI and WC also was seen when SSB intake was examined as categories of servings per day (Ptrend ≤ 0.001). Replacing SSB with water, coffee/tea, or milk was inversely associated with BMI (β = -0.07 to -0.09 kg/m(2); P < 0.001) and WC (β = -0.25 to -0.28 cm; P < 0.001).
3:::PrEP awareness increased from 2011 to 2014 in both cities (DC: 39.1%-73.8% and Miami: 19.4%-41.2%), but use remained low in 2014 (DC: 7.7%; Miami: 1.4%). Being very likely to use PrEP decreased over time in DC (61%-48%), but increased in Miami (48%-60%). In DC, minority race was associated with increased odds of being very likely to use PrEP, whereas reduced odds of being very likely to use PrEP was observed for MSM with 1 or 2-5 partners versus having 6+ partners. In Miami, a higher proportion of white versus Hispanic MSM reported being very likely to use PrEP in 2011, but this observation was reversed in 2014.
3:::Analysis included data from 28,295 sexually active MSM. Overall, 49% of MSM interviewed in 2014 reported syphilis screening, a significant increase from 40% in 2011 and 38% in 2008. In 2014, syphilis screening was most commonly reported by MSM who were aged 25-29 years (56%), HIV positive (68%), and had >10 sexual partners in the past 12 months (65%). The largest increases in syphilis screening between 2008 and 2014 were among MSM aged 30-39 years (37%-52%) and MSM who reported >10 sex partners (48%-65%). Among MSM who reported syphilis screening, the diagnoses of syphilis increased from 9% in 2008 to 11% in 2014. Increases in syphilis diagnosis were observed among MSM who were aged 25-29 years (6%-10%), black (9%-14%), HIV positive (15%-21%), and reported >10 sexual partners (11%-17%).
3:::Of the 145 participants without DPN at baseline, 51 had developed DPN when examined after 4 years (35% incidence). Of the ophthalmic variables, the mean (S.D.) of the overall thickness in the parafovea at baseline was 315 (18) μm in the no DPN group and 306 (18) μm in the incidence' group, and the differences were significant, p = 0.005. The superior hemisphere parafovea (mean (S.D.): 318 (17) μm vs 310 (20) μm, p = 0.02) and inferior hemisphere parafovea (313 (19) μm vs 302 (18) μm, p = 0.002) were different in the incident DPN group compared with the no DPN group. When adjusted for age, retinal thickness in the parafovea (AUC = 0.65, p = 0.003, 86% sensitivity and 44% specificity at 321 μm criterion), and body mass index or BMI (AUC = 0.65, p = 0.003, 49% sensitivity and 83% specificity at 29.3 kg m(-2) criterion) at baseline were significant predictors for 4-year incident DPN.'
3:::Out of a sample of 96 known HIV-positive men, 59 men self-reported an undetectable HIV viral load and 9 men self-reported a detectable viral load consented to confirmatory laboratory testing. The sample of self-reported undetectable men had gradually larger proportions of higher-risk sexual practices, whereas the sample of detectable men was evenly distributed across sexual practices. This association was not statistically significant (P = 0.91).
3:::Frequent IU increased from 21% in 2008 to 44% in 2014 (APR = 1.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.36 to 1.42), and having met the last partner online increased from 19% in 2008 to 32% in 2014 (APR = 1.30, 95% confidence interval: 1.26 to 1.34). Those who never used the internet had fewer partners (median of 2 in the past 12 months, interquartile range: 1-4) compared with infrequent (4, 2-7) and frequent users (5, 3-12). HIV testing in the past 12 months also increased with increasing IU (58%, 68%, and 71%, respectively, P < 0.0001). Among HIV-positive participants, the percent HIV-positive awareness increased as IU increased (71%, 75%, and 79%, P < 0.005).
3:::The Cardiff Acuity Test over-estimated VA compared with the Lea Symbols and ETDRS charts in both focused and defocused conditions. The mean difference between the Cardiff Acuity Test and the ETDRS chart was 0.31 logMAR (95% limits of agreement (LOA) 0.10-0.52 logMAR) in focused conditions and 0.64 logMAR (95% LOA 0.25-1.05 logMAR) with 3D of spherical defocus. Defocus degraded VA on all charts, however there was a significant chart-by-defocus interaction whereby the Cardiff Acuity Test was more resistant to the effects of both spherical (P < 0.0001) and cylindrical (P < 0.001) optical defocus than the recognition acuity tasks at all defocus levels.
3:::There was a high correlation (0.93) between the percentage of reported living HIV cases attributed to male heterosexual contact and female heterosexual contact and a moderate nonsignificant correlation (0.49) between the percentage of MSM who were men who have sex with men and women (MSMW) in National HIV Behavioral Surveillance and the percentage of reported cases that were attributed to female heterosexual contact suggesting some potential overlap. Cities with high levels of poverty and African American/Black residents had higher levels of MSMW and higher levels of heterosexual female cases.
3:::Significant differences were detected in regular astigmatism, asymmetry and higher order irregularities among groups. For the SKC group, the parameters with high diagnostic ability (AUC > 90%) were the higher order irregularities, the asymmetry and the regular astigmatism, mainly in the corneal periphery. Higher predictive accuracy was identified using diagnostic models that combined the asymmetry, regular astigmatism and higher order irregularities in averaged 3and 4 mm area (AUC: 98.4%, Sensitivity: 91.7% and Specificity:100%).
3:::Of 5154 women, 11% were incarcerated within the previous year, 36% were ever incarcerated but not in the past 12 months, and 53% were never incarcerated. Prevalence of exchange sex (aPR 1.32, 1.20-1.46), multiple casual partners (aPR 1.59, 1.2-2.1), multiple casual condomless partners (aPR 1.47, 1.07-2.03), and sexually transmitted infection diagnosis (aPR 1.61, 1.34-1.93) were all higher among recently incarcerated women compared with those never incarcerated. We also found higher prevalence of recent HIV testing among women recently incarcerated (aPR 1.30, 1.18-1.43).
3:::Through 2011, over 3,038,049 person-years of follow-up, we documented 261 incident cases of CD and 321 incident cases of UC. Dietary heme iron was nonsignificantly associated with increased risk of UC (Ptrend = 0.12). This association seemed to be modified by the UC susceptibility locus, rs1801274, a coding variant in the FcγRIIA gene (Pinteraction = 7.00E-05). In contrast, there was no association between dietary heme iron and risk of CD (Ptrend = 0.67). We also did not observe an association between total dietary intake of iron and risk of CD or UC (All Ptrend > 0.35).
3:::Tracheal epithelial tissue derived from tdTomato-labeled iPSCs survived in the tracheal defects. Moreover, immunochemical analyses showed that differentiated tissues had epithelial structures similar to those of proximal tracheal tissues.
3:::Subjects wore the blue-blocking glasses 3:57 ± 1:03 h each night. After the experimental period, the pupil showed a slower redilation phase, resulting in a significantly increased 30 s post illumination pupil response to one-second short wavelength light, and decreased area under the curve for one and five-second short wavelength light, when measured at the same time of day as baseline. Night time melatonin increased from 16.1 ± 7.5 pg mL(-1) to 25.5 ± 10.7 pg mL(-1) (P < 0.01). Objectively measured sleep duration increased 24 min, from 408.7 ± 44.9 to 431.5 ± 42.9 min (P < 0.001). Mean PSQI score improved from 5.6 ± 2.9 to 3.0 ± 2.2.
3:::At Node 47005, maximum X-displacement was 5.073 mm corresponding to the incisal edge of the upper central incisor. At Node 3971, maximum negative Y-displacement was -0.86 mm which corresponds to the anterior zygomatic arch, indicating posterior movement of craniofacial complex. At Node 32324, maximum negative Z-displacement was -0.92 mm representing the anterior and deepest convex portion of the nasal septum; indicating downward displacement of structures medial to the area of force application.
3:::The prevalence of neck pain was 20.3% (95% CI 17.3-23.7). The adjusted analyses showed that individuals who were widowers or separated (PR=2.26; 1.42-5.88), had a low income (PR=1.32; 1.22-6.27) or low educational level (PR=1.83; 1.02-5.26), worked while sitting and leaning (PR=1.55; 1.08-2.40), and who reported having two or more diseases (PR=1.71; 1.55-6.31) remained associated with neck pain.
3:::Fourteen patients were included (11 right-handers, 2 left-handers, 1 ambidextrous). The sex-ratio male/female was 0.27 and the average age of 58.1±10.4 years. The main CVRF were age and smoking. In the UL, 42.8% of patients had a history of trophic disorders, Allen maneuver was abnormal for 35.7% of the superficial palmar arch, 42.9% of ulnar pulse were not perceived and there was no recordable flow in 25% of ulnar artery. In the LL, 14.3% of patients had already presented trophic disorders toes, Allen maneuver was abnormal for 15.4% of the posterior tibial artery, 25.6% of posterior tibial pulse were not perceived and flow of 15.4% of posterior tibial arteries was pathological.
3:::The median ages of the 3 cohorts were 81 years (elderly, 80-92 years), 71 years (intermediate, 65-79 years), and 58 years (younger, 20-64 years). The elderly cohort was more likely to have cardiac comorbidities. Although the clinical complete response (cCR) rate deviated significantly among the 3 cohorts, (78%, 72%, and 56%; P=.004), the data failed to identify statistically significant differences among RFS, 2-year, and 5-year OS, or in median survival, which was 15.5 months, 23.6 months, and 20.2 months (P=.468), respectively. The overall severe toxicity rates were 38%, 32%, and 30%, respectively (P=.644), including comparable rate of radiation pneumonitis (P>.05). The elderly cohort, however, did show statistically significant evidence of an increased rate of severe radiation pneumonitis (grade ≥3) which was observed to be 11% versus 4% and 0%, respectively (P=.003).
3:::Strong unmatched U.S. seniors submitted significantly more applications to achieve and attend approximately the same number of interviews as strong matched U.S. seniors. Strong unmatched seniors ranked fewer programs than their matched counterparts. As a group, unmatched U.S. seniors were less likely than their matched counterparts to rank a mix of competitive and less competitive programs and more likely to rank programs based on their perceived likelihood of matching. A small number of unmatched U.S. seniors would have matched if they had ranked programs that ranked them.
3:::The total V-V angle in the ACL-deficient knee under 5 Nm of V-V torque was significantly greater than that in the intact knee, whereas the angle in the ACL-deficient knee with 30 N of posterior tibial load was significantly smaller than that in the ACL-deficient knee and approached that in the intact knee, at both 30° and 60° of flexion. The in situ force of the ACL was approximately 30 N at 30° and 16 N at 60° of flexion under 5 Nm of both varus and valgus torques.
3:::The prevalence of low KIDMED score was significantly higher in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis compared with other groups; poor adherence to the MD correlated with liver damage, the NAFLD activity score >5, and grade 2 fibrosis. Moreover, in patients with poor adherence to the MD, higher values of C-reactive protein, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and homeostatic model assessment of β cell function were observed.
3:::ARV use was 58% (319/548) in 2009, 67% (410/608) in 2012, and 71% (386/545) in 2015. In all 3 cycle years, a higher percentage of ARV treatment was observed among males, PWID of older age (≥50), and PWID with current health insurance. ARV use increased overall, with an adjusted relative increase of 8% per every 3-year increase in year (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.03 to 1.12). ARV use also increased among most subgroups.
3:::Numerous treatment options have been described for metacarpal fractures, including splinting, percutaneous fixation, open reduction with internal fixation, and external fixation. All modalities are acceptable strategies for treating metacarpal fractures. The ultimate goal is to maximize hand function with minimal morbidity.
3:::Over a 36-month period, 42 patients met inclusion criteria (one man and 41 women), with an average age of 35 ± 11.4 years (range, 20 to 60 years). Comorbidities included four active smokers, two patients with hypertension, and one patient with diabetes. Average body mass index was 29 ± 4.4 kg/m (range, 22 to 38 kg/m). Procedures performed abroad included abdominoplasty (n = 28), liposuction (n = 20), buttock augmentation (n = 10), and breast augmentation (n = 7), with several patients undergoing combined procedures. Eleven patients presented with abscesses and eight presented with wound dehiscence. Eight of the 18 patients who were surveyed were not pleased with their results and 11 would not go abroad again for subsequent procedures. Average cost of treating the complications was $18,211, with an estimated cost to the U.S. health care system of $1.33 billion. The main payer group was Medicaid.
3:::Eighteen RCTs published between 1985 and 2013 involving 1143 patients were included. Dosage of ω-3 PUFAs used was 2.1 to 9.1 g/d, with study durations of 12 to 52 wk. Ten studies supported the hypothesis that there is a reduction in patient or physician assessment of pain associated with RA after intake of ω-3 PUFAs. Eight studies found no statistically significant effect of ω-3 PUFAs on arthritic pain.
3:::On average, the oxygen-sensing paint-on bandage measured a decrease in transdermal oxygenation from 85.2 mmHg to 64.1 mmHg upon aortic ligation. The oxygen-sensing dye restored at 81.2 mmHg after unclamping. Responses in both control groups demonstrated a similar trend. Physiologic changes from normal to ischemic and reperfused conditions were statistically significantly different in all three techniques (p < 0.001).
3:::Of the 113 digits with Dupuytrens contracture operated on during this period, 52 involved the middle fingers (12 long and 40 ring fingers). Intrinsic muscles were found to be involved in the contracture of 14 of these digits. Two unique contracture patterns were identified: type I contracture, which involves a lateral digital cord originating from intrinsic muscle-tendon units and contracting only the proximal interphalangeal joint; and type II contracture, which involves a spiral cord receiving contribution from intrinsic muscle-tendon units and contracting both the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. The frequency of type I and type II contractures was 6 percent and 12 percent, respectively.'
3:::REEc1, REEc2, and REEc3 explained 54% (P < 0.001), 56% (P < 0.001), and 58% (P < 0.001) of REEm variance in all participants, respectively. However, REEc2 showed mean difference between REEm (P < 0.001), and REEc3 showed trends in estimating the REE (P < 0.05). In contrast, REEc1 showed limits of agreement (95%) of -248.3 to 285.8 kcal/d, 18.7 ± 136.3 kcal/d of bias, and no trends in the Bland-Altman analysis. The relationship between all predicted models and measured REE decreased in LW and LWH.
3:::One hundred forty-two patients were enrolled. There was significant (all p < 0.05) and progressive reduction in fat graft retention within the first 3 postoperative months, and the retained fat graft was maintained (all p > 0.05) from 3 to 12 months postoperatively, with a 12-month fat graft retention rate of 67.7 percent. Age, Parry-Romberg syndrome, previous craniofacial bone surgery, grafted volume, and forehead unit were independently negative (all p < 0.05) predictors of fat graft retention, whereas cheek unit was an independently positive (all p < 0.05) predictor of retention.
3:::Forty-nine participants completed the trial in each group. Supplementation was well tolerated. Forty-five URTIs were confirmed: 28 in the placebo group and 17 in the Wellmune group (odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-1.26; P = 0.149). There was a strong trend for Wellmune to decrease the number of symptom days (P = 0.067). Symptom severity did not differ significantly between groups. Compared with the placebo group, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated blood from participants in the Wellmune group showed an increase in interferon-γ concentration from baseline at day 45 (P = 0.016) and smaller decreases in monokine induced by interferon-γ concentration from baseline at days 45 and 90 (P = 0.032 and 0.046, respectively). No difference was seen in serum or nonstimulated blood cytokines and chemokines or in salivary immunoglobulin A.
3:::The in vivo study of young, growing mice showed that chronic MBP intake for 3 wk increased the plasma ghrelin concentration and bone mineral density of the hind limb tibia. In vitro studies using minced rat gastric mucosa tissues and primary murine isolated gastric mucosal cells revealed that MBP stimulated ghrelin release in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, MBP-induced ghrelin secretion was partly inhibited by adrenergic blockers.
3:::One hundred one patients met inclusion criteria, of which 57.4 percent were male. Average age at the time of the most recent speech evaluation was 6.1 years (range, 2.31 to 17.95 years); 43.6 percent had normal speech/language metrics and 56.4 percent had one or more abnormalities, including anatomical motor delay/disorder (29.7 percent), language acquisition delay/disorder (21.8 percent), articulation or speech production delay/disorder (4.0 percent), hypernasality (15.8 percent), and velopharyngeal insufficiency or borderline competency (23.8 percent). Average Pittsburgh Weighted Speech Scale score was 1.3 (range, 0 to 5), and 29.7 percent (n = 30) of patients were recommended to have speech therapy. In addition, 25.8 percent of patients were diagnosed with a submucous cleft palate.
3:::The cardioprotective effect was observed in SND pretreatment groups, especially in low dosage SND group. The results of serum enzyme activities and histopathology were consistent with the above effect. Meanwhile, fifteen latent biomarker candidates were identified involving glucose, phospholipid, bile acid and amino acid metabolisms. Among them, five bile acids including ursodeoxycholic acid, murideoxycholic acid, muricholic acid, hyodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid, were for the first time identified as latent pathological biomarkers related to ISO-induced myocardial injury. Further, different dose SND groups exerted different of inhibition degrees to the activation of NF-κB, which was obvious in the SND-L group.
3:::From a total of 202 patients submitted to pleurodesis (47% men; mean age 66.9±12.02 years). Lights criteria identified 86.6% as exudates. We found 85.1% survival at 30-day post-pleurodesis, which means the therapy used has significant success. A logistic regression model applied explained that variance in post-pleurodesis events was mostly due to age and gender rather than pleural biochemical factors (X(2)(5)=44.648, p<0.001, R(2) 28.3%).'
3:::The mean age of the study population was 47.8 ± 10.8 years. Qatari women and Arab women constituted 64.7% and 35.3% of the study population, respectively. The mean 5-year and lifetime breast cancer risks were 1.12 ± 0.52 and 10.57 ± 3.1, respectively. Consanguineous marriage among parents was seen in 30.6% of participants. We found a relationship between the 5-year and lifetime risks of breast cancer and variables such as age, age at menarche, gravidity, parity, body mass index, family history of cancer, menopause age, occupation, and level of education. The linear regression analysis identified the predictors for breast cancer in women such as age, age at menarche, age of first birth, family history and age of menopausal were considered the strong predictors and significant contributing risk factors for breast cancer after adjusting for ethnicity, parity and other variables.
3:::Thirty-five participants (64.8%) completed the entire study protocol (received a study medication and completed 14- and 45-day follow-ups). Among those who received a study medication (n = 45), 77.8% completed all follow-up interviews. This pilot study was not designed to have sufficient statistical power for hypothesis testing, and thus, as expected, there were no significant differences between groups in medication adherence (self-report of >80% of daily doses taken in oral group; receipt of second injection in the injection group), treatment engagement (at least treatment 3 visits in the 30 days postdischarge, and 2 or more visits per month in each of the 3 months following discharge) or alcohol consumption at 14 or at 45 days (p > 0.05). The median number of drinks among the entire cohort in the 2 weeks prior to hospitalization (128 drinks) was significantly higher than at day 14 (0 drinks, p < 0.001) or day 45 (0 drinks, p < 0.001). Rates of medication adherence were 62% in the oral group and 61% in the injection group.
3:::A significant correlation was evident between SLH and COH (r=0.861, P=0.003) and SLH and TH (r=0.908, P=0.001). The correlational analyses of SEBT revealed a significant relationship between the posteromedial and posterolateral direction of the SEBT (r=0.943, P<0.001). SEBT and SLHT showed no correlation.
3:::All PET/MR examinations had good or excellent image quality and were deemed clinically acceptable. There was substantial agreement of PET image quality among readers of PET/MR images. Per patient, PET/MR and PET/CT had complete concordance in identifying active disease. PET/MRI correctly classified 74 (96%) of 77 foci of disease identified on PET/CT. The per-lesion maximum SUVs were strongly correlated between modalities with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.73 (P < 0.001).
3:::One hundred forty-five (17.8%) surveys were collected. Significant differences were observed between tertiary hospitals and secondary or private hospitals in terms of appropriate (according to European Society of Gynaecologic Oncology guidelines) nodal staging in low-risk cases (96 [95%] vs 27 [61.4%], respectively; P < 0.001), appropriate nodal staging in intermediate-risk cases (96 [95%] vs 39 [88.6%], respectively; P = 0.004), appropriate treatment in advanced-stage cases (63 [67.7%] vs 13 [40.6%], respectively; P < 0.001), and surgical treatment of relapses (87 [93.5%] vs 18 [56.3%], respectively; P = 0.004) but nonsignificant in the rate of complete paraaortic lymphadenectomy performance (82 [81.2%] vs 28 [63.6%], respectively; P = 0.056). Similar results have been observed when comparing centers with less than 20 cases per year to centers with more than 40 cases annually, with significant differences in the management of low-risk and intermediate-risk endometrial cancers.
3:::Among 350 robotic-assisted hysterectomies for endometrial cancer, 187 (53%) underwent attempted sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. At least 1 SLN was detected in 185, a 99% overall detection rate; 108 (58%) also had non-SLNs removed. Among 91 patients with SLNs and non-SLNs from the ipsilateral hemipelvis, both were negative in 74 (81%) and positive in 7 (8%), and 10 (11%) had a positive SLN with negative non-SLNs. Among 17 patients with SLNs and non-SLNs from the contralateral hemipelvis, both were negative in 12 (71%), both were positive in 3 (18%), and 2 patients (12%) had negative SLNs with contralateral positive non-SLNs. Among 79 patients with only a SLN dissection, 4 (5%) were positive; among 69 patients with only a non-SLN dissection, 14 (20%) had positive lymph nodes. Among 24 patients with metastatic SLNs, 9 (38%) had isolated tumor cells, 3 (13%) had micrometastases, and 12 (50%) had macrometastases. Among the 40 total patients with metastatic lymph nodes, low-volume metastases represented the largest metastatic deposit in one third of patients, all of which had SLN dissection. All 12 with low-volume metastases had endometrioid histology compared with less than half (46%) of those with macrometastases (P < 0.01). Grade 1 carcinoma was present in 7 (58%) of the patients with low-volume metastases compared with 4 (14%) of those with macrometastases (P < 0.01) Furthermore, significantly more patients with low-volume metastases versus macrometastases had less than 50% myometrial invasion (67% vs 4%, P < 0.001).
3:::The IC50 (concentration by which 50% cell growth was inhibited) was 20 μM for paclitaxel alone, 1.5 μg/mL for MAP2K6-FP alone, and 0.3 μg/mL for MAP2K6-FP and 15 μM for paclitaxel if combined, respectively. In addition, immunohistochemistry assay demonstrated that tumor tissues from ovarian cancer patients showed higher expression of LC-3, the autophagy-related protein, compared with normal ovarian tissues. MAP2K6-FP (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 μg/mL) dose-dependently increased the LC-3 expression in HO8910 cells. Immunofluorescence assay showed that paclitaxel alone increased the expression of LC-3 in HO8910 cells, which was further enhanced by the combination with MAP2K6-FP. Downregulation of LC-3 expression using LC-3 small interfering RNA inhibited the cytotoxicity effect of MAP2K6-FP. Furthermore, either MAP2K6-FP alone or in combination with paclitaxel increased the ratio of expressions of Beclin-1/Bcl-2, another autophagy-related markers, compared with paclitaxel alone.
3:::The three patients were characterized by a steady clinical worsening not controlled by maraviroc. All the three patients manifested PML-IRIS, which emerged, respectively, at 62, 64 and 90days post NTZ withdrawal. This is in accordance with the data of the Italian dataset. Clinical and radiological stabilization of PML-IRIS occurred only after corticosteroids administration.
3:::Low expression of miR-200c-5p and remarkable overexpression of MAD2L1 was uncovered in HCC tissues and cells compared with the normal. The aberrant expression of miR-200c-5p and MAD2L1 was correlated with tumor stage, adjacent organ invasion and prognosis. Direct target relationship between miR-200c-5p and MAD2L1 was confirmed by dual luciferase reporting assay. Up-regulation of miR-200c-5p downregulated MAD2L1 and suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of HCC cells. Moreover, MAD2L1 promoted HCC cell viabilities and co-transfection of MAD2L1 restored the anti-tumor effects of miR-200c-5p overexpression.
3:::The 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates in group A were 100%, 33% and 24% in group A and 47%, 7% and 0% in group B (p<0.001). In addition, complete tumor resection (p<0.001) and tumor grade III (p<0.001) were associated with improved survival.
3:::The overall performance of HFD was similar to UC. In miRNA yield, both HFD and UC can meet the needs of further analysis. The level of miR-145 in UEVs was significantly increased in patients with PCa compared with the patients with BPH (P = 0.018). In addition, significant increase was observed in miR-145 levels when patients with Gleason score ≥8 tumors compared with Gleason score ≤7 (P = 0.020). Receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) revealed that miR-145 in UEVs combined with serum PSA could differentiate PCa from BPH better than PSA alone (AUC 0.863 and AUC 0.805, respectively). In serum EVs, four miRNAs were significantly higher in patients with PCa than with BPH.
3:::From the qualitative analysis, two major categories (direct and indirect factors) for cancer risks emerged based on participant notions of cancer risk and cancer prevention behaviors as they relate to firefighting.
3:::The study population consisted of 6,983 individuals, which included 927 switchers (168 virologically stable; 55 virologically+clinically stable), who were matched with replacement with 18,511 nonswitcher comparators. The switcher cohort was 88.8% male (mean age 43.8 years). Mean preindex and follow-up treatment durations for switchers and nonswitchers were 1.8 years and 1.5 years, respectively; demographic characteristics, pre-index treatment duration, and follow-up duration were similar between cohorts. Significantly more nonswitchers than switchers had a first-line efavirenz-based regimen (67.2% vs. 47.8%, P < 0.001). In the virologically stable subset, follow-up annualized health care utilization for switchers versus nonswitchers, respectively, was 14.8 versus 12.3 ambulatory visits (P < 0.05), 0.8 versus 0.9 emergency department visits (P = 0.652), and 0.05 versus 0.05 inpatient hospitalizations (P = 0.915). Follow-up annualized health care costs were $37,120 for switchers versus $31,771 for nonswitchers (P < 0.05), with the difference driven largely by pharmacy costs. Multivariable-adjusted follow-up annualized health care costs were 8.9% higher among switchers versus nonswitchers (P < 0.01), and switchers also had a shorter time to subsequent ART regimen change (P < 0.001). Results were similar for the virologically+clinically stable subset.
3:::Among 3704 workers living in Washington State after 1991, when cancer registry case accrual began, 516 first primary diagnoses occurred through 2007. While overall cancer incidence was significantly reduced [SIR: 0.83 (0.76, 0.90)], internal comparisons suggest an association with exposure comparing high to low exposed person-time [SRR: 1.28 (1.05, 1.55)].
3:::The percentage values of FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s), FVC (forced vital capacity) and MVV (maximal voluntary ventilation) showed significant improvement between the two examinations in the early adolescent period. In adulthood, FEV1%pred (percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s) showed no statistically significant difference. The mean values of both FVC and FVC%pred (percentage predicted forced vital capacity) for the preterm-born group were lower than for the reference group, but this was not statistically significant. The preterm-born group showed lower values of such parameters as forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of FVC, MEF25 (maximal expiratory flow at 25% of forced vital capacity) and FEV1/FVC as compared with the reference group, but again without statistical significance.
3:::In 2011, 10% of all fee-for-service dual eligible patients aged less than 65 years in Massachusetts were seen at Boston Medical Center. Data before propensity score matching showed significant differences in age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, employment, physical comorbidities, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score between patients with and without behavioral health illness. Analysis after propensity score matching found significant differences in sex, Hispanic race, and other education and employment status. Compared with patients without behavioral health illness, patients with behavioral health illness had a higher RR for hospital admissions (RR = 2.07; 95% CI = 1.81-2.38; P < 0.001) and ED use (RR = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.46-1.77; P < 0.001). Results were robust after adjusting for characteristics that remained statistically significantly different after propensity score matching.
3:::The results showed that DHM could inhibit the activity of CYP3A4, CYP2E1 and CYP2D6, with IC50 values of 14.75, 25.74 and 22.69 μM, respectively, but that other CYP isoforms were not affected. Enzyme kinetic studies showed that DHM was not only a non-competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 but also a competitive inhibitor of CYP2E1 and CYP2D6, with Ki values of 6.06, 9.24 and 10.52 μM, respectively. In addition, DHM is a time-dependent inhibitor for CYP3A4 with KI/Kinact value of 12.17/0.057 min(-1 )μM(-1).
3:::NO generation and iNOS induction were increased in the LPS-activated mouse peritoneal macrophages. However, NO generation and iNOS induction by LPS were suppressed by treatment with OJ for the first time. The IC50 value of OJ with respect to NO production was 0.09 mg/mL. OJ did not influence LPS-stimulated COX-2 induction, but did significantly decrease LPS-stimulated secretions and mRNA expressions of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β. Inhibition rates of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β at an OJ concentration of 1 mg/mL were 77%, 88%, and 50%, respectively. OJ also suppressed the LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB. High-performance liquid chromatography showed schizandrin and gomisin A are major components of OJ.
3:::Cases in all age groups in both databases had more diagnoses annually than controls (mean =9-17 per year vs. 4-10 per year, P < 0.001), and the number of diagnoses decreased with age for cases and controls. Among the most common case diagnoses were upper respiratory infections (28.9%-59.1% vs. 19.5%-52.9%); suppurative otitis media (25.1%-56.8% vs. 8.7%-51.2%); nutrition/metabolic/developmental symptoms (37.9%-50.4% vs. 7.7%-10.6%); delays in development (22.8%-52.8% vs. 4.1%-10.9%); and general symptoms (35.1%-47.2% vs. 22.1%-37.2%), and the prevalence of each was greater among cases versus controls in all age groups in both databases (P < 0.001). The most common diagnoses among controls included some of the same as among cases, as well as acute pharyngitis (18.7%-31.8% vs. 19.2%-30.5%); allergic rhinitis (19.9%-24.3% vs. 15.3%-20.7%); viral/chlamydial infections (24.2%-26.6% vs. 17.7%-23.5%); and joint disorders (11.6% vs. 16.6%), and most were significantly more prevalent among cases (P < 0.05).
3:::We found a significant difference between men and women regarding the maximum height, maximum width, maximum A-P diameter of sinuses and the maximum distance between the right and left maxillary sinuses in all of our participants. We also found that the highest accuracy for sex determination was related to the maximum distance between the sinuses (65.6%) and the lowest to the maximum width of the right sinus (56.2%). The most accurate identification resulted from assessing the maximum distance between the sinuses in the 20-34 age group (74.3%), the maximum anterior-posterior diameter of the sinuses in the 35-49 age group (62.8%) and the maximum height of the left sinus in the over 50 age group (65.7%).
3:::Key informants (n=23) noted that services for patients with gynecologic cancers are provided through a combination of VA and community care with wide variation in care arrangements by facility. Care coordination challenges included care fragmentation, lack of role clarity and care tracking, and difficulties associated with VA and community provider communication, patient communication, patient records exchange, and authorizations. Care coordination roles suggested for addressing challenges included: care tracker, provider point-of-contact, patient liaison, and records administrator.
3:::Of 59,411 women who completed the prevalence screener, 5,879 women (9.9%) met the inclusion criteria for completing the survey; 1,318 women (2.2%) reported endometriosis and at least 1 hour of scheduled household chores in the past 7 days. Of these, 810 women had least 1 hour of scheduled employment in the past 7 days. Mean age was 34.6 years (standard error [SE] ± 0.32); 77.2% of the women were white; 59.3% were married or in a civil union; and 59.1% were employed full or part time. Women with endometriosis had a weekly loss of an average of 5.3 hours (SE ± 0.4) because of employment presenteeism, 1.1 hours (SE ± 0.2) of employment absenteeism, 2.3 (SE ± 0.2) hours of household presenteeism, and 2.5 (SE ± 0.2) hours of household absenteeism. Hourly losses in employment and household chore productivity were significantly greater with increasing symptom severity (mild vs. severe: 1.9 vs. 15.8 total employment hours lost and 2.5 vs. 10.1 total household hours lost; P < 0.0001). Women who experienced 3 endometriosis symptoms concurrently lost a significantly greater number of employment hours because of absenteeism and presenteeism compared with those experiencing 1 or 2 symptoms (P < 0.001). Regression analyses showed that a range of endometriosis symptoms predicted employment and household losses because of presenteeism and absenteeism.
3:::Among those with hypertension, the full implementation of the ACA (year 2014) is associated with a greater likelihood of being insured, but the race/ethnicity interaction indicates that this gain is less substantial for Mexican-heritage Latinos. The odds of having a usual source of care other than the emergency department increased after the passage of the ACA, and interaction effects indicate that this gain was more substantial for Mexican-heritage Latinos. The odds of having any physician visit and taking blood pressure mediations decreased among non-Latino whites but increased among Mexican-heritage Latinos.
3:::From 1992 to 2015, 1023 patients were identified, of whom 613 (60%) recurred at a median follow-up of 50 months. CRS was well validated in that all 3 factors remained independent predictors of recurrence beyond MC (hazard ratio 1.5-2.1, all P < 0.001) and accurately stratified recurrence risk beyond MC, ranging from 19% (CRS 0) to 67% (CRS 3) at 5 years. Among patients with CRS 0, no other factors were significantly associated with recurrence beyond MC. The majority recurred within 2 years. After 2 years of recurrence-free survival, the cumulative risk of recurrence beyond MC within the next 5 years for all patients was 14%. This risk was 12% for patients with initial disease within MC and 17% for patients with initial disease beyond MC.
3:::Lower nadir PaO2 values were associated with postoperative stroke, with estimated odds of stroke increasing over 20% (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.41) per 10 mm Hg lower nadir PaO2, and similarly increased odds of stroke per lower quartile of nadir PaO2 (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.19-2.16). When average PaO2 was considered, odds of stroke was also increased (adjusted OR, 1.39 per lower quartile of mean PaO2; 95% CI, 1.05-1.83). Having a nadir PaO2 value in the lowest versus any other quartile was associated with an estimated 2.41-fold increased odds of stroke (95% CI, 1.22-4.78). Quartile of nadir but not average PaO2 results remained significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons.
3:::In all, 83 patients were analyzed with median (interquartile ranges) age 8 (4-12) and Injury Severity Score 22 (13-34), 73.5% blunt mechanism, 47% severe TBI, 20.5% massively transfused. Outcomes were 14.5% mortality, 43.7% disability, and 9.8% deep vein thrombosis. Remaining in or trending to SD was associated with death (P = 0.007), disability (P = 0.012), and deep vein thrombosis (P = 0.048). Median LY30 was lower on post-trauma day (PTD)1 to PTD4 in patients with poor compared with good outcome; median LY30 was lower on PTD1 to PTD3 in TBI patients compared with non-TBI patients. HF without associated shutdown was not related to poor outcome, but extreme HF (LY30 >30%, n = 3) was lethal. Also, 50% of massively transfused patients in hemorrhagic shock demonstrated SD physiology on admission. All with HF (fc31.2%) corrected after hemostatic resuscitation without tranexamic acid.
3:::According to the non-inferiority analysis and a pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -24%, the APPAC did not demonstrate non-inferiority of antibiotics vs. appendectomy. Significantly, however, the operations were nearly always open, whereas the majority of appendectomies in the United States are done laparoscopically; and laparoscopic and open appendectomies are not equivalent operations. Treatment with antibiotics is efficacious more than 70% of the time. However, a switch to an antimicrobial-only approach may result in a greater probability of antimicrobial-associated collateral damage, both to the host patient and to antibiotic susceptibility patterns. A surgery-only approach would result in a reduction in antibiotic exposure, a consideration in these days of focus on antimicrobial stewardship.
3:::Students who received brief individual CBT displayed a significant reduction in their homesickness and depression scores compared to the scores of students in the control group. Students who experienced only homesickness exhibited a significant reduction in the scores on homesickness in the post-assessment compared to the control groups post-assessment homesickness scores.'
3:::Seventy-five patients participated in this study, with a response rate of 88%. Self-reported questionnaires indicated that 31% and 11% of patients were identified as probable for having anxiety and depression, respectively. The level of agreement between the patient and gastroenterologist as to the presence of anxiety or depression was fair to moderate (kappa statistic 0.32 and 0.41, respectively). In only 50% of cases was further action taken by gastroenterologists during consultation for distressed patients, mostly in the form of a patient discussion.
3:::In Study 1, a 15-item two-factor structure was identified. A 10-item two-factor structure was confirmed in Study 2. Results also indicated that the MSCRQ has acceptable levels of reliability, and good concurrent and incremental validity.
3:::Rg1 significantly decreased the immobility time of mice in FST and TST. Furthermore, Rg1 alleviated anhedonia and hopelessness, decreased serum corticosterone level, and increased serum testosterone level, and the GR protein level in the PFC and hippocampus of the CUMS-treated rats. Moreover, Rg1 improved sleep disruption, down-regulated the serum corticosterone level, and increased AR protein level in the PFC of the GDX-treated mice.
3:::There were no significant differences in outcome between patients with and without prior APT after adjustment for baseline characteristics and management factors during the first week; defined by mRS scores 2 to 6 (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-1.26; P=0.953), 3 to 6 (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.75-1.20; P=0.662), or ordinal mRS shift (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.87-1.21; P=0.770). Alteplase-treated patients on prior APT had higher symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.00-3.30; P=0.051) according to the safe implementation of thrombolysis in stroke-monitoring study definition. Although not significant (P-trend, 0.053), low-dose alteplase tended to have better outcomes than standard-dose alteplase in those on prior APT compared with those not using APT (mRS scores of 2-6; OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.62-1.12 versus OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.99-1.36).
3:::From a total of 53 relevant studies including 1853 patients, only 1021 patients undergoing 35 different total aortic arch procedures were found eligible for further evaluation and included in group I, II, or III (429, 190, and 402 patients, respectively). Overall early mortality was higher in group I vs groups II and III (P = .001; 1 - β = 95.6%) but exceeded in group III (18.6%) and group II (14.0%) vs group I (8.0%; P = .044; 1 - β = 57.4%) for diseases involving zone 0. Mortality was higher in all subgroups treated for zone 0 disease compared with corresponding subgroups treated for zone I to zone III disease. The incidence of cerebral ischemic events was increased in groups I and II vs group III (7.5% and 11% vs 1.7%; P = .0001) and correlated with early mortality (R(2) = .20; P = .033). The incidence of type II endoleaks and endovascular reintervention was similar between groups and correlated with each other (R(2) = .37; P = .004). Type Ia endoleak occurred more often in groups II and III than in group I (7.1% and 12.1% vs 5.8%; P = .023) and correlated with midterm mortality (R(2) = .53; P = .005). Retrograde type A dissection was low in all groups, whereas aneurysm growth was higher in group III (2.6%, 4.2%, 10.7%; P = .002), correlating with midterm mortality (R(2) = .311; P = .009). Surgical revision slightly correlated with surgical complications (R(2) = .18; P = .044) but not with mortality (R(2) = .10; P = .214).
3:::One hundred twenty-three participants were assigned to rhythm-and-music therapy (n=41), horse-riding therapy (n=41), or control (n=41). Post-intervention, the perception of stroke recovery (mean change from baseline on a scale ranging from 1 to 100) was higher among rhythm-and-music therapy (5.2 [95% confidence interval, 0.79-9.61]) and horse-riding therapy participants (9.8 [95% confidence interval, 6.00-13.66]), compared with controls (-0.5 [-3.20 to 2.28]); P=0.001 (1-way ANOVA). The improvements were sustained in both intervention groups 6 months later, and corresponding gains were observed for the secondary outcomes.
3:::Heat maps and picto-trendlines were evaluated more positively than dot maps. Heat maps were more effective than picto-trendlines and no different from dot maps at increasing interest in vaccination, perceived risk of contracting disease, and interest in additional information about the disease. Heat maps and picto-trendlines were more successful at conveying knowledge than dot maps. Overall, heat maps were the only graphic to be superior in every outcome.
3:::In cross-sectional analyses, decreased ABI was not significantly associated with RLS as outcome in multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for several potential confounders (BiDirect: odds ratio (OR) = 1.07 for a -0.1 change in ABI, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81-1.42, p = 0.62; SHIP-2: OR = 0.99, CI: 0.85-1.16, p = 0.94; SHIP-Trend: OR = 0.99, CI: 0.87-1.13, p = 0.88). Similar non-significant results were achieved using PAD (instead of ABI) as an independent variable. In BiDirect, baseline ABI was not a significant predictor of incident RLS in longitudinal analysis (OR = 0.77, CI: 0.53-1.12, p = 0.17).
3:::There appears to be a higher responsiveness of PC when doctors are paid via capitation than when they only receive a fee for services or a mixed payment method. In addition, countries that spend more on health services are associated with higher levels of dignity and autonomy.
3:::In transfected cells, a total of 748 biotinylated proteins were identified from cells expressing biotin ligase-tagged K-Ras variants. Significant differences were observed between membrane-associated variants and a farnesylation-defective mutant. In pancreatic cancer cells, 56 K-Ras interaction partners were identified. Most of these were cytoskeletal or plasma membrane proteins, and many have been identified previously as potential cancer biomarkers.
3:::Most factorial parameters of the ISI remained invariant after CBT-I. However, the factorial model of the PSQI changed after CBT-I treatment. An extra loading with three residual correlations was added into the factorial model after treatment.
3:::In total, 113 proteins were found differentially expressed between the normal and the cervical cancer lines. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the actin cytoskeleton signaling pathway to be significantly affected, while up-regulation of cofilin-1, an actin depolymerizing factor, was documented and further validated by western blotting. Furthermore, two-way comparisons among the four cell lines, revealed a set of 18 informative differentially expressed proteins.
3:::Nine studies, including 488 samples were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled OR of T-cadherin promoter methylation in cancer tissues was 16.73 (95%CI=6.24-44.87), 19.48 (95%CI=5.64-67.31) and 2.23 (95%CI=1.05-4.75) compared to normal tissues, adjacent tissues and premalignant tissues, respectively. The relationship between T-cadherin promoter methylation and clinicopathological features were also analyzed. However, a significant association was not observed between T-cadherin promoter methylation status and gender, tumor stage, and lymph node status (p>0.05).
3:::Hippocampal atrophy was associated with higher Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores (r = -0.4, p = 0.0408) and higher arousal indices (r = -0.4, p = 0.0332). Local volume loss of the putamen was associated with higher arousal indices (r = -0.5, p = 0.0416). Atrophic change of subcortical structures including the hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, and thalamus, correlated negatively with verbal fluency, frontal function, verbal memory, and visual memory, respectively, in these patients (|r| ≥ 0.3, p < 0.05).
3:::More than 8,600 patients in several surgical and medical populations, including joint replacement, cervical spine surgery, and congestive heart failure, have been supported by Care Link. For example, preoperative assessment of patients with elective joint replacement to predict post-acute care needs led to an increase in the volume of patients discharged to home with self-care or with home health care by 30%-from 61% to 80%.
3:::In Study 201, mean (standard deviation) changes in MWT sleep latency were 12.7 (10.6) min with JZP-110 versus 0.9 (6.0) min with placebo (P = 0.0002) for 40-min data, and 8.9 (6.3) versus 0.4 (4.6) min for 20-min censored data (P < 0.0001). In Study 202, mean changes in MWT sleep latency were 12.8 (10.3) min with JZP-110 versus 2.1 (7.9) min with placebo (P < 0.0001) for 40-min data, and 8.9 (5.5) versus 1.1 (5.6) min for 20-min censored data (P < 0.0001). In Studies 201 and 202, respectively, Cohens d effect sizes were large and numerically greater for 20-min censored data (1.54 and 1.41) versus 40-min data (1.37 and 1.17).'
3:::Unsteadiness was independently associated with an increased risk of all outcomes at follow-up after adjusting for sociodemographic variables, and physical, mental, and cognitive health (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] range 1.49-2.29; P < .05). All associations were attenuated after adjusting for usual gait speed but remained consistent in direction. The association was strongest for fear-related activity restriction [IRR = 1.82 (1.21-2.73); P < .01]. There was also evidence of an association between unsteadiness and an increased risk of activity restriction in adults who did not report FOF at baseline [IRR = 1.99 (1.10-3.61); P < .05].
3:::In total, 18,890 dabigatran patients were matched to corresponding warfarin patients. Compared to warfarin users, dabigatran users PPPM had significantly fewer all-cause hospitalizations (0.04 vs 0.05), total outpatient visits (3.98 vs 5.87), and lower 30-day readmissions (14.5% vs 17.4%, all p < 0.001). Dabigatran users had lower incidence rate for stroke (0.65 vs 1.06) and bleed (1.69 vs 2.20), stroke (0.0006 vs 0.0011, p < 0.001) and bleed-specific hospitalizations (0.002 vs 0.003, p = 0.008), and stroke (0.03 vs 0.04, p < 0.001) and bleed-specific outpatient visits (0.07 vs 0.08, p = 0.018), and significantly lower non-persistence (62.1% vs 66.3%, p < 0.001).
3:::A total of 26 respondents participated in the focus groups ( n = 21) or semi-structured interviews ( n = 5) and 10 caregiver staff completed cognitive interviews. Additional symptoms and problems included agitation, wandering, sleep problems, communication problems and diarrhoea. Refinements or lay terms were required to improve comprehension and consistency of item response for nausea, drowsiness, delusions/hallucinations, agitation, loss of interest, communication problems and interaction. A video presentation was required to support comprehension of instructions and assessment of verbally compromised residents.
3:::Most frequent were patients expressions of treatment preferences (65% of consultations), often the simple wish to have treatment. Expressions of underlying values (48%) and appraisals of treatment aspects (50%) were less common. Most preference-related utterances concerned single statements (59%); in 51% of the consultations, true dialogue was observed. Preference-related utterances were least common in follow-up consultations concerning stable disease or response. Preference-related fragments were patient-initiated (42%), oncologist-facilitated (28%) or oncologist-invited (30%). Oncologist responses likely to trigger more preference-related talk were showing empathy, checking and probe questioning. Likely to reduce space were providing information, personally agreeing and neutral responses.'
3:::Altogether 32 cases were diagnosed, which represents an incidence of 1.44‰ of live newborn infants. 59% were males and 37.5% of them were macrosomic. The most frequent disorder was injury to the plexus at the proximal level (94%). 44% suffered from shoulder dystocia, and 47% still had sequelae at the sixth month. The antecedent of shoulder dystocia was related with a poor prognosis for recovery.
3:::For ESA supplementation, no difference was observed between the groups at the various observed times. Despite similar Hb levels, the patients of group A needed significant lower doses of IV iron (-57.8%) avoiding risks of organ toxicity and obtaining consequent cost saving of nearly 1 €/patient/month.
3:::Eleven participants completed all testing. An orthotic effect on gait was not evident on first use of FES. However, therapeutic effects on gait after 8 weeks use were generally positive, including increases in walking speed due to improved neuromuscular control and power generated at the hip and ankle of the more affected limb. The action of FES alone was not sufficient to overcome all fatigue related deficits in gait but there was evidence 8 weeks use of FES can ameliorate some fatigue effects on lower limb kinetics, including benefits to ankle mechanics involved in generating power around push-off during stance.
3:::Overexpression of HER2/neu protein and a triple-negative immunoprofile and basal-like phenotype of cancer were more frequently seen in the women under 35 years of age. In addition, malignant cells were poorly differentiated and more aggressive, and prognostically favourable types were not often seen, in these women. In terms of the course of disease, the outcome was worse for the younger patients, and complete remission was reached less frequently and more cases of advanced disease and death due to the malignancy were detected.
3:::From a total of 415 residents monitored with the SenseWear(®) activity armbands, 192 met the valid wear-time of 21h or more, and had activity and sleep data recorded. These residents were largely inactive during the daytime (engaged in an average of 1.8h of light physical activity), but achieved recommended amounts of sleep at night (average of 6.8h). There was considerable variation within the sample, and activity and sleep differed by sex (p<0.001), age (p=0.010), mobility (p<0.001), and antipsychotic usage (p=0.030).
3:::Four clusters were identified: Poor Sleepers' (31.2%), 'Moderate Sleepers' (30.7%), 'Mixed Sleepers/Highly Active' (20.5%), and 'Excellent Sleepers/Mixed Activity' (17.6%). The 'Poor Sleepers' cluster had the highest proportion of participants with less-than-recommended sleep duration and poor sleep quality, had the poorest health characteristics and a high proportion of participants with low physical activity.'
3:::Of 2967 women matching the study criteria, 567 were MHT users. The proportion of general rhinitis symptoms was greater among MHT users (24.5%) than among MHT non-users (18.9%, p=0.003). The proportion of cases of rhinorrhea or posterior nasal drip was also greater among MHT users (6.3% vs. 4.3%, p=0.042), while there were no differences between the two groups in the proportion of cases of nasal obstruction. There were no differences in total IgE and specific IgE levels between the two groups. MHT was used by 23.4% of women with chronic rhinitis and 18.0% of women without chronic rhinitis. Age, waist circumference, and body mass index were also greater among women without chronic rhinitis than among those with chronic rhinitis.
3:::Experiencing IPV and being a caregiver was associated with poor health outcomes on three of the four outcomes (depressive symptoms, OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.58, 2.75; stress, OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.55, 2.87; physical HRQOL β -2.39, 95% CI -3.34, -1.44; all p≤0.001, fully adjusted) compared with not experiencing IPV or caregiving. On these outcomes, IPV and caregiving combined had a stronger association than IPV or caregiving separately. For mental HRQOL, a weaker association was found (OR 1.41 95% CI 1.02, 1.95, fully adjusted, p=0.04).
3:::Patients with rCCA-occlusion showed intra-individual side differences between hemispheres, with significantly lower subcortical perfusion of the right hemisphere and reduced cortical perfusion. In one-third of patients with rCCA-occlusion, rCBF of the right-hemisphere was reduced by more than 20% when compared to the left hemisphere. Despite intra-individual side differences, mean rCBF in patients with rCCA occlusion was not reduced compared to controls.
3:::The mean age of the women at the time of AMH, FSH, and AFC assessment was 43 years. The cumulative incidence of menopause at 25 years (or follow-up) was 27% (n=426), and the incidence within 5 years was 13% (n=55). Among women aged 45-49 years, undetectable AMH concentrations were associated with a greater than 60% probability of menopause within 5 years, whereas approximately 1/3 of women with no or just one antral follicle experienced menopause within 5 years. Both low and high concentrations of FSH were associated with greater odds of menopause than intermediate concentrations. Models with multiple markers did not improve the prediction of menopause over that afforded by models with single markers.
3:::Although the 10-day administration of antibiotics reduced the stool weight per hour to half, the dewaxed brown rice and LPS groups showed a trend towards improvement at a level comparable to the group receiving no antibiotics. The body weight significantly decreased after the 27-day administration of antibiotics but was improved in the 50% dewaxed brown rice group at a level comparable to the group receiving no antibiotics. Though the defecation frequency and wet and dry stool weights per hour were reduced by as much as 50% in the group receiving antibiotics, a significant improvement in constipation was observed in the 50% dewaxed brown rice group.
3:::A total of 263 patients (mean age, 64.1 years) with 374 D-dimer measurements (median, 0.44 mcg/mL) were included. The risk of developing AE was significantly higher in patients with elevated serum D-dimer level (adjusted odds ratio: 10.46; 95% CI: 1.24-88.11; p = 0.03). Patients with elevated serum D-dimer level had increased risk for respiratory-related hospitalization, all-cause hospitalization, VTE, and all-cause mortality. The other factors predictive for AE were home oxygen therapy, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase, decreased FVC, and decreased FEV1.0.
3:::The distributions of MMP-8 C-799T, Val436Ala and Lys460Thr genotypes were not different between the oral cancer and non-cancer control groups. We also analyzed the allelic frequency distributions and no significant difference was found. As for gene-environment interaction analysis, there was an increased risk for smokers, alcohol drinkers or betel quid chewers with variant MMP-8 C-799T or Val436Ala genotypes.
3:::Patients showed significant impairment in respiratory functioning and psychological distress. Relative to the control, the COPD group exhibited greater depression, anxiety, physical symptom concerns and avoidance (alone and accompanied), irrespective of whether they were panickers or not. Patients with high avoidance showed more intense physical concerns when compared to those with low avoidance. Importantly, the level of avoidance predicted emotional distress and increased physical concerns in COPD.
3:::RNA-seq revealed that there were 1,736 (FDR<0.001) differentially expressed genes in the VC(-) and VC(+) groups. From the functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes in the VC(-) and VC(+) groups, predicted functionalities including cell death and cytotoxicity increased in the VC(+) group. Furthermore, it was predicted that the difference in hair growth between the VC(-) and VC(+) groups was caused by the expression of genes including keratin-related genes and the Sonic hedgehog gene. It was confirmed that hair growth was significantly promoted; hair growth from hair papilla cells was also confirmed by HE staining of the shaved backs of SMP-30/GNL-KO mice in the VC(+) group.
3:::EGFR expression at any level was detected in 40/50 (80%) cores. Over-expression was observed in 23/40 (57.5%) cases. Gene amplification was identified in 11/50 (22%) cases whereas chromosome 7 polysomy in 8/50 (16%) cases. Pure chromosome 7 multiplication alone led to low or moderate levels of expression. Overall EGFR expression was correlated with gene (p=0.001) and interestingly with chromosome 7 centromere numerical imbalances (p=0.004).
3:::Final clinical diagnoses included 453 children with pneumonia, 133 with asthma, 103 with bronchiolitis, and 143 with upper respiratory infections. In total, CXR confirmed the diagnosis in 191 (42%) of 453 children with clinical pneumonia. A consolidation on lung ultrasound, which is our primary endpoint for pneumonia, had a sensitivity of 88.5%, specificity of 100%, and an area under-the-curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.97) when compared to radiographically-confirmed clinical pneumonia. When any abnormality on lung ultrasound was compared to radiographically-confirmed clinical pneumonia the sensitivity increased to 92.2% and the specificity decreased to 95.2%, with an area under-the-curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91-0.96).
3:::Patients with DM showed significantly elevated muscle tissue IL-4 and IFN-γ levels, whereas IL-17 levels were comparable between patients with DM and controls. Immunoblotting studies confirmed ELISA results. In DM muscle specimens, IL-4 and IFN-γ levels were positively correlated, while no correlation was observed between IL-17 and the other two cytokines. Moreover, IL-4 and IFN-γ levels were significantly negative correlated with muscle strength grades for the deltoid muscle.
3:::The review of 49 sections (mean=16.3, range=14-20) in the three colectomies revealed 60 ulcers (mean=20, range=13-27). The following CCC phenotypes were found bordering mucosal ulcers: with asymmetric lateral fission (n=11), with dual or three-foiled corrupted fission (n=19), with cystic dilatations (n=3), L-shaped crypts (n=7), T-inverted crypts (n=6), shoe-shaped crypts (n=3), horizontal crypts (n=14), multi-lobate crypts (n=2), and/or inter-connecting crypts (n=5).
3:::Patients cared for, had moderate to very severe COPD and the sample of caregivers ranged from 24 to 406. Thirty-five instruments were used in fifty studies to assess caregivers psychological status and mood (9 instruments), burden/distress (12 instruments), quality of life (5 instruments) or other (9 instruments). Eighteen studies assessed the measurement properties of 21 instruments, most commonly hypothesis testing (known validity) and internal consistency. Study quality varied from 'poor' to 'fair' and with many properties rated as 'indeterminate'.'
3:::Forty-five patients received a total of 45 implant-based reconstructions using SurgiMend® (18 cases; 40%) or Tutomesh® (27 cases; 60%). Gross complication rates were 27.8% for SurgiMend® and 37.0% for Tutomesh® including hematoma, postoperative skin irritation, infection, red breast syndrome and revision surgery. The most common complication was postoperative red breast syndrome. Severe complications requiring revision surgery did not differ significantly in patients treated with SurgiMend® (0 cases, 0%) compared to Tutomesh® (1 case, 3.7%).
3:::Topical administration of medium- and high-dose CSF significantly enhanced perianal ulcer healing as compared to the untreated control (p<0.05). The macroscopic ulceration score was significantly reduced only in the high-dose CSF-treated group as compared to the control (p<0.01). All doses of CSF and PP ameliorated histological damages in the rats with induced perianal ulceration. High-dose CSF or PP significantly reduced the expression of PGE2 and IL-8 as compared to the control (p<0.01). No treatment-related toxicity was found in either the CSF- or the PP-treated mice.
3:::A total of 206,179 procedures were analyzed. Compared with low-volume centers, high-volume centers had significantly lower observed-to-expected rates of 1-month graft loss (0.93 vs 1.18, P<0.001), 1-year graft loss (0.97 vs 1.12, P<0.001), 1-month patient death (0.90 vs 1.29, P=0.005), and 1-year patient death (0.95 vs 1.15, P=0.001). Low-volume centers were frequently in close proximity to higher volume centers, with a median distance of 7 miles (interquartile range: 2 to 75).
3:::The reliability between the 2 assessments by the same evaluator on the Dolphin automatic segmentation function for volume (ICC, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95, 0.98) and minimal cross-sectional airway (ICC, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.69, 0.91) was excellent. The interoperator reliability for volume was also excellent (ICC, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95, 0.98), but only good (ICC, 0.701; 95% CI, 0.44, 0.85) for minimal cross-sectional airway. In contrast, the Spearman rank correlation test demonstrated weak associations between the values of the automatic measurements for both volume (4.9%; ρ = -0.22) and minimal cross-sectional airway (3.7%; ρ = 0.19). Assessments of accuracy via Receiver Operating characteristic analysis, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive values, positive predictive values, and likelihood ratios demonstrated the poor clinical applicability of volume and minimal cross-sectional airway numbers provided by Dolphin Imaging.
3:::The region corresponding to the maxillary canines appeared to be thinner, and the palatal area of the maxillary central incisors and the distobuccal region of the mandibular second molars appeared to be thicker. Greater tooth inclinations were observed in the maxillary incisors and mandibular canines, and smaller tooth inclinations were observed on the buccal roots of the mandibular second molars.
3:::Adults with IDD and HIV were more likely than those without HIV to have three types of mental health disorders: non-psychotic disorders [aRR: adjusted rate ratio (aRR): 1.22 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.47)], psychotic disorders [aRR: 1.57 (1.09, 2.28)] and substance use disorders [aRR: 3.52 (2.53, 4.91)]. Adults with IDD and HIV were also more likely to have emergency department visits [aRR: 1.68 (1.42, 1.98)] and hospital admissions [aRR: 2.55 (1.74, 3.73)] for any reason, and to have mental health emergency department visits and/or admissions [aRR: 2.82 (1.90, 4.18)].
3:::There were 720 (20.6%) patients in the statin treatment group. Dementia or cognitive impairment was an associated comorbid condition in 7.9% patients in the statin treatment group compared to 3.1% patients in the non-statin group (P < 0.001). Analysis of all of the patients with cognitive impairment or dementia showed that among the age ranges of 51 years through 100 years, the patients in the statin treatment group had a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment or dementia compared to the non-statin group. In the statin treatment group, we found significantly higher prevalence of hyperlipidemia (86.3%), hypertension (69.6%), diabetes mellitus (36.0%), osteoarthritis (31.5%), coronary artery disease (26.1%), hypothyroidism (21.5%) and depression (19.3%) compared to the non-statin group (P < 0.001). About 39.9% of the patients with dementia or cognitive impairment were on statin therapy compared to 18.9% patients who had no dementia or cognitive impairment and were on statin therapy (P < 0.001). Among the patients with cognitive deficit or dementia in the statin treatment group, the majority of the patients were either on atorvastatin (43.9%) or simvastatin (35.1%), followed by rosuvastatin (12.2%) and pravastatin (8.8%). We found greater odds of dementia or cognitive impairment with each year increase in age (1.3 times), in women (2.2 times), African American race (2.7 times), non-consumption of moderate amount of alcohol (two times), diabetes mellitus (1.6 times), hypothyroidism (1.7 times), cerebrovascular accident (3.2 times), and other rheumatological diseases (1.8 times).
3:::Anti-E. histolytica IgG antibodies were found in five (2.7%) of 187 female sex workers and in 16 (4.3%) of 374 controls (odds ratios (OR) = 0.61; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.22 - 1.70; P = 0.34). Mean optical density of the immunoassay in seropositive cases and controls was 1.35 ± 0.93 and 0.73 ± 0.45, respectively (P = 0.05). Seroprevalence of E. histolytica infection did not vary significantly with age, education, socioeconomic level, or health status of sex workers. Seropositivity to E. histolytica did not correlate with work characteristics such as duration in the occupation, condom use, type of sex, or a history of sexually transmitted diseases, or with behavioral variables such as washing hands before eating, or consumption of untreated water.
3:::Liver function parameters were increased in ulcerative colitis patients, and total antioxidant status, as well. Reducing power significantly decreased, but there was no significant difference compared to the control group of glutathione peroxidase and H-donor activity, we observed only tendentious decrease. The antioxidant protection of more than 54% of patients had a significantly lower rate, according to all the parameters. With chemiluminescence measurement we measured better free radical scavenging capacity, both in plasma and in erythrocytes as a result of the therapy, however, it showed an increase of superoxide dismutase activity, which warns of inflammatory processes. The cause of the decrease in bile acid levels found in the group of ulcerative colitis patients, can be the accelerated peristaltic.
3:::There was no difference between the two groups regarding preoperative diagnosis, intraoperative surgical procedure performed, and length of hospital stay. The groups were compared in terms of postoperative pathological diagnosis using the Chi-square test, and there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Comparing the operation time and hematocrit change, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups. Both patient and observer PSOAS scar scores were better in MLS group (P < 0.05).
3:::Mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not statistically different between the two groups, with P = 0.471, 0.429, and 0.847 at baseline, 3 and 6 months, respectively. The incidence of AKI, RRT, and BTT was not statistically different. Mortality was less in the inotrope group (P < 0.001).
3:::Ninety-nine children comprised the ASD group, and 101 children were in the control group. Our results demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of malocclusion in children with ASD compared with the control group (P <0.001). Patients with ASD were significantly more likely to have posterior crossbite (P = 0.03), increased overjet (P <0.0001), and severe maxillary crowding (P <0.01). Furthermore, children with ASD were more likely to have malocclusion than non-ASD children, independently of their demographic characteristics (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.46, -4.65).
3:::Vildagliptin did not significantly alter the mean plasma glucose level (175.5 ± 54.4 mg/dL vs. 179.1 ± 73.4 mg/dL) or HbA1c (8.01% vs. 8.02%) after 12 weeks. With alogliptin, mean plasma glucose increased from 175.4 ± 50.9 mg/dL to 195.3 ± 55.0 mg/dL after 12 weeks and HbA1c increased significantly from 8.0% to 8.3% (P < 0.05). At 12 weeks after switching from vildagliptin to high-dose sitagliptin (100 mg daily), HbA1c was increased to 8.3%, but it was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced to the baseline level of 8.0% after switching from alogliptin. The reduction of HbA1c was significantly greater in the vildagliptin group than the alogliptin group (P = 0.008), but the response rate (achieving the target HbA1c < 7.0%) did not differ significantly between the two groups.
3:::Data from the amino-acid blood analysis demonstrated that the levels of L-citrulline and L-arginine decreased on postoperative days 1, coinciding with an increase of ADMA levels. The overall result of these changes was a decrease in the arginine to ADMA ratio by 21% from the preoperative period to postoperative day 2 (P = 0.02).
3:::African Americans and non-African Americans did not differ in prevalence of lifetime and current psychiatric disorders and risky behaviors, and HCV knowledge. HCV clinical characteristics were similar between both groups in terms of HCV exposure history, number of months aware of HCV diagnosis, stage of fibrosis, and HCV virologic levels. African Americans did have higher proportions of diabetes, renal disease, and bleeding ulcer.
3:::Experimental tooth movements measured intraorally between cusp tips were significantly greater (25.3%) than control tooth movements. The approximate center of resistance measured radiographically also moved significantly more (about 31%) on the experimental than on the control side. The experimental premolar tipped more than the control premolar (10.5° vs 8.7°), but the difference was not statistically significant. The medullary bone volume fraction mesial to the third premolar was significantly less (9.1%) and the bone was significantly less dense (9%) on the experimental side than on the control side. Histology showed no apparent side differences in the numbers of osteoclasts and osteoblasts evident in the medullary bone.
3:::In 58 children with CHC (55.2%) significant liver fibrosis was observed ( ≥F2). Higher proportion of cells expressing CD158e inhibitory receptors was observed in the group of children with ALT > 2UNL (21.11 ± 14.60 vs. 12.22 ± 8.99%; p = 0.037). While higher proportion of cells expressing inhibitory CD158b receptor was observed in children with significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2) compared to minimal fibrosis (F < 2) - (34.14 ± 12.44 vs. 27.48 ± 8.71%; p = 0.049). Children with advanced fibrosis (F ≥ 3) had higher MFI of NK cell CD 158b receptor than children with fibrosis scored F < 3 - (5344.20 ± 3407.49 vs. 2979.67 ± 1190.64; p = 0.049). Proportion of NK cells expressing CD158b was found a predictor of significant fibrosis in univariate analysis - [OR 1.065; 95%CI (1.07-1.15); p = 0.046].
3:::Serum HCV RNA was positive in 2 (1%) patients whom considered as MHCI, and 6 (3.03%) patients had positive PBMC HCV RNA.
3:::The series was composed of 37 patients with a mean age of 53.2 ± 47.4 years (51.4% female). Mean cyst diameter was 19.4 ± 15.5 cm, and 75.7% of the lesions were located in the right hepatic lobe. The most frequent surgical technique used for the cyst was subtotal pericystectomy (56.8%); the residual cavity was treated by capitonnage (27.0%) or omentoplasty (21.6%), and a phrenoplasty with or without prosthetic material was performed for the TIHE. Mean hospital stay was 6.0 ± 5.7 days and follow-up was 61.4 ± 79.9 months; a mortality rate of 2.7% (one patient) and a POM of 24.3% (9 patients) were verified.
3:::Compared with cirrhotic patients without PVT, cirrhotic patients with PVT had comparable plasma values of FVIIa, AT, and the FVIIa-AT complex. However, they had significantly lower values compared to non-cirrhotic patients with PVT and healthy controls. Cirrhotic patients with PVT had increased monocytic TF expression (MIF CD142) compared to non-PVT cirrhotic patients and healthy controls [86.5 (93.5) vs. 18 (32.0) and 11.0 (6.0), respectively; p < 0.001 for each]. However, cirrhosis PVT could not be distinguished from non-cirrhosis PVT. The area under the ROC curve of MIF CD142 was 0.759 (0.641- 0.876; p = 0.000) at an optimal cut-off value of 45, which yielded a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 77.1%, as well as a PPV and NPV of 69.2% for each.
3:::We reviewed 233 cases of hepatic cancer. Amongst these, hepatocellular carcinomas represented 19.3% (n = 45), followed by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, which accounted for 7.7% (n = 18). The median age of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was 63 years, and most of them presented with cholestasis and intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. Unfortunately, 89% (n = 16) of them were in an advanced stage and 80% had multicentric tumors. Median survival was 286 days among patients with advanced stage tumors (25th-75th interquartile range, 174-645 days). No correlation was found between the presence of comorbidities defined by the Charlson index, and survival. We evaluated the presence of definite and probable risk factors for the development of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, that is, smoking, alcohol consumption, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.
3:::A total of 104 patients with negative contrast-enhanced echocardiogram (CE) were compared to 63 patients with IPVD and 63 patients with HPS. Only four patients were categorized as ‘severe’ HPS based on degree of hipoxemia (defined as PaO2 < 60 mmHg). Twenty IPVD patients were followed with ABG over a mean duration of 21 months (range 9-43), of whom 7 (35%) subsequently met HPS criteria. Overall unadjusted survival from the time of LT evaluation using multi-state survival models that accounted for pre- and post-LT time was not statistically different among the three groups (negative CE, IPVD, and HPS; p > 0.5).
3:::Although UB-SDM graduates generally assessed BP (77%) and CBS (23%), most did not follow the schools strict educational policies when providing these services. Dental practice policies mandating BP and CBS assessments were positively correlated with UB-SDM graduates' actually providing these services. Lack of time and poor practice support were cited as negative factors toward BP and CBS assessments.'
3:::Each patient had temporal optic disc pallor and significant thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer in both eyes, although there was phenotypic variability among the patients that ranged from asymptomatic to moderately decreased visual acuity. For the affected brother and mother, the mean deviation values from SAP were within the normal range, whereas those from SWAP were significantly below the normal range (P < .05). The genetic analysis identified a newly discovered heterozygous deletion that encompasses exons 9-14 and revealed a breakpoint junction that directly connects intron 8 to intron 14.
3:::The expression of TSP1 was high in the mucosal-atrophy group and tended to be high in the Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) (+) and multiple cancer groups. The levels of CD36, STAT3 and TGFβR2 mRNA were significantly higher in the TSP1-high group. TSP1 signaling pathway was induced in multiple cancer or atrophy (+) or H. pylori (+) compared to cases with single cancer, atrophy (-) and H. pylori (-). Expression of proteins involved in the TSP1 signaling pathway in non-cancer tissues with multiple gastric cancers were higher than that with single gastric cancer.
3:::Six patients presented with progressive sensorimotor deficits predominantly or exclusively in the lower extremities and were diagnosed with POEMS syndrome. In 4 patients, a diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy (CIDP) was mistakenly made. Low concentration of serum paraprotein and elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were detected in all 6 patients. Initial serum immunofixation and skeletal survey were normal in 2 patients each. On nerve conduction studies, motor and sensory responses were absent in the lower extremity in all 6 patients. Conduction velocity slowing and F-wave latency prolongation appear slightly more pronounced than distal motor latency prolongation in the upper extremity. Spinal MRI showed diffuse lumbosacral nerve root enhancement in all. In 3 patients, targeted bone marrow biopsy was needed for confirming the POEMS diagnosis. Treatment with corticosteroids, chemotherapy agent, focal radiation and/or autologous stem cell transplantation led to significant improvement in 5 of 6 patients.
3:::Panelists identified a total of 12 PPs. The PPs identified by the highest number of panelists were (1) before surgical incision, (2) before aortic cannulation, (3) before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) initiation, (4) before CPB separation, and (5) at time of transfer of care from operating room (OR) to intensive care unit (ICU) staff. There was low variability among panelists ratings of the PP ""before surgical incision,"" moderate response variability for the PPs ""before separation from CPB,"" ""before transfer from OR table to bed,"" and ""at time of transfer of care from OR to ICU staff,"" and high response variability for the remaining 8 PPs. In addition, the perceived importance of each of these PPs varies between disciplines and between institutions.'
3:::A total of 8,275 patients met inclusion criteria; 65.4% were male and the median age was 47. The mean ISS was 11 ± 8.9. Nine hundred seventeen patients (11.1%) died after discharge; 4.8% of patients had hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and 4.2% had a urinary tract infection (UTI). The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of mortality after discharge in patients who had pneumonia and UTI were 1.77 (1.35, 2.31, p < 0.001) and 2.44 (1.87, 3.17, p < 0.001), respectively. After adjusting for patient age, gender, ISS, ventilator use, and history of COPD (pneumonia patients only), the odds for mortality after discharge remained significant for pneumonia (OR = 1.57 (1.09, 2.23), p = 0.013) but not for UTI (OR = 1.25 (0.93, 1.68), p = 0.147). The top causes of death after discharge in patients with HAP were COPD (11.4%) and falls (7.1%).
3:::Sixty-three lesions were analysed from 22 patients. Poor agreement was seen between predicted and measured dose values. TLG was a superior measure of response, and all dose metrics were significant prognostic factors, with a D avg of ~50 Gy derived as the critical threshold for a significant response (>50% reduction in TLG). No significant correlation was found between baseline TLG or RAS mutation status and response. Measured dose heterogeneity was a significant prognostic factor and when combined with D avg had a positive predictive value for response >80%. In the exploratory analysis for prognostic factors of survival, low hepatic tumour burden and mean reduction in TLG >65% were independently associated with improved overall survival.
3:::Thirty-four patients were included, and 14 responded to volume expansion. In the responders, the mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, cardiac output, stroke volume and PtcO2 increased significantly, while the heart rate decreased significantly by both PLR and volume expansion. Changes in the stroke volume induced either by PLR or volume expansion were significantly greater in responders than in non-responders. The correlation between the changes in PtcO2 and stroke volume induced by volume expansion was significant. Volume expansion induced an increase in the PtcO2 of 14% and PLR induced an increase in PtcO2 of 13% predicted fluid responsiveness.
3:::During 2-year follow-up, the rates of all-cause death, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and stent thrombosis were not significantly different between two groups. However, the rate of revascularization was significantly higher in domestic DES group, shown as higher rates of overall revascularization, target vessel revascularization (TVR), and target lesion revascularization (TLR) (9.7% vs 6.4%, P < 0.001; 5.6% vs 3.2%, P < 0.001; 4.5% vs 2.2%, P < 0.001, respectively). Accordingly, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) rate was significantly higher in domestic DES group (12.1% vs 8.5%, P < 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated that domestic DES was an independent risk factor of MACE (HR [95%CI]: 1.22 [1.05-1.41]), overall revascularization (HR [95%CI]: 1.29 [1.09-1.53]), TVR (HR [95%CI]: 1.54 [1.22-1.94]), and TLR (HR [95%CI]: 1.85 [1.41-2.42]). After propensity score matching, the rates of overall revascularization, TVR, and TLR were still significantly higher in domestic DES group, and domestic DES was still predictive of overall revascularization, TVR, and TLR in multivariate Cox regression analysis.
3:::There was a significant difference between CPI obtained from all patients with elevated right atrial pressure compared to those with normal right atrial pressure (P < .0001). This finding was consistent in sensitivity analysis that compared right and left hemispheric CPI from patients with both elevated and normal right atrial pressure.
3:::The highest AL rate was found in the Glubran 2 group (7/11), followed by the 4-sutures group without TA (5/11), and the Omnex group (5/11). Histoacryl Flexible showed the lowest AL rate (2/11). In the control group, only one rat showed signs of AL. Histologically, the highest influx of inflammatory cells was found in the 4-suture group without TA and for Omnex and Glubran 2. Histoacryl Flexible caused more mature collagen deposition when compared to the other TA groups.
3:::Five hundred surveys were mailed, with 169 (33.8%) being returned. The median age of the respondents was 57 years (range: 18-92 years); 53% were female. The majority (89.3%) of participants recalled receiving information about pain self-management. Analgesic use was reported by 95.4% of participants in the week following discharge. Moderate-severe pain was reported by 80 participants (47.3%); 63.7% and 11.3% of patients reported underuse and overuse of analgesics compared to what was recommended, respectively.
3:::The intraocular pressure rose significantly (p < 0.001) for the follow-up period of 3 weeks after which animals were sacrificed. Eyes exposed to an elevated intraocular pressure showed an initial decrease of retinal ganglion cells, retinal nerve fiber layer (p < 0.05) and an impairment of the optic nerve (p < 0.01). Mass spectrometry led to the identification and quantification of 931 retinal proteins, whereas 32 were considerably altered. Bioinformatics-assisted clustering revealed that a majority of these proteins are functionally associated with cell differentiation, apoptosis and stress response. The creation of an interactive protein network showed that numerous altered proteins are connected regarding their cellular function. Protein kinase b, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 and the NF-κB complex seem to be essential molecules in this context.
3:::From March 2012 to February 2015, 14 patients from seven different institutions were enrolled in the study, and 13 cases were evaluable for assessment. Eleven cases (84.6%) had distant metastases, and 8 cases (61.5%) had obstructive jaundice. There was no CR, 1 PR (7.7%), 11 SD (84.6%), and 1 progressive disease (PD) (7.7%). The RR was 7.7%, whereas the DCR was 92.3%. The median PFS was 3.1 months, the median OS was 6.2 months, and the one-year survival rate was 0%. Grade 3 hematologic toxicity was observed in three cases (23%), but all of them recovered upon drug withdrawal, and there was no treatment-related death.
3:::The Cox regression model best predicts average incidence of the outcome over time, whereas CTA survival models best predict either relatively high, or low, incidence of the outcome over time.
3:::Forty-one subjects were included. Pre-ECMO ventilator settings were: mean VT, 6.1 ± 0.9 mL/kg; breathing frequency, 32 ± 4 breaths/min; PEEP, 11 ± 4 cm H2O; peak inspiratory pressure, 48 ± 9 cm H2O; plateau pressure, 30.4 ± 4.4 cm H2O. At ECMO initiation, blood gas results were: pH 7.22 ± 0.17, PaO2 /FIO2 = 63 ± 22 mm Hg; PaCO2 = 56 ± 18 mm Hg; FIO2 = 99 ± 2%. Pre-ECMO data were available in 35 and 27 subjects for calculation of the PRESERVE score and RESP score, respectively. Pre-ECMO scoring system results were: median PRESERVE score, 4 (interquartile range 2-5), and median RESP score, 0 (interquartile range -2 to 2). Twenty-three subjects (56%) died, including 19 receiving ECMO. In univariate analysis, plateau pressure (P = .031), driving pressure (P = <.001), and compliance (P = .02) recorded at the time of ECMO initiation as well as the PRESERVE score (P = .032) were significantly associated with mortality. With a c-index of 0.69 (95% CI 0.53-0.87), the PRESERVE score had better discrimination than the RESP score (c-index of 0.60 [95% CI 0.41-0.78]) for predicting mortality.
3:::Chronic ketamine prevented the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by BDNF, without affecting locomotion and food and water consumption. After pump depletion, a late hyperalgesic response to paw pressure stimulation emerged, which can be lastingly antagonized by cyclotraxine-B. Chronic propentofylline treatment irreversibly suppressed BDNF-induced hyperalgesia.
3:::A total of 18 073 individuals were included. DVA prevalence in the neonate/infant age group was 1.5% (5/335) compared with 7.1% (51/714) in the toddler/preschool age group. In both the grade-school age group and adult age group, DVA prevalence was 9.6% (150/1557 and 1483/15 467, respectively). Neonates/infants were significantly less likely to have DVAs than other age groups (P<0.001).
3:::Median (range) age was 57 (44-60) years, median follow-up 8.9 (1.5-17.2) years and median PSA follow-up 5.9 (0.8-15) years. Low, intermediate and high-risk disease represented 53%, 37% and 10% of cases. Ten years post-implant overall and prostate cancer-specific survival were 98% and 99% for low-risk, 99% and 100% for intermediate and 93% and 95% for high-risk disease respectively. Ten years post-implant relapse free survival using the nadir plus 2 definition was 95%, 90% and 87% for low, intermediate and high-risk disease respectively. Urinary stricture was the most common genitourinary event observed in 19 (3.2%) patients. Preserved erectile function five years post-implant was observed in 75% of patients who were potent prior to treatment.
3:::The calf had a dull kinky coat with mild hypotrichosis, and teeth with brown staining and enamel defects. Histological examination of skin biopsies was compatible with a follicular dysplasia. Radiography and computed tomography revealed thickening of the skull bones and large pulp cavities with a marked thinning of enamel affecting all teeth. A de novo germline mutation affecting the distal-less homeobox gene (DLX3) was identified. The 10 bp frameshift mutation in exon 3 of the bovine DLX3 gene is predicted to replace the second C-terminal transactivation domain of the wild-type protein by a recoded peptide of 99 amino acids without any sequence similarity.
3:::There have been positive developments in most areas of anesthetic practice, with the most striking being implementation of a postgraduate training program for physician anesthesiologists. This has increased physician anesthesia staff in Zambia 6-fold within 4 years, and created an active research stream as part of the program. Standards of monitoring and availability of drugs have improved, and anesthetic activity has expanded out of operating theaters into the rest of the hospital. A considerable increase in the number of cesarean deliveries performed under spinal anesthetic may be a marker for safer anesthetic practice. Anesthesiologists have yet to take responsibility for the management of pain.
3:::Fifteen participants were recruited. The mean gray scale US echo intensity distribution obtained was 41.9. A paired t test of the global mean echo intensity value obtained for each image from the US operators did not show any significant difference (P = .77). A t test was performed, comparing the echo intensity of the group of patients with neck pain and healthy control participants, and the difference was found to be significant (P = .052). The median blob area was 2.71. The quartile range for the blob area was 1.72 for the 25th percentile to 4.90 for the 75th percentile.
3:::For all 3 conditions, we found that patients treated by physician owners were much more likely to be referred for a course of physical therapy when compared with patients seen by physician nonowners. A consistent pattern emerged among patients who had at least 1 physical therapy visit; non-self-referred episodes included more physical therapy visits, and more physical therapy services per episode in comparison with episodes classified as self-referral. Most self-referred episodes were short and the initial visit did not include an evaluation.
3:::Among 2746 women with BC (72.6% were admitted to specialized hospitals), the overall average expenditure was US $8450 (medical expenditure: $7527; non-medical expenditure: $922). Significant differences were found among the overall expenditure in the four clinical stages (P < 0.0001); the expenditure was higher in stages III and IV than that in stages I and II, whereas the stage IV was the highest (P < 0.0001). Moreover, a higher self-reported predicted reimbursement ratio was associated with a less economic impact on the patients family, and the average time lost was estimated as $1529.'
3:::Pneumonectomy was often performed for lung cancer invading the aorta, superior vena cava, and left atrium. Complete resection (R0), no mediastinal lymph node metastasis and without using cardiopulmonary bypass led to a good prognosis. Induction therapy was often performed for complete resection. Regarding mediastinal tumors, thymic epithelial tumors or germ cell tumors occasionally invaded the great vessels or heart structures. For these malignancies, multimodality therapy was often performed, and complete resection could be one of the prognostic factors. The resection of primary pulmonary artery sarcoma (PPAS) is also a combined thoracic and cardiovascular surgery. The primary treatment for PPAS is surgical resection; specifically, pulmonary endarterectomy and pneumonectomy, because PPAS has substantial resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The prognosis of PPAS is poor, but surgical resection has potential for long-term survival.
3:::The α-angle and HNOR after collapse (58.3° ± 10.0° and 0.138 ± 0.033, respectively) indicated significantly decreased anterior femoral head-neck offset compared with those before collapse (46.2° ± 5.7° and 0.178 ± 0.018, respectively; p < 0.0001). These parameters had a positive association with the depth of femoral head collapse (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.01, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in either the α-angle or HNOR between hips with ONFH before collapse and hips without ONFH.
3:::Fifty-five patients were identified, including 40 with tubal HP, 9 interstitial HP and 6 cornual HP. The most frequent manifestations before diagnosis was abdominal pain (29.1%), while 19 patients (34.5%) had no symptoms before diagnosis. The sensitivity of symptoms for HP was 65.5%. Gestational age at symptom onset of these patients with symptoms (n = 36) was 5.8 weeks (range 4.7-8.1). Forty-seven patients (85.5%) were suspected of HP when they received first transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS). The mean gestational age at diagnosis was 6.3 weeks (range 4.7-8.3, 16-41 days after ET). First TVS suggesting HP (P = 0.000) and first TVS performed before day 27 (P = 0.000) were two independent predictors for gestational age at diagnosis. Gestational age at surgery day was 6.7 weeks (range 5.3-10.7). Fifty-one patients (92.7%) resulted in a live birth. Gestational age at surgery day was the only independent risk factor for miscarriage in patients with HP treated by laparotomy (OR 0.003, 95% CI 0.001-0.604).
3:::Of patients who underwent only exploration and neurolysis, 35.3% showed a good quality of recovery. Patients who underwent nerve reconstruction using nerve grafting showed a better rate of good quality recovery (56.7%), and the results following nerve transfer depended on the type of transfer used. After surgery, 82.6% of patients showed significant improvement, 82.6% were satisfied, and 81.2% responded positively when asked if they would undergo surgery again if they knew the current result beforehand. Overall, 69.6% patients continued working after surgery. The mean DASH disability score was high (58.7) in the study group. Patients who had early surgery showed a consistently higher DASH score. About 76% of patients reported having pain regularly, and 18.8% reported depression or anxiety.
3:::We analyzed clinical factors in 40 patients and molecular pathological factors in 27 patients for MPA efficacy. The overall response rate was 35% in all 40 patients and there were 10 patients (25%) with continued complete or partial response for over 5 years. However, higher Allred score for PgR (p = 0.050) tended to be and lower Ki67 labeling index (p = 0.001) were significantly predictive factors for long-term complete or partial response over 5 years. Median progression-free survival was 6.4 (2-217) months and the 5-year progression-free survival rate was 32%. Multivariate analysis showed that Allred score ≥3 for PgR (p = 0.039) was the only significant predictive marker for long-term disease control. There were no severe adverse events that resulted in discontinuation of MPA.
3:::All comparative data are expressed as (V. Eld. vs Eld.) unless otherwise specified. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in the V. Eld. group (11.9% vs 6.1%), although this did not translate into a significant difference in cardiac mortality (6.3% vs 3.7%) or major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (16.2% vs 12.5%). The composite incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, definite/probable stent thrombosis, and TIMI major bleed was 4.7%, 1.4% 1.9%, and 6.4%, respectively with no significant difference between both cohorts.
3:::A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of transfer patients between January 2013 and October 2016 with large vessel occlusions identified 108 ED-IV patients and 261 patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy (DAN=111 patients and ED-IA=150 patients). There were no differences in baseline characteristics among the 3 groups. The median computed tomography ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) was lower in the ED-IV group versus the ED-IA and DAN groups (8 versus 9; P=0.001). In the DAN versus ED-IA cohort, there were comparable rates of TICI2b/3 recanalization and access to recanalization time. There was significantly faster hospital arrival to groin access time in the DAN cohort (81 minutes versus 22 minutes; P=0.001). Functional independence at 90 days was comparable in the DAN versus ED-IA cohorts but worse in the ED-IV group (43% versus 44% versus 22%; P=0.001).
3:::The highest EFTh values (3.3±0.96 mm vs. 4.51±0.66 mm, P<.001) were observed in the abnormal aortic IMT group. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that aortic IMT was independently correlate with EFTh (β=0.423, P<.001). Moreover, EFTh was found to be associated with history of transient ischemic attack (r=.403, P<.001) and abnormal IMT (r=.643, P<.001) in bivariate analysis.
3:::After adjusting for clinical variables, the biomarkers associated with worse overall survival were NLR >5 (HR=1.66 95%CI 1.08-2.55; p=0.021) and PLR >300 (HR=1.82 95%CI 1.10-2.99; p=0.019). When stratified by molecular subtype, the independent markers related to death were PLR >300 for triple negative (HR 3.27 95%CI 1.38-7.76; p=0.007); NLR >5 (HR 2.47 95%CI 1.16-5.28; p=0.019), ANC >7500 (HR 1.84 95%CI 1.17-2.90; p=0.008) and dNLR >3 (HR 2.45 95%CI 1.29-4.66; p=0.006) for luminal.
3:::137 women responded to the open questions in the survey. An inductive thematic analysis was conducted and three overarching themes emerged. Theme 1 related to employer/manager awareness, specifically to knowledge about the menopause and awareness of how the physical work environment might impact on menopausal women. Theme 2 related to employer/manager communication skills and behaviors, specifically those considered helpful and desired and those considered unhelpful and undesired. Theme 3 described employer actions, involving staff training and raising awareness, and supportive policies such as those relating to sickness absence and flexible working hours.
3:::All 34 autoimmune pancreatitis patients showed reduced pancreatic swelling. The main pancreatic duct dilation ( > 3 mm), the diameter of the main pancreatic duct, the capsule-like rim sign, and serum CA19-9 levels were significantly different between the autoimmune pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer patients (2.9% versus 69.2%, P < .01; 1.7 ± 1.6 mm versus 6.8 ± 5.0 mm, P < .01; 79.4% versus 0%, P < .01; 41.4 ± 79.0 U/mL versus 2079.1 ± 275.3 U/mL, P = .02).
3:::We included a group with no DD (n=649), a group with grade 1 DD (n=2875), and those with grades 2 and 3 (n=1357) who had normal ejection fraction. The prevalence of grade 2 or 3 DD with preserved ejection fraction was 25%; 95% CI: 24-26. The absolute change of ace-inhibitor use before and after the echocardiogram increased by 14, 19, 23, 27 in patients without DD, those with grade 1, grade 2 or 3 asymptomatic and grade 2 or 3 symptomatic, respectively. The use of β-blocker, statin, and diuretic had similar trends.
3:::The results from the Gen II and picoAMH assays were highly correlated, with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.91. The Passing-Bablok regression formula was picoAMH=0.01+1.69*GenII, meaning that on average picoAMH levels were 69% higher than Gen II levels. Of the 670 samples with an undetectable AMH value with the Gen II assay, AMH could be detected in 78% with the picoAMH assay, at a median concentration [interquartile range] of 0.05 [0.01-0.14] ng/mL.
3:::One hundred twenty eight children met inclusion criteria. Of these, 54 (42%) had a temporal bone anomaly, and 22 (17%) had ipsilateral BCNC stenosis. At 12 months, rates of progression in the ipsilateral ear were as follows: 12% among those without a temporal bone anomaly, 13% among those with a temporal bone anomaly, and 17% among those with BCNC stenosis. Children with BCNC stenosis had a significantly greater risk of progression in their ipsilateral ear compared with children with no stenosis: hazard ratio (HR) 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.01, 4.66), p value 0.046. When we compared children with BCNC stenosis to those with normal temporal bone imaging, we found that the children with stenosis had nearly two times greater risk estimate for progression, but this difference did not reach significance, HR 1.9, CI (0.8, 4.3), p = 0.1. No children with BCNC stenosis developed hearing loss in their contralateral year by 12 months of follow-up.
3:::A total of 43 ears, in 35 pediatric patients, met inclusion criteria. The mean age at time of implantation was 8.6 years (range, 1.4-17.8 yr), 20 (57.1%) patients were female, and 25 (58.1%) cases were left-sided.The mean preoperative ipsilateral low frequency PTA and conventional four-frequency PTA (500, 1000, 2000, 3000 Hz average) were 54.2 dB (range, 15-75 dB) and 82.2 dB (range, 25-102.5 dB), respectively. The mean low frequency PTA and conventional four-frequency PTA shifts comparing the pre- and first postoperative audiogram were Δ25.2 dB (range, -5 to 92.5 dB) and Δ18.3 dB (range, -8.8 to 100 dB), respectively. Overall, 17 (39.5%) ears demonstrated complete hearing preservation, 19 (44.2%) ears partial hearing preservation, 0 minimal hearing preservation, and 7 (16.3%) exhibited no measurable acoustic hearing after surgery. In total, 28 (65.1%) ears maintained functional low-frequency hearing (i.e., ≤85 dB LFPTA) based on the initial postoperative audiogram. There was no statistically significant difference in the initial low frequency PTA shift comparing lateral wall and perimodiolar electrodes (Δ22.2 versus Δ28.1 respectively; p = 0.44), cochleostomy and round window insertions (Δ25.2 vs. Δ24.7 respectively; p = 0.95), or statistically significant association between age at implantation and low frequency PTA shift (r = 0.174; p = 0.26).In total, 22 ears in 19 patients had serial audiometric data available for review. Over a mean duration of 43.8 months (range, 2.6-108.3 mo) following surgery, the mean low frequency PTA and conventional four-frequency PTA shift comparing the initial postoperative and most recent postoperative audiogram was Δ9.7 dB (range, -27.5 to 57.5 dB) and Δ8.1 dB (range, -18.8 to 31.9 dB), respectively.
3:::Of the 1152 patients (1743 breasts) reviewed, 855 patients (1333 breasts) had complete data for BRA-score calculations and were included for analysis. Hosmer-Lemeshow tests for calibration demonstrated a good agreement between observed and predicted outcomes for surgical site infection (SSI) and seroma models (P-values of 0.33 and 0.16, respectively). In contrast, predicted rates of explantation deviated from observed rates (Hosmer-Lemeshow P-value of 0.04). C statistics demonstrated good discrimination for SSI, seroma, and explantation (0.73, 0.69, and 0.78, respectively).
3:::Among 490 patients (mean age 64.2±15.86 years; 51.2% male; 63.3% White) included for analysis, 58 (11.8%) were disabled (modified Rankin Scale score of >2) at 3 months. In unadjusted analysis, the highest volume quartile remained a significant predictor of 1 HRQOL domain, applied cognition-general concerns (R(2)=0.06; P<0.001). Our fully adjusted prediction model explained 32% to 51% of the variance in HRQOL: upper extremity (R(2)=0.32), lower extremity (R(2)=0.51), executive function (R(2)=0.45), and general concerns (R(2)=0.34).
3:::Thematic analysis showed planners need to build a partnership based on mutual trust and respect with a person with complex support needs and harness a range of skills to respond to individual support needs, learning capacity, systemic hurdles and life challenges.
3:::A total of 145 cases met the inclusion criteria, while 123 (84.8%) patients had follow-up data available. Of these patients, 67.5% underwent FNA as the only pathologic diagnostic modality. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the detection of cystic neoplasms were 41.6%, 99.0%, 90.9%, and 87.6%, respectively. For cases containing mucin, 100.0% sensitivity and specificity were achieved.
3:::Healthy controls showed a widespread functional network modulated by the perception of fearful faces that encompassed bilateral amygdalae, limbic, cortical, subcortical and brainstem regions. In patients with left MTLE, a downsized network of frontal and temporal regions centered on the right amygdala was present. Patients with right MTLE showed almost no significant functional connectivity. A maintained network in the epilepsy control group indicates that findings in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy could not be explained by clinical factors such as seizures and antiepileptic medication.
3:::We revealed that CXCR4 expression was significantly higher in patients with squamous cell carcinomas (P=0.002) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.038), while CCR7 expression was significantly elevated in patients with lymph node metastasis (P=0.037). VEGF-C expression was markedly up-regulated in patients exhibiting FIGO stage II-III tumors (P=0.015) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.038), while VEGF-D expression was obviously increased in patients displaying FIGO stage II-III tumors (P=0.025), squamous carcinomas (P=0.017) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.037). The correlation analysis indicated that CXCR4, CCR7, VEGF-C and VEGF-D expression have a significant correlation to each other.
3:::Serum NEO, CRP levels and LAP index were significantly increased in nonobese adolescents and younger aged females with PCOS compared to healthy controls. We could not found any predictive effect of investigated inflammatory markers and LAP index on CVD risk among PCOS patients after adjustment for abdominal obesity. We also found a positive predictive effect of WBC and a negative predictive effect of lymphocytes on IR in PCOS patients after adjustment for abdominal obesity. We did not find any predictor effect of NEO on IR, but it was a positive predictive marker for an elevated HOMA-IR index.
3:::The final analysis included 28 of 31 societies representing 27 countries (response rate 90%). The median formal duration of training was 5 years (range 4-7). There were mandatory requirements in addition to medical school graduation before specialisation could be started in 20 (71%) countries. The job opportunities after completion of training varied and included academic fellowships (n=21 [75%]), clinical fellowships/junior consultancy (n=21 [75%]), consultancy (n=11 [40%]), and private practice (n=23 [82%)]. Training and working as a specialist abroad was uncommon (≤20% in 21 [78%] and 26 [96%] countries respectively). Exams during ObGyn training were offered in 24 (85%) countries. Unemployment after completion of training was rare (<5% in 26 [93%] countries). Assessment of ObGyn specialists took place in 20 (71%) countries.
3:::The top-three messages these new to the profession registered nurses would use to recruit high-school leavers to the profession were opportunity', 'rewarding' and 'travel'. The three core images identified were those depicting 'care', 'opportunity' and 'task, technical, technology and role'.'
3:::There were 64 adult patients who were studied with multiple rib fractures caused by blunt chest trauma. Of these patients, 54 (84.4%) were male and 10 (15.6%) were female. Motorcycle (popularly known as ""okada"") and tricycle (popularly known as keke napep) accidents significantly accounted for the majority of the multiple rib fractures, that is, in 50 (78.1%) of the patients. Before analgesic administration, no patient had a normal respiratory rate, but at 1 h following the administration of analgesic, 21 (32.8%) of patients recorded normal respiratory rates and there was a significant reduction in the number (10.9% vs. 39.1%) of patients with respiratory rates> 30 breaths/min. Before commencement of analgesic, no patient recorded up to 99% of oxygen saturation (SpO2) as measured by pulse oximeter, while 43.8% recorded SpO2of 96%. This improved after 1 h of administration of analgesics to SpO2of 100% in 18.8% of patients and 99% in 31.3% of patients and none recording SpO2of < 97% (P = 0.006). Before analgesia, no patient was able to achieve peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) value> 100% of predicted while only 9 (14.1%) patients were able to achieve a PEFR value in the range of 91%-100% of predicted value. One hour after analgesia, a total of 6 (9.4%) patients were able to achieve PEFR values> 100% predicted, while 35 (54.7%) patients achieved PEFR values in the range of 91%-100% predicted.
3:::The mean age of participants was 48.3 ± 13.9 years and 50.6% were men. The ACA decreased with age whereas ICSA, IT, and IC increased with age. The ACA (P = 0.0001nasally and temporally), ICSA (P = 0.011 nasally, P = 0.027 temporally), IT750 (P = 0.001 nasally, P = 0.011 temporally), IT1500 (P = 0.002 nasally, P = 0.002 temporally), and IC (P = 0.059 nasally, P = 0.128 temporally) underwent statistically significant changes with increasing age. No significant difference was seen in parameters of different sex.
3:::Out of 120 patients, 29 patients were HAP and 91 patients were VAP. Mortality was 60% (72), and development of VAP and requirement of mechanical ventilation showed significant association with mortality (P < 0.00001). Most common organism causing HAP was Staphylococcus aureus (43.4%) and VAP was Klebsiella pneumoniae (49%). Maximum antibiotic sensitivity was found to piperacillin + tazobactam (58.8%), followed by imipenem (49.5%) and meropenem (41.8%), whereas maximum antibiotic resistance was found to cefepime (95.1%), followed by ceftazidime and amoxicillin (91.2%).
3:::Fifteen centers and 42 ROs participated. Overall, the median Dice similarity coefficient was 0.66. Statistically significant differences were observed according to the level of expertise (better agreement for J and E, worse for S); the axillary level (better agreement for L1 and L4, worse for L3); the patient (better agreement for P1, worse for P3). Statistically significant differences in contouring were found in 18% of the inter-center comparison. Less than a half of the centers could claim to have a good agreement between the internal ROs.
3:::Forty-nine patients were included. Causes of hypoglycemia were various, mainly including insulin or oral antidiabetic drugs abuse (65%) and neuroendocrine carcinoma (16%). Twenty (41%) patients died in the ICU, two (4%) patients further died and nine (18%) patients had a poor outcome at long-term follow-up. Five patients discharged from the ICU with mRS > 3 improved enough to be in the good outcome group 1 year later. Twenty-two (45%) patients underwent therapeutic limitation, mainly related to no expected hope for improvement. On multivariate analysis, only low mRS prior to ICU admission (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.1-6.3; P = 0.03) and normal brain imaging (OR 7.1; 95% CI 1.1-44; P = 0.03) were significantly predictive of a good outcome. All patients (n = 15) who remained hypoglycemic >480 min had a poor outcome.
3:::During the study, 27 silicone Y-stents were placed. The mean (standard deviation) age of the study population (85.2% males) was 57.7 (13.5) years. The stents were placed for airway obstruction in 77.8% and TEF in 29.6% of the patients. The most common underlying disease was carcinoma of the esophagus. The degree of airway obstruction was grade 3-4 in 18 subjects, and respiratory failure was encountered in 18 subjects. The stent was deployed successfully in all the subjects. No deaths were encountered during stent placement. Most subjects had rapid relief of symptoms following the procedure. Excessive secretions and mucostasis were the most common stent-related complications followed by the development of granulation tissue. The systematic review yielded nine studies (338 subjects with airway obstruction and/or TEF). The most common indication for silicone Y-stent placement was tracheobronchial obstruction and TEF due to malignancy. Benign disorders that necessitated stent placement included postintubation tracheal stenosis, airway malacia, and others. The stent was successfully placed in 98% with only one periprocedural death. Granulation tissue formation and mucostasis were the most common stent-related complications.
3:::We followed 262 patients to 6 months, with a mean age of 59 ± 16 years, and of whom 175 (67%) were men. Moderate or severe disability was reported in 65 of 262 (25%). Predictors of disability included a history of anxiety/depression [odds ratio (OR) 1.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22, 2.23), P = 0.001]; being separated or divorced [OR 2.87 (CI 1.35, 6.08), P = 0.006]; increased duration of mechanical ventilation [OR 1.04 (CI 1.01, 1.08), P = 0.03 per day]; and not being discharged to home from the acute hospital [OR 1.96 (CI 1.01, 3.70) P = 0.04]. Moderate or severe disability at 6 months was associated with limitation in activities, e.g. not returning to work or studies due to health (P < 0.002), and reduced health-related quality of life (P < 0.001).
3:::A total of 27,532 patients from 1179 participating hospitals met the inclusion criteria. Generalized linear mixed models demonstrated that the odds of achieving pCR was independently associated with more recent diagnosis, female sex, private insurance, lower grade, lower clinical T classification, lower clinical N classification, increasing interval between the end of radiation and surgery, and treatment at higher-volume institutions.
3:::In total, 196 patients were included (mean age 76.7 years, SD 4.9, 54% male), with a mean of 9.5 (SD 4.1) medications per patient. The majority (96.3%) believed strongly in the necessity of their medication, while 33.9% reported strong concerns. Qualitative data confirmed these coexisting positive and negative attitudes to medications and suggested the importance of patients trust in GPs in establishing positive beliefs and potential willingness to deprescribe.'
3:::Participants indicated that the method of testing, timing, and the way the staff member approached the topic were important aspects to patients being offered 3Cs and HIV. Participants displayed a clear preference for 3Cs and HIV to be offered at the GP practice over other sexual health service providers. Participants highlighted convenience of the practice, assurance of confidentiality, and that the sexual health discussion was appropriate and routine. Barriers identified for patients were embarrassment, unease, lack of time, religion, and patients believing that certain patients could take offence. Suggested facilitators include raising awareness, reassuring confidentiality, and ensuring the offer is made in a professional and non-judgemental way at the end of the consultation.
3:::By the end of 25 rTMS treatments, the ACTIVE (n=15) treatment group showed a clinically significant reduction in the HARS scores compared to the SHAM (n=25) group. Hedges g at visit 4 (following 25 rTMS treatments) was 2.1 between ACTIVE and SHAM treatments. Furthermore, at 2 and 4weeks follow-up (after the end of treatment) HARS scores of the ACTIVE group remained stable and even slightly improved, demonstrating a sustained effect of the response.'
3:::Forty-one (63.1%) patients were males, whereas 24 (36.9%) were females. Age range is between 5 and 75 years, average of 30.8 years. Lower limb involvement was recorded in 40 (61.5%) patients, with remaining 25 (38.5%) patients in upper limbs. 28 (43.1%) patients had benign lesion, whereas 37 (56.9%) were malignant. Giant cell tumor (GCT) was the most frequent benign tumor (50%) while osteogenic sarcomas top the list on the malignant variety (32.4%). The most commonly affected bones were tibia, carpal-metacarpal, and femur in that order.
3:::Of 66,275 patients, overall prevalence of potentially inappropriate use of OAB antimuscarinics was higher using 2015 Beers Criteria than when using the 2012 Beers Criteria (25.0 vs. 20.6%). Dementia was the most common PIM-qualifying condition under both versions. The 2015 Beers Criteria identified more females, more White people, and a younger population with PIM. Comorbid medical condition burden was lower using the 2015 Beers Criteria. The 2015 Beers Criteria only group had lower median unadjusted healthcare costs ($7104 vs. 8301; p < 0.001). The incremental net cost associated with potentially inappropriate use of antimuscarinic medication was higher under the 2012 Beers Criteria than under the 2015 Beers Criteria.
3:::There was no statistically significant difference in NO and adrenomedullin levels, neither between the groups nor ADHD subtypes. A positive correlation between adrenomedullin and NO levels was found in both the case (r = 0.659) and the control groups (r = 0.494).
3:::Results demonstrated that after treatment with FIR, tumor marker (CA153, CA125) concentrations in both the FIR and control groups were not elevated. There was no statistically significant difference between FIR and control group marker expression (p>0.05). Furthermore, no patients were diagnosed with lymphadenectasis or newly enlarged lymph nodes in these two groups. Importantly, there were no adverse events in either group. The in vitro experiment indicated that FIR radiation does not affect viability, proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis of fibroblasts, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.
3:::Mice developed NASH after fed with CL diet for 12 weeks. Honokiol supplementation alleviated insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis induced by CL diet. Immunohistochemistry showed honokiol induced more M2 macrophages in livers compared with CL diet alone. Honokiol decreased M1 marker genes (TNFα, MCP-1), increased M2 marker genes (YM-1, IL-10, IL-4R, IL-13) expression in mice liver compared with CL diet. Moreover, treatment with honokiol lowered ALT and AST in serum and preserved liver from lipid peroxidation, evidenced by lowered hepatic MDA level. Honokiol has antioxidant function, as honokiol upregulated hepatic GSH and SOD level and downregulated hepatic CYP2E1 protein level. Hepatic PPARγ and its target genes were upregulated by honokiol. Furthermore, honokiol (10 μM) treatment in mouse peritoneal cells, RAW264.7 cells and ANA-1 cells led to M2 macrophage polarization, whereas a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662 abolished this effect of honokiol.
3:::CIPROS is based on 64 publications and covers twelve sections with a total of 72 items. CIPROS also defines software requirements. Comparing CIPROS with traditional software requirements elicitation methods, SRS templates and standards show a broad consensus but differences in issues regarding registry-specific aspects.
3:::The literature provided information on ethnopharmacological uses of the South American and African species of the genus Hymenaea (e.g., H. courbaril, H. stigonocarpa, H. onblogifolia, H. martiana, H. parvifolia (South America) and H. verrucosa (African species)) for the treatment of multi-factorial diseases. From these plant species, more than 130 compounds, including fatty acids, flavonoids, terpenoids and steroids, phthalides, phenolic acids, procyanidins and coumarins were identified. Experimental evidences confirmed that the Hymenaea spp. could be used in treating inflammatory disorders, asthma, diarrhea, and some microbial infections. However, reports on the toxicity of Hymenaea species remain scarce.
3:::At both irradiation times, none of the bulk-fill composites significantly affected comet assay parameters used in primary DNA damage assessment or induced significant formation of any of the scored chromatin abnormalities (number of micronuclei, nuclear buds, nucleoplasmic bridges), whether eluates were obtained from the top or bottom surface. Furthermore, no decrease in KHN from the top to the bottom surface of the bulk-fill materials was observed. On the other hand, the conventional composite irradiated for 20s showed at 4-mm depth a significant increase in the percentage of DNA that migrated in the tail and a significant increase in the number of nuclear buds, as well as a significant decrease in KHN relative to the top surface.
3:::Rotor-based VF exhibited greater voltage variation than focal source-based VF in both the primary analysis (n = 8, 110±24% vs 55±32%, p = 0.02) and the secondary analysis (n = 18, 103±30% vs 67±34%, p = 0.009). Computational VF simulations also revealed greater voltage variation in rotors compared to focal sources (110±19% vs 33±16%, p = 0.001), and demonstrated that this variation was due to wavebreak, secondary rotor initiation, and rotor meander.
3:::Age at initial evaluation was 56.3±13.7years. Among 432 Thessaly residents, prevalence was 582/million (non-homogeneous distribution). Nineteen districts showed a prevalence >800/million. Symptomatic disease onset could be identified in 91 patients, with a significant peak during spring (P=0.03). At diagnosis, 43.6% were asymptomatic and 16.2% cirrhotic. Male sex (P=0.02), older age (P<0.001), alcohol consumption (P<0.01) and concomitant liver disease (P<0.001) were negative prognostic factors for cirrhosis. During a median [interquartile range, range] follow-up of 5.1 (7.8, 15.7) years, 62 patients died or underwent liver transplantation. Patients with GLOBE score>0.30 had significantly worse prognosis (P<0.001) with 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates of 84%, 50% and 42%.
3:::Across the nine Rangipo strains, a total of 727 single-locus variants were identified with respect to H37Rv, of which 700 were common to all Rangipo strains sequenced. Within the common variants, 386 were non-synonymous, with 12 occurring in genes associated with M. tuberculosis virulence. Next-generation and Sanger sequencing determined the presence of three genes in the Rangipo isolates, which are absent in H37Rv, but which have been reported to be important for the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis. The differentially encoded Rangipo genes consisted of transcriptional regulator EmbR2, and molybdopterin cofactor biosynthesis proteins A and B. The Rangipo strain also harbours an extended DNA helicase and an additional adenylate cyclase.
3:::Prenatal NO2 exposure was inversely associated with all infant growth parameters. A 10µg/m³ increment in prenatal NO2 exposure during trimester 1 of pregnancy was significantly inversely associated with height at 6 months of age (-6.6%; 95%CI: -11.4, -1.9) and weight at 1 year of age (-4.2%; 95%CI: -8.3, -0.1). These associations were mediated by birth length (31.7%; 95%CI: 34.5, 14.3) and weight (53.7%; 95%CI: 65.3, -0.3), respectively. Furthermore, 5.5% (95%CI: 10.0, -0.2) of the association between trimester 1 NO2 exposure and length at 6 months of age could be mediated by placental mtDNA content.
3:::Excellent interexaminer reliability of clinician judgement, ABO-DI and PAR index was demonstrated by the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (rho= 0.995, 0.990 and 0.964, respectively). Both the ABO-DI and US-PAR index showed good correlation with clinician judgement (r=.700 and r=.707, respectively). There was variability among the different Angle classifications: the ABO-DI showed the highest correlation with clinician judgement in Class II patients (r=.780), whereas the US-PAR index showed the highest correlation with clinician judgement in Class III patients (r=.710). Both indices demonstrated the lowest correlations with clinician judgement in Class I patients.
3:::Of 793 non-participants, 28% were unaware of screening, 15% had decided not to attend and 51% were intending to have screening but were currently overdue. Younger women were more likely to be unaware of screening or to intend to be screened, while older women were more likely to have decided not to be screened. Women from ethnic minority backgrounds were more likely to be unaware of screening than white women. Being in a lower social grade was associated with increased odds of all three types of non-participation.
3:::Alterations of nerve excitability strongly correlated with scores of muscle strength. CPEO-weak displayed abnormal nerve excitability compared to CPEO-normal and healthy controls, with increased superexcitability and responses to hyperpolarizing current. Modeling indicated that the CPEO-weak recordings were best explained by an increase in the Barrett-Barrett' conductance across the myelin sheath.'
3:::Cox regression modeling estimates showed excess mortality for drinkers with age of first drunkenness earlier than 15 years old (hazard ratio, HR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.25, 1.72) and when first drunkenness occurred at or after age 15 (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.29), as compared with adults who had never been drunk. Consistent results were observed, irrespective of AUD history. That is, early drunkenness signaled excess mortality risk even in absence of AUD.
3:::Only one of 65 studied preterm neonates had normal vitamin D level. Neonates with RDS had significantly lower mean serum 25(OH)D level than controls (10.6 vs. 13.9 ng/dl) (p value =0.028). Neonates with severe 25(OH)D deficiency developed more BPD than those with moderate deficiency (29.4 vs. 8.7%) but did not reach significant level (p value =0.08). There is no correlation between serum 25(OH)D level and duration of mechanical ventilation. Logistic regression analysis shows that low serum 25(OH)D level is an independent risk factor for RDS.
3:::Multigroup CFAs provided support for full configural and metric invariance and partial scalar invariance for the three-factor model across gender groups. Two of the 14 items (#3 and #18) demonstrated different thresholds; women scored higher than men in both items. The pattern of latent correlations of the three depression factors to four stress variables (college academic, social, financial and discrimination stress) demonstrated configural, metric and scalar invariance across gender groups.
3:::27 patients (20.93%) used topical tacrolimus in proper amounts (A/E: 0.8-1.2). However, 86 patients (66.67%) underused topical tacrolimus; 16 (12.40%) patients overused topical tacrolimus. Decreases in EASI scores between baseline and 2 weeks of follow-up in each group (under-amount, proper amount, over-amount) were 1.64, 4.65 and 4.21, respectively. Treatment efficacy increased in accordance with application amount. Further, TIS, IGA, PGA, VAS for Itch and DLQI scores improved concomitantly, exhibiting similar tendencies.
3:::The p24 limit of detection (LOD) for the WHO standard was 0.19IU/ml, 0.70IU/ml, and 1.77IU/ml in BioPlex, ARCHITECT, and Centaur respectively. The distribution of LODs across 15 HIV-1 isolates was substantially narrower in ARCHITECT (5-33pg/ml) than in BioPlex (11-198pg/ml) and Centaur (6-384pg/ml). All assays detected antibodies to the majority of HIV-1 and HIV-2 variants. However, reduced sensitivity was observed for Centaur in detection of antibodies to HIV-1 group M (CRF02_AG), O and N variants. BioPlex and ARCHITECT showed better seroconversion sensitivity than Centaur, detecting one bleed (3-7 days) earlier in 4 (BioPlex) and 3 (ARCHITECT) of 6 seroconversion panels. ARCHITECT demonstrated the highest specificity (99.90-100%) compared to BioPlex (99.80%) and Centaur (99.42%).
3:::The mean BSI-18 depression score was 51.4 (9.7). Of the 170 (16%) patients screening positive for dPD on the BSI-18, 104 (61%) were not recognized as depressed by neurologists on the UPDRS. Factors associated with lower neurologist recognition included male gender, better mental health quality of life, and lack of antidepressant use.
3:::The most common cognitive findings were executive, visuospatial, and naming dysfunction in DM1, and executive and naming dysfunction in DM2. FDG-PET showed the most prominent glucose hypometabolism in prefrontal, temporal, and pericentral regions in both DM1 and DM2 patients, with additional affection of insula and subcortical grey matter in DM2. In DM1 patients, we found association between right frontotemporal hypometabolism and executive dysfunction (p<0.05). In DM2 patients attention deficit was in association with prefrontal, insular, and striatal hypometabolism, as well as right frontotemporal hypometabolism (p<0.05). Executive dysfunction in DM2 was more common in patients with prefrontal and insular hypometabolism, right parietotemporal and frontotemporal hypometabolism, as well as left striatal hypometabolism (p<0.05). Patients with parietotemporal defect on FDG-PET were more likely to have naming dysfunction (p<0.01).
3:::Between September 1990 and June 2016, 850 procedures for unusual cases were performed in 781 patients, in 53 centres worldwide. Nearly two-thirds of the procedures were performed for three indications: rare ovarian carcinoma (n = 224), sarcoma (n = 189) and neuroendocrine tumours (n = 127). The median PCI was 12 [0-39]. Grade III-IV postoperative complications occurred in 272 patients (41%). Nineteen patients (2.9%) died postoperatively. After a median follow-up of 46 months, median overall survival (OS) was 39 months [33.18-44.05]. Five-year OS rate was 38.7%. For the three main indications, 5-year OS was significantly greater in patients with PM from rare ovarian carcinoma (57.7%), than that of patients with PM from neuroendocrine tumours (39.9%), and from sarcoma (29.3%) (p < 0.0001).
3:::A total of 26 studies were eligible for inclusion. Results showed that sporotrichosis was the most common subcutaneous mycosis (99.7%), whereas lobomycosis, chromoblastomycosis, and subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis were rare. Cases of eumycetoma and subcutaneous zygomycosis were not found. Of the 25 regions, the burden of sporotrichosis was estimated for four regions classified as endemic; in nine regions, only isolated cases were reported. The highest burden of sporotrichosis was in Apurimac (15 cases/100,000 inhabitants; 57 cases/year), followed by Cajamarca (3/100,000 inhabitants; 30/year), Cusco (0.5/100,000 inhabitants; 4/year), and La Libertad (0.2/100,000 inhabitants; 2/year). In two regions, the mycoses predominantly affected children.
3:::Adults born small for gestational age at term had lower performances in subtests assessing attention and executive functions. They also showed smaller total intracranial volume; smaller volumes and surface areas in the frontal lobe, inferior/middle parietal and temporal gyrus; smaller cerebellum, thalamus and basal ganglia volumes. Interestingly, all these structures correlated with attention subtests.
3:::A significant increase from baseline was observed in peak knee contact force during the weight-acceptance phase of gait after 30 and 45min of walking, irrespective of the walking exercise condition. Additionally, whereas continuous walking resulted in an increase in knee pain, interval walking did not lead to increased knee pain.
3:::The overall rate of positive perception towards orthodontic treatment was 48.5%. Compared to adults in their 20s (63.2%), those in their 40s and 50s had a lower percentage of interest in orthodontic treatment (46.2% and 45.1%, respectively; p < 0.05). Overall, women (52.2%) had a higher rate of interest than did men (42.6%; p < 0.05). The area of living had no effect on the percentage of interest. The order of priority of chief complaints differed according to age: protrusion for those in the 20s and 30s, and spacing for those in the 40s to 60s. Overall, the main reason for not seeking treatment was the treatment fee. Respondents aged over 40 considered themselves ""too old"" for orthodontic treatment.
3:::The literature search resulted in data on the incidence of a TPS in 26 tumours. For 23/26 tumour types, a TPS incidence of 5% or higher was reported. In addition, during the consensus meeting the experts agreed that children with any carcinoma should always be referred for clinical genetic consultation as well, as it may point to a TPS.
3:::1372 patients (1.48%) had a first seizure or epilepsy diagnosis registered less than ten years prior to the index stroke. The mean latency between seizure and stroke was 1474days (SD 1029 days).
3:::There were no statistically significant differences between zirconia micro-implants and titanium alloy implants with regard to MIT, MRT, or the amount of movement in the angulated lateral displacement test. As angulation increased, the mean compressive and tensile forces required to displace both types of micro-implants increased substantially at all distances. The average bone-to-implant contact ratio of prototype zirconia micro-implants was 56.88 ± 6.72%.
3:::Autophagy and ER stress were enhanced in the week after ICH. At 6 hours after ICH, autophagy was excessive, while the autophagic flux was damaged at 72 hours and return to be intact at 7 days after ICH. At 6 hours after ICH, ER stress induction by TM could enhance autophagy and lead to caspase 12-mediated apoptosis and neuronal degeneration, which was further aggravated by autophagy induction. At 7 days after ICH, ER stress inhibition by TUDCA still could suppress ICH-induced SBI. And, the effects of TUDCA were enhanced by autophagy induction.
3:::Statistically significant improvement was observed in mean percentage change in erythema, scaling, and induration (ESI) (P = 0.048) in metformin as compared to placebo while mean percentage change in psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) and physician global assessment (PGA) scores was not significant (PASI - P = 0.215, PGA - P = 0.070). There was a statistically significant difference in percentage of parameters of MS improved following 12 weeks of treatment in metformin (19%) as compared to placebo (8.9%) group (P = 0.046). Statistically significant difference in percentage of patients achieving 75% reduction in ESI scores (P = 0.024). Significant improvement was observed in mean weight, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in metformin group as compared to placebo. Improvement in BMI, fasting plasma glucose, serum triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, LDL, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol was statistically significant in metformin group over the period of 12 weeks. There was no significant difference in adverse events in two groups except weight gain.
3:::Three heterogeneous clusters of craniofacial patterns were obtained in relation to age: cluster 1 (41.9%) included patients aged 5-8 years with a skeletal Class I or mild Class II and hyperdivergent pattern; cluster 2 (45.3%) included patients aged 9-12 years with a Class II and hyperdivergent pattern; and cluster 3 (12.8%) included patients aged 7-8 years with a Class III and hyperdivergent pattern.
3:::Data are presented as median and range. The 95% confidence intervals for differences of means (95% CI) are given for the mean difference from baseline values. We observed a correlation between intrathoracic pressure exceeding 4 mm Hg and transient decrease in regional cerebral oxygen saturation of 12.7% (95% CI: 9.7-17.2, P<.001). Peripheral oxygen saturation was normal at the same time. Intraoperative increase in arterial paCO2 (median maximum value: 48.8 mm Hg, range: [36.5-65.4]; 95% CI: -16.0 to -3.0, P=.002) and decrease in arterial pH (median minimum value: 7.3, range: [7.2-7.4]; 95% CI: 0.04-0.12, P=.008) were observed during thoracoscopy with both parameters recovering at the end of the procedure. Periods of regional cerebral oxygen saturation below 20% from baseline were significantly more frequent during thoracoscopy as compared to the control group (median maximum value: 1.3%min/h, range: [0.0-66.2] vs median maximum value: 0.0%min/h, range: [0.0-4.0]; 95% CI: -16.6 to -1.1, P=.028).
3:::Because of donor and government funding, no payments were made for antiretroviral drugs. Other health expenditures were about $66 per person per year (95% CI: $30-$102), of which $15 ($7-$22) were directly for HIV-related health services, largely laboratory tests. These payments resulted in a 4.9% (95% CI: 3.1-6.8%) catastrophic payment rate and 2.5% (95% CI: 0.9-4.1%) catastrophic payment rate for HIV-related health services. About 32% of respondents reported, they were eligible for SHI without copayments. If patients had to pay 20% of costs of ART under social health insurance, the catastrophic payment rate would increase to 8% (95% CI: 5.5-10.0%), and if patients without health insurance had to pay the full costs of ART, the catastrophic payment rate among all patients would be 24% (95% CI: 21.1-27.4%).
3:::A total of 1,150 questionnaires were collected, excluding the participants with missing values in the CTS1. Finally, 1,078 were included in the statistical analyses. Data of 1,078 women were divided into two parts. In the first halved sample (n=578), an exploratory factor analysis was conducted for the CTS1 items after exluding nine items with extremely low prevalence. It revealed 2-factor or 3-factor models. Then, we conducted a model comparison with the second halved sample (n=500), using confirmatory factor analysis. In terms of goodness-of-fit indeces, the 2-factor model was superior. Its subscales were Reasoning and Psycholosical Aggression.
3:::Nine hundred thirty adults (29% of those approached) participated. Mean age was 43 years, 58% were male and 16% of South Asian ethnicity. Most participants were either overweight or obese (68%). Diabetes status was successfully assessed for 675 (73%) participants: Nine (1.3%, 95% confidence interval 0.6 to 2.5) were found to have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, and 35 (5.2%, 95% confidence interval 3.6 to 7.1) had impaired glucose regulation. Key factors associated with abnormal glucose regulation included the following: non-white ethnicity and a first degree family history of diabetes.
3:::Findings indicate that 58.5 percent of Community Health Workers had good knowledge about causes of child abuse and 45 percent had good knowledge of the signs, symptoms and complications of child abuse. Their total knowledge was good (57%). The mean score of awareness (knowledge) was significant according to the variable of training participation (P=0.04). The participants had a favorable attitude toward dealing with child abuse (91.3 %); the mean score of attitude was significant according to the educational field (P<0.001) and their performance in dealing with child abuse was moderate and lower (94.3 %).
3:::Sixty-four of the neurologists replied. Overall, they expressed support for the recommendations, in particular open communication with patients, open assessment of patient and family needs, and discussion of dying. There was less understanding of the role of palliative care in the implementation of palliative care early in disease progression and the role of palliative care multidisciplinary teams.
3:::The initially developed scale consisted of 60 items on a 5-point Likert scale, which reduced to 43 items following measurement of the face and content validity. The results of the exploratory factor analysis elicited 36 items and a seven-factor structure including motivational beliefs on vaginal delivery, social beliefs towards childbirth, motivational beliefs on cesarean delivery, personal beliefs, sources of information, catastrophic thinking and child birth experiences. Cronbachs alpha coefficient (0.80) confirmed the high internal consistency of the scale.'
3:::Experiences of the participants were divided into three main categories as follows: (1) disease shadow; (2) dual understanding of the effect of drug therapy consisting of two sub-categories known as 'perceived benefits,'' ''negative consequences''; and (3) facing the disease that includes the two subcategories of ''Compatibility'' and ''Negligence and denial''.'
3:::From 2001 to 2009, 126 528 DMPA and 651 356 CHC episodes were used for segmented regression. For the DMPA cohort, there was an immediate decline in the mean duration (-34.7 days [confidence interval: -45.4 to -24.1]) and episodes >2 years (-1.9% [confidence interval: -2.9% to -1.1%]) after the boxed warning. We did not observe any change in mean duration or episodes >2 years for the CHC cohort. The largest declines in mean duration and proportion >2 years were seen with the oldest women.
3:::Smoking abstinence state (versus satiety) was associated with increased RSFC between right AI and right medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex as well as anterior cingulate cortex. The abstinence-induced RSFC changes between right AI and right lateral OFC was significantly correlated with the craving changes.
3:::DM/TB co-morbidity was noted in 85 individuals and these made up 15.4% of the study population. The mean age was higher in DM patients with TB (43.4 ± 15.4 vs. 33.1 ± 16.2 years, P = 0.000); the mean duration of symptoms of TB with DM was more (124 ± 16.4 vs. 107.49 ± 10.3 days). Multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that increasing age, positive family history of diabetes, sedentary occupation, and presence of pulmonary TB were significantly associated with diabetes among TB patients.
3:::Mean age of study population was 54.81 ± 9.10 years. Sixty-five percent (65.5%) of atorvastatin users had coronary heart disease, 62.5% were hypertensive, 38% had diabetes. Thirty-five percent (35.5%) patients were taking 10 mg/day atorvastatin, 45% were taking 20 mg/day, and 19.5% were taking 40 mg/day. The overall frequency of myopathy among statin users was 7.5% which was significantly higher with increasing dose of atorvastatin (1.4% in 10 mg/day group, 10% in 20 mg/day group, and 12.8% in 40 mg/day, P < 0.05). The frequency of atorvastatin-related myopathy was higher in females 8.65% compared to 6.25% in males. Serum TSH levels in patients with myopathy were 4.05 ± 7.76 μIU/ml while in those without myopathy were 3.13 ± 2.88 μIU/ml (P = 0.649). Serum 25-hydroxy Vitamin D levels were measured in 66 patients randomly. Mean levels in patients with myopathy were 15.98 ± 12.94 ng/ml and without myopathy were 10.20 ± 5.64 ng/ml (P = 0.285).
3:::Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) showed BNNTs with diameter ranging from 5 to 10nm with close end tips. No changes in DC were observed after incorporating BNNTs up to 0.15wt%. The contact angles of water and α-bromonaphthalene increased (p<0.05) and consequently the SFE decreased after incorporating BNNTs to the polymer matrix. Microhardness and solvent degradation strength increased after incorporation of 0.075, 0.1 and 0.15wt% BNNTs. Mineral deposition was found after 7days of immersion on adhesive specimens after incorporation of BNNT.
3:::Forty patients were included in the study, functional outcome scores were available for 30 patients (response rate 75%). Additional surgery of the fused foot was performed in 29 patients and 15 suffered multiple lower extremity injuries. Six patients were polytraumatized. Ninety percent of all patients would recommend the procedure to others, walking abilities improved in 69% and less pain was experienced in 76%. Median MFS score was 61 (IQR 53-72). Quality of life was significantly lower when compared to a reference population (p<0.001).
3:::Pearson correlation coefficients between mREE and the anthropometric variables showed positive significance with suprailiac skinfold thickness, lean body mass (LBM), waist circumference, hip circumference, bone mineral mass, and body mass. All eight predictive equations underestimated the REE of the weightlifters when compared with the mREE. The highest mean difference was 636 kcal/day (Owen, 1986) and the lowest difference was 375 kcal/day (Cunninghams, 1980). Multiple linear regression done stepwise showed that LBM was the only significant determinant of REE in this group of sportspersons. A new equation using LBM as the independent variable for calculating REE was computed. REE for weightlifters = -164.065 + 0.039 (LBM) (confidence interval -1122.984, 794.854]. This new equation reduced the mean difference with mREE by 2.36 + 369.15 kcal/day (standard error = 67.40).
3:::The average age of the patient was 38 (17-70). All 76 patients progressed to union. The average time until union was 148 (55-398) days. The coronal and sagittal alignment was 3° (0-17°) and 4° (0-14°) respectively. No patient suffered from compartment syndrome. No patient developed septic arthritis. No patient had documented anterior knee pain or secondary knee specialist input post frame removal. On average, there were 9(4-29) follow up appointments and 10(5-26) radiographs post frame application. There is a 59% chance of a patient having a difficulty post frame application. The malunion rate was 5%. Persisting pinsite infection post frame removal occurred in 5 patients (6.5%). Drilling of the pinsite sequestrum resolved the infection in four of these patients, giving a deep infection rate of 1.3%.
3:::The majority (96%) of the study participants perceived the peer support and yoga intervention to be beneficial. Paired t-test revealed significant increases in the social and environmental domain in the peer group and in the environmental domain in the yoga group, though this disappeared in the between-group comparison perhaps due to poor glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c varied from 9.4 to 9.6) and the short duration of 3 months of the study.
3:::QC exhibited strong synergism in vitro when combined with cisplatin, carboplatin or paclitaxel with the highest level of synergism in the most chemo-resistant cell line. Neither QC monotherapy nor carboplatin/paclitaxel significantly delayed tumor growth in xenografts. Combination treatment (QC plus carboplatin/paclitaxel) significantly augmented the antiproliferative ability of these agents and was associated with a 14-week survival prolongation compared to carboplatin/paclitaxel. Maintenance with QC resulted in further delay in tumor progression and survival prolongation compared to carboplatin/paclitaxel. QC was not associated with weight loss and the yellow skin discoloration noted during treatment was reversible upon discontinuation.
3:::Musically trained children showed better performance on melody discrimination, rhythm discrimination, frequency discrimination, and auditory statistical learning. Furthermore, grand-averaged ERPs showed that triplet onset (initial stimulus) elicited larger responses in the musically trained children during both auditory and visual statistical learning tasks. In addition, childrens music skills were associated with performance on auditory and visual behavioural statistical learning tasks.'
3:::Combinatorial study between γ-tocotrienol at a concentration range (0-24µg/ml) and fixed IC20 concentration of jerantinine A (0.16µg/ml) induced a potent antiproliferative effect on U87MG cells and led to a reduction on the new half maximal inhibitory concentration of γ-tocotrienol (i.e.tIC50=1.29µg/ml) as compared to that of individual γ-tocotrienol (i.e. IC50=3.17µg/ml). A reduction on undesirable toxicity to MRC5 normal cells was also observed. G0/G1 cell cycle arrest was evident on U87MG cells receiving IC50 of individual γ-tocotrienol and combined low-concentration compounds (1.29µg/ml γ-tocotrienol + 0.16µg/ml jerantinine A), whereas, a profound G2/M arrest was evident on cells treated with IC50 of individual jerantinine A. Additionally, individual jerantinine A and combined compounds (except individual γ-tocotrienol) caused a disruption of microtubule networks triggering Fas- and p53-induced apoptosis mediated via the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways.
3:::Pre-treatment with fisetin (50μM), fisetin (100μM), EGCG (100μM), quercetin (100μM), daidzein (50μM), and ECG (150μM) significantly reduced MNoV by 50.00±7.14 to 60.67±9.26%. The mRNA levels of IFN-α, IFN-λ, TNF-α, Mx, and ZAP were upregulated in RAW 264.7 cells pre-treated with fisetin, quercetin, and daidzein, but not in those pre-treated with EGCG or ECG. Regarding protein levels, IFN-α was significantly induced in cells pre-treated with fisetin, quercetin, and daidzein, whereas TNF-α was significantly induced only in cells pre-treated with daidzein.
3:::We found that PEITC treatment suppressed expression of the all three pluripotency factors in the NCCIT cells, in which pluripotency factors are highly expressed. Moreover, PEITC suppressed the self-renewal capacity and clonogenicity in the EpCAM-expressing CSC model. EpCAM was used as a specific CSC marker in this study. Importantly, PEITC markedly suppressed both tumor growth and expression of three pluripotency factors in a mouse xenograft model.
3:::The opposite effect on sweating of EH and ER can be attributed to the APIs of amphetamine-type alkaloids and flavonoid derivatives. Mahuannin B is an effective anti-hydrotic agent, inhibiting the production of cAMP via suppression of adenylate cyclase (AC) activity.
3:::2-(6-benzoyl-β-d-glucopyranosyloxy)-7-(1α, 2α, 6α-trihydroxy-3-oxocyclohex-4-enoyl)-5-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (CPG), a phenolic glycoside isolated from the aerial parts of F. indica was found to exhibit promising antiplasmodial activity by arresting the P. falciparum growth at the trophozoite stage. Spectroscopic investigations reveal that CPG possesses a strong binding affinity with free heme moieties. In addition, these interactions lead to the inhibition of heme polymerization in malaria parasite, augmenting oxidative stress, and delaying the rapid growth of parasite. Under in-vivo condition, CPG exhibited significant antimalarial activity against P. berghei at 50 and 75mg/kg body weight through chemo-suppression of parasitemia and ameliorating the parasite induced inflammatory and oxidative (hepatic) imbalance in the experimental mice.
3:::Of 128 females with hyperprolactinemia, 58 had prolactinoma (41 microadenoma and 17 macroadenoma) and 39 had DIH. Patients with prolactinoma had higher prolactin levels and increased frequency of oligomenorrhea (77.5% vs. 46%) as compared to DIH. Patients with macroprolactinoma had more severe menstrual disturbances compared to microprolactinoma. A higher percentage of patients with microprolactinoma and DIH achieved regular menstrual cycles compared to macroprolactinoma postcabergoline treatment (85% and 90% vs. 65%). There was no correlation between time to regularization of menstrual cycles with age, menstrual cycle length, duration of menstrual irregularity, or initial prolactin level in patients with prolactinoma. Linear regression analysis showed a significant association between time to regularization of menstrual cycles with time to normalization of prolactin levels (P = 0.001).
3:::Our data showed that GLA inhibited the production of AGEs (IC50 = 1.12 ± 0.05 μM). However, this effect was more significant at lower tested doses. A similar pattern was also observed in in vivo experiments, where the effect of fructose was reversed by GLA only at lowest tested dose of 1 mg/kg. The HbA1c levels also revealed significant reduction at lower doses (1 and 5 mg/kg). The in silico data exhibited promising interaction of GLA with active residues (Try72, Arg77 and Gln67) of RAGE.
3:::We included 66 patients; 47 patients (27 women) received ERT (ERT group) and 19 patients (15 women) did not (non-ERT group). The groups were followed for a median of 8 [0-12] years and 6 [0-13] years, respectively. Comparison between ERT and non-ERT receiving patients by left ventricular mass (echocardiographic assessment) and Sokolow-Lyon voltage- and Cornell product criteria (electrocardiographic assessment) revealed no significant differences. In the ERT group, we observed no change in left ventricular mass but a decrease in Sokolow-Lyon voltage- and Cornell product criteria from baseline to follow-up; 30 mm [15-53] vs. 25 mm [3-44], p < 0.005 and 1710 mm·ms [480-3740] vs. 1520 mm·ms [550-5740], p < .05, respectively. There were no changes within the non-ERT group. During follow-up, cardiac symptoms and use of cardiovascular procedures and -medication increased significantly in the ERT group, whereas no differences were observed within the non-ERT group.
3:::In 200 patients, mean age was 64.5 ± 7.0 years and age differed significantly in males and females (P < 0.0001). Osteoporosis was present in 35.5% adults with T2DM. Significantly greater proportion of females had osteoporosis (49.5% vs. 22.3%, P < 0.0001). Frequency of osteoporosis at spine (33.5%) was higher than the same at hip (13.5%). Compared to males, significantly greater proportion of females had osteoporosis and osteopenia at both spine (P < 0.0001) and hip (P < 0.0001). Among all parameters assessed, a significant positive correlation of T-score at spine and hip was seen with body mass index in both males (r = 0.287, P = 0.003 at spine and r = 0.421, P < 0.0001 at hip) and females (r = 0.291, P = 0.004 at spine and r = 0.280, P = 0.010 at hip). There was no association of Vitamin D deficiency (45.5% patients) with either T-score and presence of osteoporosis either at spine (P = 0.388 and P = 0.177) or hip (P = 0.431 and P = 0.593).
3:::The mean age of COPD patients was 59.29 ± 10.3 years. Serum levels of MDA and iron were significantly higher in COPD patients compared to controls (5.21 ± 1.9 vs. 0.71 ± 0.29 nmol MDA/ml, P = 0.0001 and 69.85 ± 85.49 vs. 79.32 ± 24.39 μg/dl, P = 0.0001, respectively). Mean level of all antioxidant enzymes catalase, SOD, and copper were significantly diminished in cases when compared to control population (P = 0.001). Levels of MDA and iron were found to be significantly elevated in higher Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classes (III, IV) when compared to lower GOLD Classes (I, II). The levels of serum antioxidants were significantly depleted in higher GOLD grades too. COPD patients who were male and smoked had significantly higher levels of oxidants and depleted antioxidant levels compared to female and nonsmoking compatriots. Serum MDA levels negatively correlated with forced expiratory volume 1 s and forced vital capacity (r = -0.19 and r = -0.21, P ≤ 0.01). The presence of a cough significantly correlated with higher levels of MDA and iron (P = 0.001). The levels of MDA negatively correlated with SOD and catalase levels.
3:::The mean authentic leadership perception and the safety climate scores of the nurses were 2.92 and 3.50, respectively. The percentage of problematic responses was found to be less than 10% for only four safety climate items. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that authentic leadership significantly predicted the safety climate.
3:::There were 269 bolus administrations of vasopressors (149 NA, 120 PE) in 47 patients with no adverse effects detected. A decrease in stroke volume (SV) was observed with PE compared with NA (-18 ± 9% vs. -14 ± 7%, P < 0.001). This decrease was associated with an increase in Aix, which was greater for PE than for NA (+10 ± 8% vs. +6 ± 6%, P < 0.0001), and a decrease in total arterial compliance greater for PE compared to NA (Ctot = SV/Central Pulse Pressure) (-35 ± 9% vs. -29 ± 10%, P < 0.001).
3:::On the 30th days of the experiment, serum level of magnesium and potassium decreased significantly in EG group compared with A,C,D,E and F groups (P &lt; .05), while serum level of calcium, creatinine, uric acid, sodium and urine level of calcium, creatinine, uric acid, increased significantly in EG group compared with A,C,D,E and F groups (P &lt; .05). In the prevention and treatment groups, the number of deposits decreased significantly compared with EG group on the 30th day (P &lt; .05).
3:::There were no major complications in any of our patients except in one patient who developed meatal stenosis which was treated by periodic dilatation. Three fold urethral mobilization was sufficient in all cases.
3:::We enrolled 2257 patients treated for herbicide poisoning (paraquat=46.8%). The overall and paraquat poisoning mortality rates were 40.6% and 73.0%, respectively. The decreased paraquat poisoning mortality rate (before, 75% vs. after, 67%, p=0.014) might be associated with increased intentionality. The multivariable logistic analysis revealed the paraquat ban as an independent predictor that decreased herbicide poisoning mortality (p=0.035). There were two major change points in herbicide mortality rates, approximately 3 months after the initial paraquat ban and 1 year after complete sales ban.
3:::Cronbachs alpha showed good internal consistency (0.982). Two factors were identified by factor analysis: There was a significant difference in K-SHQ scores for patients with normal hearing compared to those with hearing impairment. Patients with asymmetric hearing impairment had higher K-SHQ scores than those with symmetric hearing impairment. This is related to a lower threshold of PTA in the better ear of subjects. The hearing ability of the better ear is correlated with K-SHQ score.'
3:::Five patients underwent open reduction alone, and 17 patients underwent open reduction and ulnar osteotomy. When the MUB was less than 4 mm and the location of the MUB was in the distal 40% of the ulna, we could achieve reduction of the radial head without ulnar osteotomy. The radial head was maintained in a completely reduced position in 21 patients and was dislocated in one patient at final follow-up.
3:::The maternal Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score was positively correlated with total problem scores and externalizing scores in patients aged less than 7 years. In patients aged 7-12 years, there was no significant association between the patients emotional distress and other variables. In contrast, the maternal BDI-II score was the strongest factor associated with patient depression in adolescents.'
3:::A total of 957 paired tests using the 13 allergens were compared. The total agreement ratio ranged from 0.74 (oak) to 0.97 (Alternaria). With respect to class association analyses, the gamma index ranged from 0.819 (rye grass) to 0.990 (Alternaria). The intra-class correlation coefficients for house dust mites, cat and dog dander, Alternaria, birch, ragweed, egg white, cows milk, and peanut sIgE titers were >0.8.'
3:::During the study period, 63,258 soccer-related injuries were captured by NEISS, which translates to an estimated 2,039,250 injuries seen at US EDs nationwide. Commonly injured body parts included the head/face (19.1%), ankle (17.6%), hand/wrist (15.3%), and knee (12.2%). Common diagnoses included sprains/strains (34.0%), fractures (22.2%), and contusions (17.7%). Compared to their respective age ranges in NEISS, sprains/strains comprised a larger proportion of injuries in HS RIO (48.3% vs. 33.7%; IPR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.33, 1.42) and NCAA-ISP (51.3% vs. 37.0%; IPR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.31, 1.46). In contrast, fractures comprised a smaller proportion of injuries in HS RIO than in NEISS (7.5% vs. 18.6%; IPR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.47) and NCAA-ISP (2.8% vs. 15.7%; IPR = 0.18; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.22).
3:::The eGFR (cystatin-C) showed significant changes from 0 to 48 wks (p=0.002), with the lowest levels at 24 wks (84.3±18.8 mL/min vs. 90.3±22.5 mL/min, p=0.021 by post hoc test). Urine NAG levels did not differ at 0, 12, 24, and 48 wks, although eGFR (MDRD) significantly decreased from 0 (98.7±18.9 mL/min/1.73 m²) to 144 wks (89.0±14.7 mL/min/1.73 m²) (p=0.010). The first-line TDF group had significantly lower eGFR (MDRD) than the ART-naïve group at 144 wks (89.7 mL/min/1.73 m² vs. 98.4 mL/min/1.73 m², p=0.036). Thirteen (26%) participants experienced a decrease in renal impairment of 10 mL/min/1.73 m² in eGFR (MDRD) at 144 wks.
3:::There were 119 NERD patients and 259 controls. In multivariate analysis, central obesity, female gender, and younger age were significantly associated with NERD [odds ratio (OR)=2.55, 1.93, and 1.80; p=0.001, 0.005, and 0.011, respectively]. After adjusting for 12 clinical variables using propensity score matching, 114 NERD patients were matched to 114 controls. All variables were well balanced between the two groups (average D before matching: 0.248, after matching: 0.066). Patients with NERD were more likely to have central obesity than healthy controls (28.1% vs. 7.9%). After adjusting for propensity scores and all covariates in multivariable logistic regression analyses, central obesity was still found to be a significant risk factor for NERD (OR=4.55, p<0.001).
3:::129,708 prescriptions were retrieved from the database. The overall expenditure on opioids was R$4,316,383.46 BRL or $2,721,315.82 (PPP). The mean cost of an individual prescription was R$33.27 BRL ($20.98 PPP), ranging from 14.19 to 3,255.60 BRL. Codeine was frequently prescribed (87.2 percent).
3:::A significantly increased risk of lower serum SHBG level was observed in the group with hepatic steatosis and ALT elevation (95% CI 1.591-4.681).
3:::Female patients had higher proportions of ≥60-minute decision time and ≥120-minute arrival time compared to male patients (33.9% vs. 23.1%, 60.9% vs. 52.1%, respectively). However, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.093 and 0.214, respectively). Previous cardiovascular disease (CVD) was associated with increased decision time in men, whereas, in women, lower educational status caused a greater delay in decision time. Factors associated with hospital arrival time excluding delayed decision time were referral from another hospital, previous CVD, and percutaneous coronary intervention in men, and referral from another hospital in women.
3:::The expressions of miR-34a/34b/34c were significantly lower in TNBC patients than in HC (p<0.001, p=0.027, p<0.001, respectively). miR-34a was correlated with tumor grade (p=0.038), lymph node positive (p=0.027), distant metastasis (p=0.004), and surgery (p=0.023); miR-34b was correlated with lymph node positivity (p=0.027); and miR-34c was correlated with tumor grade (p=0.017) and distant metastasis (p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis displayed low expression of miR-34a as associated with worse overall survival (OS) (p=0.011), as well as miR-34c low expression (p=0.002). In addition, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was performed, and low expression of miR-34c (p=0.011) was found to be an independent risk factor for OS, as well as tumor grade (p=0.013), lymph node positive (p=0.050), and distant metastasis (p=0.021).
3:::There were 256 patients recruited in the study, with a male: female ratio of 3:1. The most commonly affected age group was 20-40 years (52.4%). Tinea corporis et cruris was the most common type observed (27.2%). Potassium hydroxide positivity was seen in 211 samples (79.6%) and culture positivity was found in 139 samples (52.4%). The most common species identified was Trichophyton mentagrophytes (75.9%). Sensitivity testing was done on fifty isolates of T. mentagrophytes. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of itraconazole, ketoconazole, terbinafine and voriconazole were comparable, while griseofulvin showed the highest minimum inhibitory concentration. Itraconazole was found to be the most effective drug, followed by ketoconazole, terbinafine and fluconazole. Griseofulvin was the least effective drug among the tested antifungals.
3:::Twenty-seven questionnaires where returned. National databases are established in northwest European countries. There are five international general databases. Most database collect data on patients who have undergone an attempt to CRS and HIPEC. Two registries collect data on all patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis regardless the treatment. Most registries are primarily used for tracking outcomes and complications. When correlating the number of cases of CRS and HIPEC that are performed to the catchment area of the various registry, a large variation in the number of performed procedures related to the overall population was noted, ranging from 1.3 to 57 patients/million year with an average of 15 patients/1 million year.
3:::Among 24 patients, 16 (66.6%) had a high NAFLD activity score (NAS), which is diagnostic of NASH. Higher serum triglyceride level was significantly correlated with a high NAS. Higher steatosis grades were significantly associated with low insulin sensitivity (p=0.023). In addition, severe lobular inflammation was associated with higher IR: HOMA-IR (p=0.014) and QUICKI (p=0.023). Severe fibrosis correlated with low insulin sensitivity and high IR indexes: ISI-FFA (p=0.049), HOMA-IR (p=0.028), and QUICKI (p=0.007).
3:::A total of 150 biopsies in 95 men were revised. In 13% of diagnostic or second-to-last biopsies and 20% of the last biopsies on active surveillance revision of Gleason score resulted in change of recommendation (ie, active treatment or active surveillance). Concordance with Gleason score on radical prostatectomy was however similar for both the revised and original Gleason on biopsy. Ki67 and ERG were not statistically significant predictors of Gleason ≥7 or ≥pT3 on radical prostatectomy.
3:::More than 62% of men reported at least 1 syndemic condition. Prevalence did not vary by U.S. region-however, a larger proportion of nonurban men and those with lower income and education levels were above the median number of syndemic conditions. In bivariate analyses, HIV transmission risk behavior was associated with each syndemic condition except for childhood sexual abuse, whereas in multivariate analyses, it was associated with polydrug use, sexual compulsivity, being Latino, and being single and was highest among those reporting 3 or more syndemic conditions.
3:::White-matter microstructure was altered in children with reading disability, who exhibited significantly reduced fractional anisotropy in the left arcuate fasciculus. Among typically reading children, lower fractional anisotropy of the left arcuate fasciculus was associated with superior pseudoword reading performance. Both the group differences and variation in reading scores among the children with reading disability were associated with radial diffusivity (but not axial diffusivity), whereas variation in reading scores among typically reading children was associated with axial diffusivity (but not radial diffusivity).
3::: Overall, 1233 polyps were removed using cold snare resection with an overall success rate of 99.4 %. All failures of cold snare resection occurred in the cecum (8/82, failure rate 9.8 %). In the remaining colon, the success rate was 100 %. Immediate post-polypectomy bleeding occurred in 0.49 % of all patients and was most frequently seen in polyps larger than 9 mm. The procedure time was significantly shorter using cold snare resection compared with hot snare resection (27.6 min vs. 35.7 min, P  < 0.01).
3:::Tissue microarrays were generated from 419 patients having surgery for gastric cancer. Increased tryptase expression was associated with better overall and recurrence-free survival (both P < 0·001). Tryptase expression was an independent favourable prognostic factor for overall (HR 0·72; P = 0·027) and recurrence-free (HR 0·74; P = 0·044) survival. The accuracy of an established prognostic model was improved when tryptase expression was added.
3:::Both cohorts were middle-aged adults of predominantly European descent. Among 11 candidate loci identified in discovery GWAS, one single nucleotide polymorphism near PR domain containing 2, with ZNF domain (PRDM2), rs7542939, had a combined P value of 6.5×10 in meta-analysis. Eighteen Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes pathways showed strong enrichment for variants associated with the primary outcome. Identified pathways related to DNA repair, cellular metabolism, and cardiac remodeling.
3:::Mean vessel count and area had increased in both matrices at 28 compared with 14 days. Collagen-elastin matrices showed a higher mean vessel count and area compared with collagen-glycosaminoglycan matrices at 14 days. At 28 days, a more homogeneous vascular network and higher cell counts were observed in collagen-elastin matrices. Collagen-glycosaminoglycan matrices, however, exhibited less volume loss at day 28.
3::: En-bloc resection and curative resection rates did not differ. Compared with the single group, each procedure time was faster (31.8 ± 23.6 min vs. 45.8 ± 44.8, P  = 0.002), but total procedure time was significantly longer in the simultaneous group (70.6 ± 33.4 vs. 45.8 ± 44.8 min, P  = 0.01). Rates of adverse events including bleeding and perforation were not higher in the simultaneous group but the mean blood pressure, incidence of bradycardia and the amount of sedative drug used during ESD were significantly higher in the simultaneous group. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified non-experienced physician, lesion size ≥ 40 mm and submucosal fibrosis as an independent risk factor for procedure duration (≥ 90 min) (Odds ratio 11.852, 18.280, and 3.672; P  < 0.05, respectively).
3:::The degree of methylation of L1 in HPV16, 18, and 52 was associated with the severity of the cervical lesion. In HPV52, C-phosphate-G (CpG) sites 6368m, 6405m, and 6443m showed significantly higher methylation in lesions ≥CIN3 (p=0.005, 0.003, and 0.026, respectively). Methylation of most HPV types except HPV52 (r<-0.1) was positively correlated with the degree of methylation of host genes including PAX1 and SOX1 (0.4≤r≤0.7). Combining HPV methylation with PAX1 methylation improved the clustering for ≥CIN2.
3:::Among the 767 institutions, 444 (57.9%) provided responses, including 91 (20.6%) that were both JSGOE and JSGO accredited, 71 (16.0%) that were only JSGO accredited, 88 (19.8%) that were only JSGOE accredited, and 194 (43.7%) that were unaccredited. It was found that awareness and performance of OBS largely depended on the JSGO and/or JSGOE accreditation status. OBS was only performed at 54.0% of responding institutions and just 6.8% of the institutions were willing to participate in randomized controlled trials to validate this method for reducing the incidence of ovarian cancer.
3:::Youths whose parents demonstrated greater spontaneous perspective-taking during the interview had cells that mounted smaller inflammatory responses to stimulation by nonspecific, asthma-specific, and viral analogue ligands, as well as cells that showed greater sensitivity to the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids. These results were not accounted for by parental warmth or parent or youth depressive symptoms, nor by covariates of race, age, gender, parental education level, use of asthma medications over the past week, or asthma severity.
3:::A total of 232 women with UCCC were identified. Of these, 53 (22.8%) had surgically-staged non-invasive UCCC. Twelve patients (22.6%) were upstaged at surgical assessment, including a 5.6% rate of lymphatic dissemination (3/53). Of those, 1 had stage IIIA, 1 had stage IIIC1, 1 had stage IIIC2, and 9 had stage IVB disease. Of the 9 women with stage IVB disease, 5 had isolated omental involvement indicating omentum as the most common metastatic site. UCCC limited only to the endometrium with no extra-uterine disease was confirmed in 41 women (73.3%) after surgical staging. Of those, 13 women (32%) were observed without adjuvant treatment whereas 28 patients (68%) underwent adjuvant therapy. The 5-year disease-free survival rates for patients with and without adjuvant treatment were 100.0% vs. 74.1%, respectively (p=0.060).
3:::The median TI was 4.5 weeks. There were no statistical differences in 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) (89.2% vs. 81.0%, and 83.2% vs. 100.0%) or 5-year overall survival (OS) rates (90.9% vs. 97.2%, and 93.2% vs. 100.0%) between patients according to TI (≤4 vs. >4, and ≤6 vs. >6 weeks, respectively). Deep stromal invasion (p=0.037), and parametrial involvement (PI) (p=0.002) were identified as independent prognostic factors for RFS, together with the interaction between TI and squamous cell carcinoma histology (p<0.001). In patients with squamous cell carcinoma, a TI longer than 4 weeks was significantly associated with a worse RFS (hazard ratio [HR]=15.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.4-173.9; p=0.024). Univariate analysis showed that only tumor size (p=0.023), and PI (p=0.003) were significantly associated with OS.
3:::Deleterious germline HR-mutations were identified in 36% of the ovarian cancer patients. Another 5 patients had only somatic mutations. BRCA2 was most frequently mutated. Three out of the 5 somatic mutations were in RAD genes and a wider distribution of other HR genes was involved in non-serous carcinomas. BRCA1/2-mutation carriers had favorable platinum sensitivity (relative risk, 1.57, p<0.05), resulting in a 100% remission probability and survival rate. In contrast, mutations in other HR genes predicted poor prognosis. However, multivariate analysis demonstrated that platinum sensitivity and optimal cytoreduction were the independent impact factors influencing survival (hazards ratio, 0.053) and relapse (hazards ratio, 0.247), respectively.
3:::The 27-G and 25-G groups did not differ significantly in underlying diseases and preoperative Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) score. The time required for vitrectomy was significantly longer in the 27-G group (35.3 vs. 29.8 min, P = 0.0013). Postoperative hypotony was observed in 0 and 3 patients, and ocular hypertension in 10 and 14 patients in the 27-G and 25-G groups, respectively, showing more stabilized postoperative ocular pressure in the 27-G group. Gain in ETDRS score was significantly better in the 27-G group (12.1 ± 20.2 letters) compared to the 25-G group (10.0 ± 21.3 letters) (P = 0.0323) at 1 month post-vitrectomy, but not significantly different at 3 and 6 months (P = 0.0686 and 0.0543). Rates of postoperative retinal detachment (1 vs. 1%) and vitreous hemorrhage (2 vs. 3%) were not different between two groups.
3:::Most patients presented with abnormal genital bleeding including abnormal menstrual cycles. Eight of 16 patients older than 50 years had endometrial hyperplasia and one had endometrial cancer. Serum 17β-estradiol (E₂) levels tended to be higher in patients over 50 years of age (p=0.081). Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were low in all patients irrespective of serum E₂ levels. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a thicker endometrium in older as compared to younger patients (p<0.05). Tumor cells in the majority of cases were positive for inhibin α and P450 aromatase, irrespective of age and serum E₂ levels. P450 17α-hydroxylase (P450c17) expression varied among cases. P450c17 was strongly positive in luteinized tumor cells and weakly positive in theca cells and fibroblasts. High E₂ levels were associated with P450c17-positive cells in the tumor (p<0.05).
3:::Implementing the solver completely on the graphics processing unit and combining it with an atlas-based ultrasound simulation approach yields a simulation performance faster than real time (less than 50-s computing time for 100 s of treatment time) on a modern off-the-shelf laptop. The simulation method is incorporated into a treatment planning demonstration application that allows to simulate real patient cases including respiratory motion.
3:::Children watched 78% of the cartoon (Tobii) compared with 67% (webcam scoring), although the 2 measures were highly correlated (r = .90, p = .001). It is possible for 2 such measures to be highly correlated even if one is consistently higher than the other (Bergemann et al., 2012). Both ECVT Tobii and webcam ECVT measures significantly correlated with COAT immediate recall (r = .37, p = .02 vs. r = .38, p = .01, respectively) and total recall (r = .33, p = .06 vs. r = .42, p = .005) measures. However, neither the Tobii eye tracking nor PROCODER webcam ECVT measures of attention correlated with MSEL composite cognitive performance or BRIEF-P global executive composite.
3:::Questionnaires were returned by 142 orthodontists (43.8%) and completed by 100 laypersons. The larger the size of the caries lesion in the maxillary second premolar was found, the more orthodontists and laypersons both chose to extract a carious maxillary second premolar instead of a healthy maxillary first premolar. For orthodontists, the use of mini-implant anchorage was significantly related to their extraction decision. Orthodontists who were familiar with mini-implants usage would choose to extract the second premolar at a lower size of extent of caries. Besides, when larger sizes of caries lesions in maxillary second premolars were considered, laypersons tended to have greater acceptance of the use of additional anchorage devices in order to keep the healthy maxillary first premolar.
3:::A total of 1,482 women were included in the analysis; 800 (54.0%) were diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma (LMS), 520 (35.1%) with low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LG-ESS), and 162 (10.9%) with adenosarcoma (AS). The OP group included 418 women (28.2%). Differences in the rate of OP were noted based on histology (p=0.014), year of diagnosis (p=0.001), patient age (p<0.001) and race (p=0.012). There was no difference in OS (p=0.220) or CSS (p=0.210) between women who had OP and those who did not. Multivariate analysis confirmed that OP was not associated with a worse mortality.
3:::Levels of Glx were significantly different between the groups (F(2,94)=5.27, p=0.007). Planned comparisons showed that higher Glx levels were found in control participants than in the total patient group (p=0.010). However, patients with lifetime AVH had higher levels of Glx compared to patients without lifetime AVH (p=0.019). Creatin levels were similar in all three groups. We found no association between Glx and the severity of symptoms (item P3 of the PANSS or PANSS positive subscale).
3:::For all participants (n = 12), procedure times (mean, 920 ± 279 seconds for the first session vs 454 ± 156 seconds for the fourth session; P < .01; confidence interval [CI], 315-621) and fluoroscopy cumulative times (mean, 421 ± 230 seconds for the first session vs 222 ± 102 seconds for the fourth session; P < .01; CI, 78-285) decreased with progression of cases. Students and PGY 1-3 residents decreased their procedure times significantly in comparison of initial and final sessions (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). For all groups, fluoroscopy cumulative times were reduced, and this decrement was significant in the PGY 1-3 cohort (mean, 444 ± 8 seconds for the first session vs 265 ± 51 seconds for the fourth session; P < .01; CI, 81-276). Initial CAS procedure times were significantly different between groups (P < .05), but this was observed to resolve by the final case at study completion. Qualitatively, the Likert scores of students and PGY 1-3 residents significantly improved with case repetition, specifically in the following steps: (1) cannulation of common carotid artery and (2) sizing and deployment of embolic protection device. Senior operators (PGY 4-7) demonstrated consistently better performance overall with minimal change in scoring with case repetition.
3:::A total of 160 patients were finally assessed. Seventy-eight patients belonged to study group and 82 in the control group. Baseline characteristics were similar and well matched in both groups. Mean age was 39.9 ± 15.8 years in the study group and 42.8 ± 12.8 in the control group and majority were female patients in both groups. At the end of 4 weeks, it was observed that the study group patients who received montelukast had better forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) improvement by 21% (0.21 L) as compared to the control group (P < 0.0033). It was also observed that there was a better improvement in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at 2 weeks (0.4 L/s, 12%) and at 4 weeks (0.9 L/s, 23%) as compared to the control group (P < 0.0376 and P < 0.0003 respectively). There was no difference in forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio and relapse rates between the two groups. No serious adverse effects were observed during the study.
3:::Four comparative cohort studies (n = 649 eyes) comparing the outcome of EK with repeat PK after failed PK were included in this review. These studies were considered high quality, with NOS scores ranging from 6 to 9. The EK group showed a significantly lower risk of graft rejection than the repeat PK group [0.43 (95% CI: 0.23-0.80, P = 0.007)]. In addition, no significant differences were observed in a comparison of graft survival and visual acuity (P values ranged from 0.81 to 0.97 using the Der-Simonian and Laird random-effects model).
3:::Over an average 8.2-year follow-up, 939 of 23 983 participants had a stroke. The FSRF and SRSRF produced highly correlated risk scores (rSpearman=0.852; 95% confidence interval, 0.849-0.856); however, the SRSRF had higher discrimination of stroke risk than the FSRF (cSRSRF=0.7266; 95% confidence interval, 0.7076-0.7457; cFSRF=0.7075; 95% confidence interval, 0.6877-0.7273; P=0.0038). The 10-year stroke risk in the highest decile of predicted risk was 11.1% for the FSRF and 13.4% for the SRSRF.
3:::In the pre-vaccine era, a total of approximately 107,600 (95% confidence interval [CI] 83,000-140,000) cases of severe hospitalised pneumococcal disease were estimated to have occurred annually. Following PCV introduction and the improvement in HIV interventions, 41,800 (95% CI 28,000-50,000) severe pneumococcal disease cases were estimated in 2012-2013, a rate reduction of 1,277 cases per 100,000 child-years. Approximately 5000 (95% CI 3000-6000) pneumococcal-related annual deaths were estimated in the pre-vaccine period and 1,900 (95% CI 1000-2500) in 2012-2013, a mortality rate difference of 61 per 100,000 child-years.
3:::The study group had a significant improvement in the microsurgical technique, assessed using the SAMS score, when the initial and final scores were compared (Mean: 24 SAMS initial versus 49 SAMS final) (p < 0.05, Wilcoxons rank test). The control group had a significantly lower rate of improvement (Mean: 23 SAMS initial versus 25 SAMS final). There was a significant difference between the final SAMS score of the study group and that of senior surgeons (Mean: 49 study final SAMS versus 58 senior SAMS).'
3:::In this cross sectional observational study, the serum concentration of FOXO3A and SIRT3 declined significantly (p<0.0001) with increasing age and even after adjustment with all geriatric co-morbidities the level remain downregulated with age. In the stress inducible cell line showed reduced level of proteins which gets upregulated by the treatment of Ashwagandha.
3:::The pattern of comorbidities appeared important in predicting clinical service, with Neurologists managing the epilepsy of relatively more of those with neurological comorbidities whilst CIDTs managed the epilepsy of relatively more of those with psychiatric comorbidities. Epilepsy-related outcomes, as measured by the Glasgow Epilepsy Outcome Scale 35 (GEOS-35) and the Epilepsy and Learning Disabilities Quality of Life Scale (ELDQoL) did not differ significantly between Neurology services and CIDTs.
3:::The results showed that the semi-supervised approaches significantly improved standard supervised techniques for both languages. Moreover, clustering the semantic spaces contributed to the quality of the entity recognition while keeping the dimension of the feature-space two orders of magnitude lower than when directly using the semantic spaces.
3:::The intervention and control neighborhoods included 177 and 116 children respectively. The average attendance per event was 60 children (SD = 22, reach 34%). In the intervention neighborhood, a significant increase between baseline and final assessment was observed in after-school outdoor playtime (p = 0.02), steps during the 3-hour intervention (p = 0.004), and daily steps Monday to Sunday (p = 0.006). Meanwhile, no changes were observed in the control neighborhood for the same variables. The proportion of children who met recommended daily step counts increased from 27.5% to 53.0% in the intervention neighborhood (p = 0.007), while for control neighborhood no difference was observed (49.0% to 53.0% p = 0.804).
3:::Test scenarios indicated a systematic and accurate shade selection system by suggesting a shade that resulted in a CIEDE2000 color difference of zero when using the same target and backing shades. Most scenarios of backing and target combinations gave at least one option that was beneath the acceptability threshold indicating a clinically acceptable shade match. Many test scenarios indicated options that were beneath the perceptibility threshold indicating a highly accurate process of shade selection. There was generally little variability in the CIEDE2000 color differences when using the reflectance data versus the RGB regression data as input into the shade selection program further verifying the accuracy of a previously generated regression model.
3:::A significant decrease in speed (p = 0.001) and stride length (p<0.001) was observed between the control and stroller conditions, however no significant change in energetic cost (p = 0.080) or heart rate (p = 0.393) was observed. Additionally, pushing method had a significant effect on speed (p = 0.001) and stride length (p<0.001).
3:::In all, 261 patients were included in the study. Patients with rAAA were initially misdiagnosed in 33% (n = 86) of the cases and this caused a 4.8 hour (median time) additional delay to surgical intervention. There were no differences in 30 day mortality between initially misdiagnosed patients and correctly diagnosed patients (27.9% vs. 28.0%; p = 1.00). The adjusted odds ratio for mortality in initially misdiagnosed patients compared with correctly diagnosed patients was 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.38-1.60). No difference was observed between the groups regarding 90 day mortality, length of intensive care, need for post-operative ventilator support, need of haemodialysis support, and length of hospital stay.
3:::Nationally, in comparison to males slightly younger than the MLDA, those just older had significant and immediate increases in sexual-assault perpetration of 31.9% (95% confidence interval: 8.7%-54.5%, p = .007). In MLDA-19 provinces, there was an immediate post-MLDA increase of 56.0% (95% confidence interval: 18.9%-90.8%, p = .004) in sexual-assault crimes by males just older than 19 years, whereas in MLDA-18 provinces no significant effect was found. For females, there was no evidence of MLDA effects on sexual-assault crimes.
3:::NACP composite had mechanical properties similar to commercial control composites (p>0.1). NACP composite neutralized acid and released Ca and P ions. PAMAM alone failed to induce dentin remineralization. NACP alone achieved mild remineralization and slightly increased dentin hardness at 21days (p>0.1). In contrast, the PAMAM+NACP nanocomposite method in acid solution without initial Ca and P ions greatly remineralized the pre-demineralized dentin, restoring its hardness to approach that of healthy dentin (p>0.1).
3:::We generated three recombinant viruses, HSV-GFP, HSV-GR (Green-Red), and HSV-Red. The HSV-GFP showed two log higher titer (1010 PFU) than wild type (108 PFU). In contrast, HSV-GR and HSV-Red showed one log lower titer (107 PFU) than parental HSV. Cytotoxicity analysis showed that HSV-GR and HSV-Red can lyse target tumor cells at multiplicity of infection of 10 and 1 (P<0.001). Moreover, HSV-GFP showed higher infection potency (98%) in comparison with HSV-GR (82%).
3:::15 studies were eligible for inclusion. Overall match and training injury incidence ranged from 3.3 to 218.0 injuries/1000 player match hours and 0.1-6.1 injuries/1000 player training hours, respectively. Muscle and tendon as well as joint (non-bone) and ligament injuries were the most frequently occurring injuries. The lower limb was the most prevalent injury location. Injury incidence was higher in professional rugby union players than non-professional players. Contact events were responsible for the greatest injury incidence. For non-contact mechanisms, running was responsible for the highest injury incidence. Inconsistent injury definitions hindered reliable comparison of injury data. The lack of reporting training volumes in hours per player per week limited the ability to investigate associations between training volume and injury incidence.
3:::Among 717 participants with incident ischemic stroke with survival data, slow walking speed, low grip strength, and cystatin C were independently associated with shorter survival. Among participants <80 years of age, frailty and interleukin-6 were also associated with shorter survival. Among 509 participants with recovery data, slow walking speed, and low grip strength were associated with both cognitive and activities of daily living decline poststroke. C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 were associated with poststroke cognitive decline among men only. Frailty status was associated with activities of daily living decline among women only.
3:::We included 656 patients, aged 18 to 99 years, of whom 53 had a history of migraine (29 with aura). Patients with migraine did not have more frequent atherosclerotic changes in intracranial (51% versus 74%; adjusted risk ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-1.05) or extracranial vessels (62% versus 79%; adjusted risk ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.12) than patients without migraine and had comparable internal carotid artery calcification volumes (largest versus medium and smallest volume tertile, 23% versus 35%; adjusted risk ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-1.52).
3:::In total, 37 participants received semaglutide and 38 received placebo. Following IVGTT, for insulin, both AUC0-10min and AUC10-120min were significantly increased with semaglutide (estimated treatment ratio [95% CI] 3.02 [2.53, 3.60] and 2.10 [1.86, 2.37], respectively; p < 0.0001). The 24 h meal test showed reduced fasting, postprandial and overall (AUC0-24h) glucose and glucagon responses with semaglutide (p < 0.0001). The AST showed that maximal insulin capacity increased following semaglutide treatment. During GGIT, semaglutide significantly increased ISR to levels similar to those in healthy participants. Semaglutide was well tolerated.
3:::A total of 78.1% of the pregnant women and 53.9% of the non-pregnant women had a vitamin D status <50.0 nmol/L (p < 0.001). In pregnant women, the multivariate binary analysis showed that winter [odds ratio (OR) 13.5], longitude of residence between 6.3°E and 8.9°E (OR 2.0) or 9.0°E and 10.9°E (OR 2.3) and third trimester (OR 2.3) were associated with a higher risk of vitamin D status <25.0 nmol/L, whereas increasing age per one year (OR 0.9) with a lower risk. Compared with non-pregnant women, pregnant women were 3.7 times more likely to have a vitamin D status <25.0 nmol/L.
3:::We found fifteen studies, including seven cohort, six cross-sectional, one case control and one randomized control trial. Coffee consumption was generally associated with a reduction in prevalence of asthma. The association of coffee with natural honey was an effective treatment for persistent post-infectious cough. One case-control study found higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with coffee consumption. No association was found with the evolution of COPD or sarcoidosis. Coffee was associated with a reduction in respiratory mortality, and one study found improved lung function in coffee consumers. Smoking was a significant confounder in most studies.
3:::This study enrolled 62 cases of anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients, including 29 males (46.8%) and 33 females (53.2%). The patient ages were between 10 and 59 (mean 26.3±11.3) years. A total of 93 instances of EEG monitoring were performed on 62 patients. At the peak stage, EEG presentations showed 61 cases (98.4%) were abnormal, cranial MRI showed 29 cases (46.8%) were abnormal among all 62 patients. The main presentations of abnormal EEG were diffuse slowing (25 cases, 40.3%), epileptiform discharges (11 cases, 17.7%), extreme delta brush (EDB) (10 cases, 16.1%), polymorphic delta rhythm (6 cases, 9.7%), focal slowing (5 cases, 8.1%), and diffuse beta activities (4 cases, 6.5%). Patients with normal background, epileptiform discharges, polymorphic delta rhythm, and diffuse beta activity in EEG all had favorable long-term outcome.
3:::The prevalence rates of being underweight and overweight, based on W/A z scores of ≤-2 and ≥2, were 8.2% and 5.7%, respectively. Patients who were underweight were younger and had a higher rate of mortality, poor outcomes, and longer duration of mechanical ventilation than those with a normal weight. The patients with mortality or major sequelae had significantly higher rates of being underweight, noninfectious diseases and hypotension, and higher Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 (PIM2) score and creatinine level (all P < .01). In multivariate logistic regression interpretation, the W/A z score ≤-2 (95% CI, 2.992-47.508; P < .001) and PIM2 score (95% CI, 1.094-1.413; P = .001) were independent risk factors for a poor outcome.
3:::Pre-video knowledge about why people smoke cigarettes and what genetic risk means informed beliefs about the relationship between genes and addiction. These beliefs were not always consistent with biomedical explanations, but formed the context through which participants processed the videos information. This, in turn, led to information acceptance or skepticism. Participants explained their reactions in terms of the scientific merits of the research and used their existing knowledge and beliefs to explain their acceptance of or skepticism about the information.'
3:::Only lutein + zeaxanthin were inversely correlated with IL-6 in SA patients at baseline (r = -0.366, p < 0.001) and follow-up (r = -0.546, p < 0.001). Ex vivo, lutein was taken up by PBMCs from SA patients in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Pre-treatment with lutein dose-dependently lowered LPS-induced secretion of IL-6, IL-1β (p < 0.01) and TNF (p < 0.05), and also reduced IL-6, IL-1β and TNF mRNA expression (p < 0.05).
3:::Significant associations were found between poor seizure control and prolonged ≥3s epileptiform runs, p=0.03 (8/19 vs 2/21), long ≥3s photoparoxysmal runs, p=0.04 (6/19 vs 1/21) and long ≥3s hyperventilation-induced epileptiform runs, p=0.02 (5/19 vs 0/21). The strongest association between persistent seizures and EEG was found when all epileptiform runs ≥3s were combined (p=0.007), with a positive predictive value equal to 79% and a negative predictive value equal to 69%. Fast (4-5c/s) spike-wave runs were also more frequent in patients with persistent seizures compared to the remission group, p=0.04 (9/19 vs 3/21). Other epileptiform elements occurred equally in the two prognostic groups. Psychosocial outcome was not influenced by EEG findings. Prolonged runs within 6 months from first recording did also predict clinical outcome, p=0.03; (8/19 vs 2/21), with a positive predictive value equal to 80% and a negative predictive value equal to 63%.
3:::Two patients were found: the first case presents a newly diagnosed metastatic melanoma at 26-weeks of gestation with fatal maternal and neonatal outcome. The second case presents a patient with metastatic melanoma who got pregnant during her treatment. For the systematic review we found 25 articles, providing data from 489 patients. Maternal-perinatal outcomes, including termination of pregnancy rates, vary depending on the country, gestational age and tumour stage at diagnosis. PAM is usually detected at advanced stages, even with metastasis affecting the placenta and the foetus.
3:::SUVmax showed a negative correlation with ADC (r = -0.404, p = 0.009). The median of SUVmax was 3.22 in HCC, 6.99 in CCC, 6.30 in metastatic tumors, and 1.82 in benign lesions. The median of ADC was 1.039 × 10-3 mm/s2 in HCC, 1.148 × 10-3 mm/s2 in CCC, 0.876 × 10-3 mm/s2 in metastatic tumors, and 1.323 × 10-3 mm/s2 in benign lesions. SUVmax was higher in metastatic tumors than in benign lesions (p = 0.023). Metastatic tumors had a lower ADC than CCC (p = 0.039) and benign lesions (p = 0.004). HCC had a lower ADC than benign lesions, with a suggestive trend (p = 0.06).
3:::Women reported supplementing breast milk with water and teas soon after birth, as well as introducing small bites of solid food a few months after birth. Social norms appeared to support breastfeeding, but not exclusive breastfeeding or breastfeeding for periods longer than about a year. This may be partially explained by: a) behavioral beliefs that for the first 6 months breast milk alone is insufficient for the baby, and that water in addition to breast milk is necessary to hydrate an infant and b) normative beliefs related to the appropriateness of breastfeeding in public and as the child gets older.
3:::The SUA levels were significantly different between the normal BMD, osteopenia, and osteoporosis groups. The lumbar BMD was positively correlated with SUA in postmenopausal women after adjustment for age (r = 0.212). After adjustment for age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, hip circumference, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, milk intake, physical exercise, fracture history, total protein, total bilirubin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, serum calcium, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, the lumbar BMD was associated with SUA and the odds ratio of the third SUA quartile was 0.408 (95%CI, 0.198-0.841, P = 0.015), compared to the first quartile of SUA levels.
3:::Parents of children with CDH, who had been supported by ECMO or had a long hospital stay, showed significantly higher overall parental stress. Mothers scored an overall higher parental stress compared with fathers. A prenatal diagnosis of CDH or lower parental educational level resulted in significantly higher parental stress in some of the factors.
3:::447 participants were assessed with the ENLIST ENL Severity Scale. The Cronbach alpha of the scale and each item was calculated to determine the internal consistency of the scale. The ENLIST ENL Severity Scale had good internal consistency and this improved following removal of six items to give a Cronbachs alpha of 0.77. The cut off between mild ENL and more severe disease was 9 determined using ROC curves. The minimal important difference of the scale was determined to be 5 using both participant and physician ratings of change.'
3:::In this study, none of the tested variables, including regulation and activation products, proved to be significantly different between the groups. Moreover, no associations with either CSC disease activity or possible CSC related steroid use were observed.
3:::The Steering Committee identified the following four key principles for the ideal treatment regimen for anti-VEGF management of retinal diseases: 1. Maximize and maintain visual acuity (VA) benefits for all patients 2. Decide when to treat next, rather than whether to treat now 3. Titrate the treatment intervals to match patients needs 4. Treat at each monitoring visit.'
3:::HA enriched zirconia scaffolds revealed significantly higher volume of new bone formation (33% ± 14) compared to the controls (21% ± 11). New bone deposition started by coating the pore cavity walls and proceeded by filling the entire pore volume. Bone in-growth started from the surface of the scaffold and propagated towards the scaffold core. Islands of entrapped hydroxy apatite particles were observed in mineralized bone matrix.
3:::We performed 402 observations on 240 patients. Respiratory distress was absent in 78, mild in 157, moderate in 107, and severe in 60. Respiratory rate, hypoxia, heart rate, and frequency of most signs increased as distress increased. Respiratory rate and hypoxia explained 43% of the variance in respiratory distress. Diaphoresis, gasping, and contraction of the sternomastoid explained an additional 28%. Heart rate, blood pressure, alertness, agitation, body posture, nasal flaring, audible breathing, cyanosis, tracheal tug, retractions, paradox, scalene or abdominal muscles contraction did not increase the explained variance in respiratory distress.
3:::The task was successful in inducing emotional arousal and participants were successful in their efforts to down regulate negative emotions. Additionally, effective regulation strategies were used more frequently than maladaptive strategies.
3:::Skin Gb3 deposits were found in all FD patients with classical GLA mutations but never in FD patients with late-onset variants or GLA polymorphisms or in patients with SFN and healthy controls. Abnormal deposits were found inside different skin structures but never inside axons. FD patients with GB3 deposits showed lower skin innervation than FD patients with late-onset variants or polymorphisms.
3:::A total of 12 patients were included for analysis, five of which experienced HIT related thrombosis prior to initiation of DOAC therapy. Seven patients received parenteral therapy with argatroban prior to initiation of DOAC treatment. Nine patients were treated with apixaban while three received rivaroxaban for an average of 9.33 days while hospitalized. Zero patients experienced the primary outcome of HIT related thrombosis and no patients experienced major bleeding post DOAC initiation. All patients achieved platelet recovery while receiving DOAC therapy.
3:::FLG mutation carriers had 80% (13-180%) higher urinary concentrations of methyl paraben (MeP) and 91% (13-219%) higher concentrations of n-propyl paraben (n-PrP) than controls. For 13 compounds, levels were higher in FLG mutation carriers, although differences were only statistically significant for MeP and n-PrP. Combined statistical analysis of concentrations of all the 18 compounds that were detectable in >10% of subjects, suggested that concentrations were generally higher in mutation carriers (p=0.03).
3:::Of the 1 429 652 births included in the sample, 5373 births were in 3586 women with epilepsy; mean (SD) age at first delivery of the epilepsy cohort was 30.54 (5.18) years. Compared with pregnancies of women without epilepsy, women with epilepsy were at increased risks of adverse pregnancy and delivery outcomes, including preeclampsia (aRR 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.43), infection (aRR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.43-2.29), placental abruption (aRR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.18-2.38), induction (aRR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21-1.40), elective cesarean section (aRR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.45-1.71), and emergency cesarean section (aRR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00-1.20). Infants of mothers with epilepsy were at increased risks of stillbirth (aRR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.05-2.30), having both medically indicated (aRR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.43) and spontaneous (aRR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.20-1.53) preterm birth, being small for gestational age at birth (aRR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13-1.30), and having neonatal infections (aRR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.17-1.73), any congenital malformation (aRR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.35-1.62), major malformations (aRR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.43-1.81), asphyxia-related complications (aRR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.26-2.42), Apgar score of 4 to 6 at 5 minutes (aRR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03-1.76), Apgar score of 0 to 3 at 5 minutes (aRR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.62-3.61), neonatal hypoglycemia (aRR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.34-1.75), and respiratory distress syndrome (aRR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.30-1.68) compared with infants of unaffected women. In women with epilepsy, using AEDs during pregnancy did not increase the risks of pregnancy and perinatal complications, except for a higher rate of induction of labor (aRR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.10-1.55).
3:::Of the 501 patients randomized (mean age, 45.9 years; 53.7% men), 395 (78.8%) completed the trial. During the maintenance period, the rates of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia were 2200.9 episodes per 100 person-years exposure (PYE) in the insulin degludec group vs 2462.7 episodes per 100 PYE in the insulin glargine U100 group for a rate ratio (RR) of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85-0.94; P < .001 for noninferiority; P < .001 for superiority; rate difference, -130.31 episodes per 100 PYE; 95% CI, -193.5 to -67.16). The rates of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia were 277.1 per 100 PYE in the insulin degludec group vs 428.6 episodes per 100 PYE in the insulin glargine U100 group, for an RR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.56-0.73; P < .001 for noninferiority; P < .001 for superiority; rate difference, -61.94 episodes per 100 PYE; 95% CI, -83.85 to -40.03). A lower proportion of patients in the insulin degludec than in the insulin glargine U100 group experienced severe hypoglycemia during the maintenance period (10.3%, 95% CI, 7.3%-13.3% vs 17.1%, 95% CI, 13.4%-20.8%, respectively; McNemar P = .002; risk difference, -6.8%; 95% CI, -10.8% to -2.7%).'
3:::A total of 516 CPhTs currently working as a pharmacy technician responded to the survey. The CPhTs reported high levels of involvement in more traditional activities but less involvement in those that involve greater cognitive load. Respondents reported moderate levels of job satisfaction and commitment and somewhat high levels of stress overall. Most CPhTs chose to be a pharmacy technician because they desired to enter a healthcare field and help people and were recruited. CPhTs derived benefit from all aspects of education and training evaluated and most from on-the-job training. Perceived value of education and training was associated with higher satisfaction and commitment and with lower stress. There were a number of differences in these work life attitudes across practice settings and by involvement in various job functions.
3:::After recalibration, 14 of 15 assays met the bias specification with 95% confidence; 8 assays complied with the TE specification. The CV of the assay means for the harmonization panel was reduced from 9.5% to 4.2%. The RI study showed improved uniformity after recalibration: the ranges (i.e., maximum differences) exhibited by the assay-specific 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th percentile estimates were reduced from 0.27, 0.89, and 2.13 mIU/L to 0.12, 0.29, and 0.77 mIU/L.
3:::The trial was stopped for safety and futility in November 2013 after 364 of the planned 726 infants were enrolled. Among 347 infants (95%) with primary outcome data (mean age at follow-up, 20.7 [SD, 3.5] months; 42% female), death or disability occurred in 56 of 176 (31.8%) cooled for 72 hours and 54 of 171 (31.6%) cooled for 120 hours (adjusted risk ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.68-1.25]; adjusted absolute risk difference, -1.0% [95% CI, -10.2% to 8.1%]) and in 59 of 185 (31.9%) cooled to 33.5°C and 51 of 162 (31.5%) cooled to 32.0°C (adjusted risk ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.68-1.26]; adjusted absolute risk difference, -3.1% [95% CI, -12.3% to 6.1%]). A significant interaction between longer and deeper cooling was observed (P = .048), with primary outcome rates of 29.3% at 33.5°C for 72 hours, 34.5% at 32.0°C for 72 hours, 34.4% at 33.5°C for 120 hours, and 28.2% at 32.0°C for 120 hours.
3:::Since closing the eyes generally increases alpha power, one might have expected a decrease in excitability (higher PT). While we confirmed a rise in alpha power with eyes closed, visual excitability was actually increased (PT was lower) with eyes closed.
3:::From 1.08 billion prescription claims, a cohort of 1120 generic drugs was identified. After adjustment, drugs with quadropoly (HHI value of 2500, indicating relatively high levels of competition), duopoly (HHI value of 5000), near-monopoly (HHI value of 8000), and monopoly (HHI value of 10 000) levels of baseline competition were associated with price changes of -31.7% (95% CI, -34.4% to -28.9%), -11.8% (CI, -18.6% to -4.4%), 20.1% (CI, 5.5% to 36.6%), and 47.4% (CI, 25.4% to 73.2%), respectively, over the study period.
3:::A total of 1784 survey responses were completed of the 1888 text messages received by patients, yielding 487 menstrual patterns in 128 patients (mean [SD] age, 16.2 [2.0] years). Of the 68 patients who had a concussion, 16 (23.5%) experienced 2 or more abnormal menstrual patterns during the study period compared with 3 of 60 patients (5%) who had an orthopedic injury. Despite similar gynecologic age, body mass index, and type of sports participation between groups, the risk of 2 or more abnormal menstrual bleeding patterns after injury was significantly higher among patients with concussion than among those with an orthopedic injury (odds ratio, 5.85; 95% CI, 1.61-21.22).
3:::M. abscessus and M. massiliense each caused 10 (50%) of the cases. Eight (80%) M. abscessus isolates that had inducible resistance to clarithromycin harbored an intact erm(41) gene of the T28 variant, whereas two (20%) M. abscessus isolates had the C28 erm(41) variant and were susceptible to clarithromycin. All M. massiliense isolates had a truncated erm(41) gene and were susceptible to clarithromycin. The drug susceptibility profiles other than clarithromycin were similar for the M. abscessus and M. massiliense isolates. Of the 20 patients, 17 (85%) showed a favorable outcome, including all patients with M. massiliense infection and 70% (7/10) of patients with M. abscessus infection. Favorable outcomes were associated with M. massiliense and M. abscessus isolates with a non-functional erm(41) gene (p=0.049).
3:::Electrical stimulation of afferent inputs to the trigeminal nerve increased fluorescent intensity in the Vc, which was completely diminished by tetrodotoxin and significantly suppressed by the AMPA/kainate antagonist CNQX (paired t-test, P<0.001), although the non-competitive NMDA antagonist (+)-MK801 maleate resulted in no changes. These results suggested a glutamate receptor-mediated response.
3:::In total, 245 cases were identified: 24 from our present series and 221 from the literature. The distribution by gender was 54.6% male and 45.4% female, and the mean age was 23.1 years. Only 7 patients had known multiple lesions. Treatment modalities varied greatly. Of those with follow-up information, only 9 were cases with recurrences.
3:::In quiet, sentence recognition by the 11-year-old children was similar to that of adults, and misrepresented lexical tone contours did not have a detrimental effect. However, the performance of children ages 9 and 7 years was significantly poorer. The performance of all three age groups, especially the younger children, declined significantly in noise.
3:::Affected teeth were first permanent molars with hypoplastic roots, narrow pulp chambers, and a hypercalcified dentine layer cervical to the pulp chamber. Two of the cases also had cervical constrictions on the upper incisors. The patients were 8 to 12 years of age and healthy, but had experienced serious medical conditions of the head and neck region in their first year of life. Some of the cases had been referred because of acute infection and pain.
3:::Cypriots valued choosing alternative SDM services compared to their current' option, whereas the English preferred their status quo to other services. Having the primary-care-physician as healthcare provider, receiving compassionate care, receiving detailed and accurate information about their care, continuity of care, choosing their care management and treatment, and reduced waiting time were the SDM characteristics that Cypriots valued; the English preferred similar factors, apart from information/continuity of care.'
3:::Three hundred and twenty-four patients were analyzed, 17% required massive transfusion. Massive transfusion patients had a median shock index of 1.2, assessment of blood consumption score of 1, and trauma-associated severe hemorrhage score of 12. Rapid TEG and tPA TEG parameters were significantly different in all massive transfusion patients compared with non-massive transfusion patients (all p < 0.02). The low-dose tPA lysis at 30 minutes had the largest the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.86; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.93) for prediction of massive transfusion, similar to international normalized ratio of prothrombin time of 0.86 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.91), followed by trauma-associated severe hemorrhage score (0.83; 95% CI 0.77 to 0.89). Combing trauma-associated severe hemorrhage and tPA-TEG variables results in a positive prediction of massive transfusion in 49% of patients with a 98% negative predictive value.
3:::The SVL correction resulted in insufficient accommodative response for the near object viewing distances tested. PAL 2 did significantly reduce accommodative lag for all near object distances tested. The PAL design with a more negative horizontal mean power gradient (PAL 4) provided a lower lag of accommodation when compared with PAL 2 at the shortest object distance of 25 cm (P = 0.03) and was able to reduce the lag of accommodation to a level below the depth of focus for the higher near working distances tested.
3:::For the primary outcome variable (percentage of consonants correct), the significant mean change from pre- to postintervention for the intervention group (mean change = +6.15, p < .001) was comparable in magnitude to the significant change for the control group (mean change = +5.43, p < .001) with a small between-groups effect size for change (Cohens d = 0.08). Similar results occurred for measures of emergent literacy, phonological processing, participation, and well-being.'
3:::This study included 198 patients (266 MRI exams). MRI detected 15 cancers: 11 invasive stage I and 4 in-situ. All but 1 were mammographically occult and there were no interval cancers. The cancer detection rate (CDR) and false positive (FP) rate were 6.1% and 21% for round one and 4.7% and 12.5% for round two, respectively. Not being on anti-estrogen therapy and having a 1st degree relative with BC significantly increased the likelihood of tumor detection.
3:::TFA (b = -3.3 percentage points (pp), P = 0.009), SAT (b = -3.0 pp, P = 0.006), levels of adiponectin (b = -0.4 mg/L, P = 0.045), leptin (b = -4.3 µg/mL, P < 0.001), leptin:adiponectin ratio (b = -0.53, P = 0.001) and HDL cholesterol (b = -0.11 mmol/L, P = 0.009) decreased during TRT compared with placebo. Hepatic fat content and VAT were unchanged.
3:::The cumulative LBR per cycle was 14.7% (n = 34) and that per patient was 31.7% (n = 32). The cumulative LBR was significantly decreased by active smoking [adjOR = 3.4, 95% CI (1.12-10.60), p = 0.031], poor ovarian response (POR) according to the Bologna criteria [adjOR = 11.5, 95% CI (1.37-96.83), p = 0.024], and rAFS stage IV [adjOR = 3.2, 95% CI (1.13-8.95), p = 0.024]. The cumulative LBR per women was 59.4% without factors associated with a poor prognosis and 25.6% in the case of one factor, and it decreased to 7.7% in the case of two or three factors (p < 0.001).
3:::Neuropsychiatric profiles were similar in adults with current or recent alcohol dependence regardless of sex. In male and female participants measures of depression (female p<0.05, male p<0.001), anxiety (female p<0.001, male p<0.001), and memory complaints (female p<0.001, male p<0.05) were elevated, relative to non-dependent controls. Significant sex×alcohol dependence history interactions were observed for plasma levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), with women in the alcohol dependent group exhibiting increased levels of both analytes (p<0.05) relative to controls. Positive correlations between TIMP-1 levels and measures of depression (r(2)=0.35, p<0.01), anxiety (r(2)=0.24, p<0.05) and memory complaints (r(2)=0.44, p<0.01) were found in female, but not male, participants.
3:::The association between HBA1C and depressive symptoms was mediated by diabetes-related distress,, while there was no definite evidence of depression influencing HBA1C through changes of adherence, tiredness, appetite, alcohol intake or smoking. Among individuals with AT, distress was unrelated to HBA1C and had a higher impact on depression; adherence was inversely association with HBA1C. Moreover, physical comorbidities impacted on depression. While diabetes type had a moderation role, age and gender did not affect the model.
3:::Forty-one HF patients with pleural effusion were included, and twenty-eight patients (68%) survived. The multivariate logistic stepwise analysis revealed that the gestational birth week (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96, p = 0.027) and standard deviation (SD) score of the birth weight (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.01-2.99, p = 0.045) were significant factors for postnatal death. All patients with both >32 gestational weeks and <3.0 birth weight SD score survived.
3:::In the CaCl2-induced model, treatment with rTMD1 suppressed the tissue levels of HMGB1 and RAGE, macrophage accumulation, elastin destruction and AAA formation, and the effects were comparable to a mole-equivalent dosage of rTMD123. In the angiotensin II-infused model, a single intravenous injection of rAAV-TMD1 (10(11) genome copies), which resulted in a persistently high serum level of TMD1 for at least 12 weeks, effectively attenuated AAA formation with suppression of HMGB1 and RAGE levels and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production, macrophage accumulation, matrix metalloproteinase activities and oxidative stress in the aortic wall.
3:::The percentage of abstinent patients during 20 consecutive weeks (primary endpoint) was low (baclofen: 11.9%; placebo: 10.5%) and not significantly different between groups (OR 1.20; 95%CI: 0.58 to 2.50; P = 0.618). A reduction in alcohol consumption was observed from month 1 in both groups, but the difference of 10.9 g/day at month 6 between groups, in favour of baclofen, was not statistically significant (P = 0.095). In a subgroup of patients with high drinking risk level at baseline, the reduction was greater with a difference at month 6 of 15.6 g/day between groups in favour of baclofen (P = 0.089). The craving assessed with Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale significantly decreased in the baclofen group (P = 0.017). No major safety concern was observed.
3:::The analysis included 271 patients (145 pre-intervention and 126 post-intervention). The average wait time in the pre-intervention group was 6.5 ± 2.1 (mean ± SD) minutes compared to 16.2 ± 3.2 min (P < 0.001) post intervention, and clinic times increased from 83.0 ± 29.6 min to 91.7 ±22.5 min (P < 0.007) from the pre- to post-intervention group, respectively. In adjusted regression analysis, there was no significant change in FEV1 % predicted between the two groups.
3:::The tobacco users (smokers and snuffers) had an earlier alcohol debut compared to the tobacco never-users. Snuffers reported regular alcohol consumption and inebriation at an earlier age in contrast to smokers and tobacco never-users. There were no difference between the groups regarding treatment outcome.
3:::From 2001 to 2012, the annual incidence of CDI and mrCDI per 1000 person-years increased by 42.7% (from 0.4408 to 0.6289 case) and 188.8% (from 0.0107 to 0.0309 case), respectively. The increase in mrCDI incidence was independent of known risk factors for CDI. Those who developed mrCDI were older (median age, 56.0 vs. 49.0 years; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] per 10-year increase in age, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.21 to 1.29]) and were more likely to be female (63.8% vs. 58.7%; aOR, 1.24 [CI, 1.11 to 1.38]) and to have used antibiotics (72.3% vs. 58.8%; aOR, 1.79 [CI, 1.59 to 2.01]), proton-pump inhibitors (24.6% vs. 18.2%; aOR, 1.14 [CI, 1.01 to 1.29]), or corticosteroids (18.3% vs. 13.7%; aOR, 1.15 [CI, 1.00 to 1.32]) within 90 days of CDI diagnosis. Chronic kidney disease (10.4% vs. 5.6%; aOR, 1.49 [CI, 1.24 to 1.80]) and diagnosis in a nursing home (2.1% vs. 0.6%; aOR, 1.99 [CI, 1.34 to 2.93]) were also associated with increased risk for mrCDI.
3:::In all ten corneoscleral rims the technique successfully created a visible pre-Descemetic (Type 1) bubble that could be expanded up to the predicted diameter of trephination. Subsequent trephination and the removal of corneal stroma were uneventful. In two out of four clinical cases, a type 1 bubble was created, while in two others, visco-dissection failed, and dyed viscoelastic was seen in the AC.
3:::The initial mean Gleason score was 6.3 ± 1.53 (range, 4-9). The mean prostate-specific antigen levels at the time of relapse were 1.9 ± 2.87 ng/mL (range, 0.24-13.2 ng/mL). MRI findings were positive for primary tumor recurrence in the prostate bed in 6 patients (6/20 [30.0%]), pelvic lymph node metastases in 4 patients (4/20 [20.0%]), and for pelvic skeletal metastases in 2 patients (2/20 [10.0%]), respectively. On the other hand, FCH PET/CT results were positive in the corresponding sites in 7 (7/20 [35.0%]), 9 (9/20 [45.0%]), and 2 patients (2/20 [10.0%]), respectively. F-fluorocholine PET/CT and MRI showed comparable results in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for PC characterization. The whole-body FCH PET/CT was found to be useful in identifying unknown distant metastases in a significant proportion of patients.
3:::CH, CD/Et and CEA displayed antileishmanial activity with 50% inhibitory activity (IC50) of 25.91 ± 4.87, 54.23 ± 3.78 and 62.74 ± 5.04 μg/mL, respectively. Parasites treated with CD/Et (131.2 μg/mL) presented severe alterations including mitochondrial swelling, lipid body formation and intense cytoplasmic vacuolization. CH and CD/Et demonstrated cytotoxic effects similar to that of amphotericin B in the anti-amastigote assays (SI of 2.16, 1.98 and 1.35, respectively). Triterpene amyrins were the main substances in CH and CD/Et extracts. In addition, 80 μg/mL of CD/Et reduced the number of intracellular amastigotes and the percentage of infected macrophages in 63% and 36%, respectively.
3:::Trinervinol and piquerol showed antigiardial activity with an IC50 = 2.03 and 2.42 μg/mL, and IC90 = 13.03 and 8.74 μg/mL, respectively. The concentrations of trinervinol (CC50 = 590 μg/mL) and piquerol (CC50 = 501 μg/mL) were not cytotoxic to human fibroblasts.
3:::Children with OSA had significantly higher levels of BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, and total BCAAs) compared with those without OSA (P = 0.024). A positive significant correlation was observed between insulin levels and both leucine and isoleucine (r = 0.232; P < 0.05). On multivariate regression analyses, the presence of OSA was significantly associated with leucine, isoleucine, and total BCAA concentrations (P = 0.028), whereas the arousal index was associated with leucine, valine, and total BCAA levels (P = 0.037).
3:::Based on the detection limit of the assay, 167 (26.0%) patients had detectable CK19mRNA(+) CTCs at baseline. The detection of CK19mRNA(+) CTCs before treatment was not associated with the clinical outcome, but their detection at the end of chemotherapy was associated with significantly decreased PFS and OS [PFS: 2.6 vs 3.8 months (p = 0.008); OS: 5.7 vs 10.0 months (p = 0.006) for CK19mRNA(+) vs CK19mRNA(-) patients, respectively]. Multivariate analysis revealed that the detection of CK19mRNA(+) CTCs both before and after chemotherapy emerged as an independent factor associated with reduced PFS (HR: 1.778; p < 0.001) and OS (HR: 1.608; p = 0.001).
3:::The study (n = 24) and control (n = 25) groups were comparable in birth characteristics (gestational age: 36.8 ± 1.9 vs 36.4 ± 1.8 weeks) and clinical condition at the time of recruitment (vital signs, clinical score, ventilation support, and blood gases). There was no difference between the study and control groups in clinical score (based on grunting, retractions, ala nasi, and respiratory rate) at recruitment and at 12, 24, and 48 h after the first inhalation (4.3 ± 1.6 vs 4.1 ± 2.1; 1.9 ± 1.8 vs 1.5 ± 1.7; 1.1 ± 1.4 vs 1.3 ± 1.6; 0.5 ± 0.8 vs 0.6 ± 1.0; respectively). Respiratory support at each time point, time to spontaneous unsupported breathing (67.4 ± 74.1 vs 75.2 ± 95.2 h), time to full feeds (86.7 ± 68.7 vs 84.3 ± 66.6 h) and length of stay (9.9 ± 5.5 vs 12.4 ± 8.0 days) did not differ between the groups. We did not detect any side effects.
3:::No change in all measured parameters was detected after sublingual topical application of ACH. Sublingual topical application of NG however led to an increase in TVD, space-time diagram-derived venular flow velocity and APSI. No difference was detected in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output as measured by echocardiography, as well as in plasma nitric oxide metabolite content before and after the topical application of ACH and NG.
3:::According to the binary grading system of WHO, 69 (49.28%) cases were LRED, while 71 (50.71%) case showed HRED. There was significant increase in Ki67 labeling index (LI) from NOM to LRED to HRED (p=0.000). Similarly, mean vascular density (MVD) also increased significantly from NOM to LRED to HRED (p=0.000). The α-SMA expression was significantly higher in HERD compared to LRED and NOM (p=0.000). A positive correlation was noted amongst Ki67 LI, MVD and α-SMA expression in NOM, LRED and HRE (p=0.000).
3:::The percentage of participants reporting recent (past six months) drug-driving decreased significantly over time among both samples (PWID: 83% [2007] vs. 74% [2013], p<0.001; RPU: 72% vs. 56%, p<0.001), but drug-driving remained prevalent. Lifetime experience of RDT increased significantly over time (PWID: 6% [2007] vs. 32% [2013], p<0.001; RPU: 2% vs. 11%, p<0.001). There were no significant associations between experiencing RDT and drug-driving among either PWID or RPU.
3:::Lofexidine significantly decreased mean Day 3 SOWS scores compared to placebo, 6.32 versus 8.67, respectively, p=0.0212. Fewer lofexidine patients were early terminators compared to placebo (59 versus 80, respectively); and non-completers in the lofexidine group remained in the study longer than those assigned to placebo (p=0.0034). Secondary endpoints consistently favored lofexidine. Lofexidine was well tolerated in this trial.
3:::When corrected for similar DE intake, dTT was significantly higher in DD compared to CD (p < 0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between creatinine clearance and dTT (r = -0.91, p < 0.01) among DD. Additionally, dTT positively correlated with CHOL (r = 0.96, p < 0.01), LDL (r = 0.75, p = 0.04), and GLU (r = 0.83, p = 0.02). In multiple regression analysis, creatinine clearance (r = -0.81, p = 0.01), CHOL (r = 0.93, p < 0.001), and LDL (r = 0.74, p < 0.01) remained the only independent predictors of dTT.
3:::492 participants donated 315 valid joints. Donators were on average 29 years old, mostly men (77%), single (75%), with at least secondary studies (73%) and in active employment (63%). Marijuana joints (N=232) contained a median of 6.56mg of 9-THC (Interquartile range-IQR=10,22) and 0.02mg of CBD (IQR=0.02); hashish joints (N=83) a median of 7.94mg of 9-THC (IQR=10,61) and 3.24mg of CBD (IQR=3.21). Participants rolled 4 joints per gram of cannabis and paid 5€ per gram (median values).
3:::Groups did not differ significantly in judgments of permissibility or authority-contingency, or justifications of judgments. Patients did, however, rate violations of social (but not moral) convention more harshly. They also took longer to judge impermissibility of moral (but nor social) transgressions. Slower moral judgment in patients was associated with lower levels of self-reported empathic concern, while harsher condemnation of social transgression was associated with poorer (self-reported) perspective-taking.
3:::In both Norway and Spain and across ages, negative affect predisposed children to symptoms of all disorders except CD, low effortful control predisposed children to ADHD and ODD-symptoms, and surgency predisposed children to increased ADHD-symptoms. Complication effects were observed in the Spanish children for ADHD-symptoms, which increased surgency and diminished effortful control, and for ODD-symptoms, which decreased surgency. The common cause and pathoplasty/exacerbation explanations were not supported.
3:::The Abbott HIV-1 DBS protocol had an LOD of 839 copies/mL, a linear range from 500 to 1×10(7) copies/mL, an LLQ of 839 copies/mL, a ULQ of 1×10(7) copies/mL, and an inter-assay SD of ≤0.30 log copies/mL for all tested levels within this range. With clinical samples, the correlation coefficient (r value) was 0.896 between DBS-fingerprick and plasma and 0.901 between DBS-venous and plasma, and the bias was -0.07 log copies/mL between DBS-fingerprick and plasma and -0.02 log copies/mL between DBS-venous and plasma. The sensitivity of DBS-fingerprick and DBS-venous was 93%, while the specificity of both DBS methods was 95%.
3:::We included 1038 children; of these, 506 were girls. The latent class analysis model with the best fit to PASTURE data separated 4 phenotypes of atopic dermatitis in childhood: 2 early phenotypes with onset before age 2 years (early transient [n = 96; 9.2%] and early persistent [n = 67; 6.5%]), the late phenotype with onset at age 2 years or older (n = 50; 4.8%), and the never/infrequent phenotype (n = 825; 79.5%), defined as children with no atopic dermatitis. Children with both parents with history of allergies were 5 times more at risk to develop atopic dermatitis with an early-persistent phenotype compared with children with parents with no history of allergies. Both early phenotypes were strongly associated with food allergy. The risk of developing asthma was significantly increased among the early-persistent phenotype (adjusted odds ratio, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.31-6.31). The late phenotype was only positively associated with allergic rhinitis.
3:::Controlling for BMI and depressive symptoms, lower sCRP was associated both with greater frequency of positive parental behaviors, t = -3.087, p = .003 and less frequency of aggressive parental behavior (t = 2.087, p = .041) in the conflictual task. Trend associations between positive behavior during the positive task and lower sCRP were also found.
3:::The raMOLLI sequence allowed a significant decrease of myocardial T1 map acquisition time down to five heartbeats, while exhibiting a higher degree of accuracy and a comparable precision on T1 value estimation than the conventional modified Look-Locker inversion recovery sequence. The FLASH readout demonstrated a better robustness to B0 inhomogeneities than TrueFISP, and was therefore preferred for in vivo acquisitions.
3:::Over the study period, the mean RBC units transfused per admission decreased 39% from 6.1 to 3.7 (p < 0.001), and the mean PLT units transfused decreased 35% from 6.3 to 4.1 (p < 0.001), with mean RBC and PLT units transfused for follow-up day cases decreasing from 0.6 to 0.4 units (p < 0.001). Mean pre-RBC transfusion Hb level decreased from 8.0 to 6.8 g/dL (p < 0.001), and single-unit RBC transfusions increased 39% to 67% (p < 0.001). This reduction represents blood product cost savings of AU$694,886 (US$654,007). There were no significant changes in unadjusted or adjusted length of stay, serious bleeding events, or in-hospital mortality over the study.
3:::Analyses showed that (a) SSS was inversely associated with BMI among young adults, (b) objective SES in both adulthood and early life explained about half of this relationship, (c) SSS appeared to offer a partial explanation for the association between SES (in both adulthood and early life) and BMI, (d) health behaviors, psychological characteristics, self-rated health, and perceived stress explained part of the relationship between SSS and BMI after controlling for SES and other covariates, and (e) SSS had a residual association with BMI that was not accounted for by any of the variables in the full model.
3:::One hundred and seventy-two IBS patients (Rome III; 69% female; mean age 33.7 [range 18-60] years) were included. The optimal subgrouping showed six latent groups, characterised by: (I) constipation with low comorbidities, (II) constipation with high comorbidities, (III) diarrhoea with low comorbidities, (IV) diarrhoea and pain with high comorbidities, (V) mixed GI symptoms with high comorbidities, (VI) a mix of symptoms with overall mild severity. The subgroups showed differences in the distribution of Rome III-subtypes, IBS severity, presence of anxiety and depression, and gender, but not regarding age, IBS duration or reported post-infectious onset of IBS.
3:::Composite restorations formed the majority (93%). The longest median survival times and the smallest failure rates were found for teeth in the upper jaw, for premolars, and for 2-surface restorations. Median survival time of all restorations was 9.9 years (95% CI 9.6, 10.2) and re-intervention of restorations occurred less often in the maxilla (AFR 4.0%) than in the mandible (AFR 4.7%). Median survival time of composite restorations was greater for 2-surface than for 3-surface restorations: in premolars 12.3 vs. 9.6 years (p<0.001) and in molars, 9.2 vs. 6.3 years (p<0.001); for molar amalgams the difference (8.0 vs. 6.3 years) was non-significant (p=0.38). Median survival time of 2- and 3-surface restorations in premolars exceeded that in molars (12.0 vs. 8.7 years; p<0.001).
3:::A total of 307 children participated in the Childhood Health, Activity, and Motor Performance School (CHAMPS) Eye Study. The cycloplegic spherical equivalent (SE) was 0.30 ± 1.46 dioptres. The prevalence of myopia was 17.9% (SE ≤-0.5 dioptres). Mean axial length (AL) was 23.5 ± 0.9 mm. For all participants, the overall mean daily distribution of PA was 67.2% in sedentary, 25.6% in light, 4.4% in moderate and 2.9% in vigorous PA. Age- and sex-adjusted linear regression showed no association between PA and SE or AL. In a prospective slope analysis, there was no association between accumulated PA during the 7 years and AL or SE.
3:::In the first protocol, we observed a time dependent increase in the ischemic and hyperemic responses to occlusion. Next, we observed a lower hyperemic response after local cooling (9.8±4.2 versus 17.8±2.5% respectively, P<0.001), while in contrast, the ischemic response was higher and exhibited greater variability (23±15 versus 11.8±6.4%; P=0.028). In the third protocol, the inter-day reproducibility of flow mediated skin fluorescence for a 3min occlusion period was excellent. The ischemic response was significantly lower in CAD patients than in healthy controls (6.7±4.8% vs 14.7±6.8% respectively, P<0.001). Similarly, the hyperemic response was significantly decreased in the CAD group compared to healthy controls (11.6±3.6% vs 19.5±5.4% respectively, P<0.001).
3:::Well performing NLP models were generated to categorize medication related events into pharmacy delivery delays, dispensing errors, Pyxis discrepancies, and prescriber errors with receiver operating characteristic areas under the curve of 0.96, 0.87, 0.96, and 0.81 respectively. We also found that modeling the brief without the resolution text generally improved model performance. These models were integrated into a dashboard visualization to support the patient safety committee review process.
3:::Priming performances discriminated between individuals with MCI and mild dementia but not between MCI and healthy. Additionally, this effect was most salient in individuals with low levels of education. Education did not moderate explicit memory performances in predicting group membership.
3:::Following 7 days of space opening, the margin of the interdental papilla between the lower incisors gradually became irregular and flat indicating a condition similar to the open gingival embrasure (p<0.05). Local injection of HA filler induced augmentation effect of the interdental papilla compared to the injection of PBS (p<0.05). Interdental papilla became convex and inner granules containing HA were detected within the submucosal layer following its injection.
3:::Retinal haemorrhage (RH) was found in 550 (18%) of 3123 high-risk infants. Retinal haemorrhage (RH) was classified as grade I (39%), grade II (24%) and grade III (37%). Monocular RH occurred in 37% of cases, while the remaining cases were binocular. Moreover, six cases had vitreous haemorrhage. The following parameters correlated (p < 0.05) with RH in this study: delivery mode (χ(2)  = 469), gestational age (χ(2)  = 35), birth weight (χ(2)  = 18), asphyxia (χ(2)  = 73), scalp hematoma (χ(2)  = 55), maternal age (χ(2)  = 8.9), precipitate labour (χ(2)  = 120) and delivery times (χ(2)  = 6.1). Logistic regression analysis indicated that delivery mode and asphyxia were risk factors for RH in high-risk infants, with odds ratios of 0.827 and 2.5, respectively. Gender, intracranial haemorrhage and foetal distress were not correlated with RH in high-risk infants.
3:::Significant correlations were found between locoregional recurrence and pathologic N-Classification (<0.001), UICC stage (<0.001), perineural invasion (p = 0.025), grading (p = 0.001), number of resected lymph nodes (p = 0.007) and lymph node ratio (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated lymph node ratio as solely independent risk factor for locoregional recurrence.
3:::From 2004-2013, oral abuse decreased from 73.1% to 58.9%; injection abuse increased from 11.7% to 18.1%; and smoking/inhalation abuse increased from 15.3% of admissions to 23.0%. Among treatment admissions, the following were associated with injection abuse: male sex, 18-54 year-olds, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic other, homeless or dependent living, less than full-time work, living in the Midwest or South, ≥1 prior treatment episodes, younger age of first opioid use, and reporting use of cocaine/crack, marijuana, heroin, or methamphetamine.
3:::The median Fremantle Back Awareness Questionnaire score for the pain free women was 1 (IQR 0-1.5) and the median score for those in pain was 3.5 (IQR 2-8). This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.005). The questionnaire score was significantly correlated with pain intensity but not with disability. Of the measured variables only pain catastrophisation was significantly associated with disrupted body-image.
3:::IPSS score of incomplete urination (42.3 ± 2.04%), frequency of urination (20.08 ± 1.02%), intermittency (40.78 ± 2.16%), urgency (60.91 ± 3.14%), weak stream (50.58 ± 2.14%), straining (55.67 ± 2.53%) and nocturia (40.14 ± 1.89%) in treatment group were significantly decreased after treatment compare to placebo receiving group. Furthermore, the prostate volume (16.92 ± 0.89%) and extant urine volume (28.12 ± 1.36%) also significantly decreased in treatment group compared to control group. No significant side effects or abnormalities in biochemical tests and urinalysis were observed throughout the study.
3:::The cases showed less frequent Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infections (45.1% versus 60.7%, p = .005), more frequent duodenal location (31.8% versus 19.1%, p = .009), and more frequent rebleeding (13.9% versus 5.8%, p = .02) than the controls. Multivariate analysis revealed that duodenal location (odds ratio [OR] 3.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-6.65) and use of antithrombotic medications (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.13-5.77) were independent factors for rebleeding. However, there were no differences in clinical outcomes, including final successful endoscopic hemostasis, need for surgical intervention, and mortality between cases and controls. Thromboembolic events did not occur in any cases and controls during the periendoscopic period.
3:::In the period April 2013 to December, 110 cases were reported, 71 nominal and 39 non-nominal. The annual incidence increased from 9.0 cases per 100,000 to 13.4. Of the cases investigated, 63 were women and 8 men. The mean age was 40.8 years (38.5-43.1 95% CI). 58 cases (81.7%) corresponded to teachers. In 22 of the 71 nodules (31%) and 9 coincidences were notified as an occupational disease. We found a greater presence of nodules in professionals with extra work use of voice (OR 4.2 IC 1.3-14.3) and better evolution of pathologies other than VN (OR = 2.5 CI 1.1-5.8 ). The suspicion was confirmed as occupational in 54 cases (positive predictive value 76.1%).
3:::Our results confirmed that CCAT2 expression levels in tumor tissues were markedly increased than that in adjacent normal tissues. Higher CCAT2 expression was found to show a significantly correlation with advanced TNM stage and lymph node metastasis in patients. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank test showed that higher CCAT2 expression was closely correlated with shorter over survival (OS) time in patients. In vitro, knockdown of CCAT2 showed that cell proliferation and invasion capabilities were suppressed and increased G0-G1 phase cell proportion but reduced S phase cell proportion in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, when CCAT2 silencing, the cell cycle relative protein CyclinD1, CyclinE1 and CDK4 expression were downregulated, but p15 was up-regulated in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Besides, we confirmed that CCAT2 suppressed the p15 expression level via interacting with EZH2 in breast cancer cells. In vivo, the tumor growth was inhibited after knockdown of CCAT2.
3:::Nineteen patients were assigned to four CAP7.1 dose cohorts (45, 90, 150 and 200 mg/m(2)/day). CAP7.1 was well tolerated. Haematotoxicity was observed at the two highest dose levels including three DLTs (two febrile neutropenia and one sepsis) only and were reversible with adequate therapy. No organ toxicity was observed. Non-haematological toxicities (mild-moderate) consist mainly of nausea, fatigue, vomiting, pyrexia and alopecia. One partial response and 11 stable diseases were observed as supporting signs of efficacy.
3:::Multilevel analyses showed that anhedonia was associated with less intense pleasure experience, and lower levels of PA. Contrary to predictions from laboratory research and depression theory, individuals with anhedonia showed more variability and less stability in PA, and no signs of blunted PA reactivity. In fact, when exploring high and low arousal PA, individuals with anhedonia showed a slightly stronger reactivity to pleasurable experiences in high-arousal PA but not low-arousal PA.
3:::The results from our searches included a total of 125 cases of postpartum ACPO. A total of 66 cases were reported in 37 publications after year 2002. Details of delivery were recorded in 13(19%), clinical manifestations in 49(69%), imaging results in 43(65%) and management described in 100% of the cases. Although 62(92%) cases were following caesarean section, no specific antepartum or intrapartum factors were associated with ACPO. The caesarean sections performed for indications of preeclampsia, multiple pregnancy, antepartum haemorrhage/placenta previa were more in this group of patients who developed ACPO compared to caesarean sections performed for same indication in general population of England and Wales. Abdominal distension and pain were the commonest symptoms, followed by vomiting. Fever was common in patients with perforation. Twenty eight (43%) patients had intestinal perforation or impending perforation, and 31(47%) patients required laparotomy. Conservative management was successful in 33(50%) patients. All patients with a caecal diameter of more than 12cm perforated compared to 3/17 with a diameter of less than 9cm. Most perforations were diagnosed between postoperative day 3 and day 5. Only one case of mortality has been recorded (1.5%).
3:::Cross-sectional area of the condyle ipsilateral to the atretic ear was, on average, 8.41 mm(2) smaller than the contralateral condyle (P < .0001). The Jahrsdoerfer score was not associated with the condylar cross-sectional area, age, or sex.
3:::Immediately after the intervention, there were moderate effects on both near, intermediate and distal measures of language performance. At delayed follow-up (7 months after the intervention), these reliable effects remained for the distal measures.
3:::On multivariate analysis of the unmatched cohort accounting for demographics and confounders, no significant difference in overall medical complications was identified between groups (odds ratio = 0.799, P = 0.495). Propensity matching corrected for all significantly distributed comorbidities, except for alcohol, which remained associated with the smoking group (P = < 0.001). In the matched population, there were no significant differences in complication rates between the two groups. Pack-year data was available for 340 patients. These cases were subdivided into cohorts with < 50 (n = 204) and 51+ (n = 136) pack-years. Postoperative pneumonia, ventilation for more than 48 hours, sepsis, and overall medical complications were associated with > 50 pack-years of smoking. After multivariate regression, sepsis and overall medical complications remained significant for the 51+ pack-year smoking cohort.
3:::Renal artery denervation, using the second generation EnligHTN multi-electrode system significantly reduced office blood pressure from baseline to 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months by 19/7, 26/9, 25/7, 23/7, 25/8 and 27/9 mmHg, respectively (p ≤ 0.0005). No serious device or procedure related adverse events affecting the renal arteries or renal function occurred through 24 months of follow-up.
3:::There were 17,777 patients identified; 5.0% (N = 889) had an additional diagnosis of OSA. The OSA cohort had more comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, coagulopathy, hypertension, hypothyroidism, liver disease, obesity, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, acromegaly, and Cushings syndrome. Postoperatively, OSA was independently associated with increased risks of tracheostomy (P = .015) and hypoxemia (P < .001), and decreased risk of cardiac complications (P = .034). OSA patients did not have increased rates of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, diabetes insipidus, reintubation, aspiration pneumonia, infectious pneumonia, thromboembolic complications, or urinary/renal complications. In-hospital mortality rates did not vary between the two cohorts.'
3:::During a median follow-up time of 15.8 years (153,103 person years at risk), 1338 incident cases of fatal/non-fatal CVD occurred (672 fatal/non-fatal MI, 545 stroke and 302 HF). When NT, BOP and NDP were all included in the same model with age, sex, smoking, calendar time, and education level, NT and NDP, but not BOP, were significantly related to future CVD (combined end-point, p = 0.0003 for NT and p = 0.007 for NDP). In similar analyses of 3 separate CVD outcomes, NT was significantly related to MI, with an incidence rate ratio (IRR) for a given interquartile range change of 0.90 (95% CI 0.82-0.99) and to HF, with an IRR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.77-0.99). However, NT was not significantly related to stroke. BOP and NDP were not significantly related to any of the three separate CVD outcomes.
3:::A greater percentage of people with epilepsy and their partners compared with respective control subjects received social services (sick pay or disability pension). Those with epilepsy had a lower employment rate than did controls for equivalent periods up to eight years before the diagnosis was made. Mortality was significantly higher in people with epilepsy than in control individuals (hazard ratio 2.38 (95% CI: 2.34, 2.41). The additional direct and indirect annual costs of epilepsy compared with controls were €11,223 for persons with epilepsy and €2,494 for their partners.
3:::Herein, the result indicated that IF remarkably bated cell proliferation in human colorectal cancer cells HT-29 and SW-480 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, IF treatment showed obvious inhibitory activity to cell colony formation in HT-29 and SW-480 cells. Confocal microscopy analysis and flow cytometry detection revealed that IF dramatically induced cell apoptosis in HT-29 and SW-480 cells compared with the control. And IF markedly decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2, whereas the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, including caspase-3, caspase-9 and bax, notably increased in HT-29 and SW-480 cells. Besides, IF blocked Akt pathway via inhibition expression of p-Akt. Furthermore, MK2206, an Akt inhibitor, could inhibit cell colony formation and induced apoptosis. This effect is even more obvious in the presence of MK2206 and IF compared to that of either agent alone.
3:::The Numb protein expression was decreased with Glease score increasing. The proliferation rate of Numb groups were significantly decreased compared with NC groups (P<0.05, respectively). The apoptosis and G1 phase rates of Numb groups were significantly enhanced compared with NC groups (P<0.05, respectively). The invasion and migration abilities of Numb group cells were significantly weaken compared with NC groups (P<0.05, respectively). In the WB assay, The relative proteins (Numb, P53, Cyclin D1, Rac1, MMP-2 and MMP-9) expression were significantly differences between NC and Numb groups (P<0.05, respectively). In the vivo experiment, the tumor volume and weight of Numb group was significantly lighter than NC group (P<0.05, respectively).
3:::A total of 3258 abstracts were screened, with 40 studies included in the review. Overall prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus was 5.4% (3.8-7.8). Maternal age, year of data collection, country, area of Europe, week of gestation at testing, and diagnostic criteria were found to have a significant univariate effect on GDM prevalence, and area, week of gestation at testing and year of data collection remained statistically significant in multivariate analysis. Quality category was significant in multivariate but not univariate analysis.
3:::Thirteen eligible papers reporting LIPUS treatment of 1441 nonunions were evaluated. The pooled estimate of effect size for heal rate was 82% (95% CI: 77-87%), for any anatomical site and fracture age of at least 3 months, with statistical heterogeneity detected across all primary studies (Q=41.2 (df=12), p<0.001, Tau(2)=0.006, I(2)=71). With a stricter definition of nonunion as fracture age of at least 8 months duration, the pooled estimate of effect size was 84% (95% CI: 77%-91.6%; heterogeneity present: Q=21 (df=8), p<0.001, Tau(2)=0.007, I(2)=62). Hypertrophic nonunions benefitted more than biologically inactive atrophic nonunions. An interval without surgery of <6months prior to LIPUS was associated with a more favorable result. Stratification of nonunions by anatomical site revealed no statistically significant differences between upper and lower extremity long bone nonunions.
3:::A total of 77 patients were included and were divided into 2 groups: 1) the younger group consisted of 20 patients <40 years of age; and 2) the elder group had 57 patients who were 40-50 years of age. The overall detection rate of PCa was 11.69% (9/77), and all of the PCa cases were diagnosed in the elder group (group detection rate: 15.8%). There was a significant difference in the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) between these 2 groups. All PCa patients were clinically significant according to the Epstein criteria. Two patients experienced fever (2.60%) after TRUSP biopsy.
3:::The AOFAS score improved from 31±11 pre operatively, to 65±25 at the last (p<0.0005). Fourteen failures occurred, with 70.8% allograft rate of survival. All the surviving allografts showed a reduction of the ankle joint movement, still associated with a satisfactory clinical result.
3:::Over that period, 2140 OGTTs were performed in 1725 pregnant women. The prevalence of GDM was 14.8% (255/1725 women) under old ADIPS criteria, but went up to 29.6% (510/1725) when using WHO criteria. An increase in prevalence was observed in all ethnic groups. Women from East/South-East Asia had the lowest increment (from 19.2 to 22.3%) while those from South Asia had the highest (from 22.0 to 44.4%). Prevalence of GDM was 45.9% amongst women with BMI>30kg/m(2). For women from South Asia with BMI>30kg/m(2), 70.0% would have GDM. Birth outcomes were similar between women who would have GDM under WHO but not the old ADIPS criteria (untreated), and those who were treated for GDM under old criteria.
3:::Rats exposed to SPS exhibited both anxiety- and depression-like behavior at PND32. And, short-term (STM) but not long-term memory (LTM) was impaired. Rats exposed to SPS at PND60 exhibited anxiety- but not depression-like behavior. STM but not LTM was impaired. Rats exposed to SPS at PND90 exhibited fearful (as indicated by elevated plus maze test) but not an overall anxiety-like behavior (in light and dark test). These rats also displayed significant depression-like behavior with no changes in STM or LTM. Interestingly, when data was further analyzed, two subsets of PND90 rats exposed to SPS were identified, ""susceptible"": with depression-like behavior and ""resilient"": without depression-like behavior. Importantly, while resilient group expressed early signs of anxiety- (at PND32 and PND60) and depression-like behavior (at PND32), these behavioral deficits were absent at PND90. On the other hand, susceptible PND90 rats exposed to SPS expressed later onset of anxiety-like behavior (at PND60), while depression-like phenotype was evident only later on at PND90.
3:::One hundred eighty-two women participated in the survey. The majority were white (83.52%), married (52.49%), had ≥1 pregnancy (54.40%), and in excellent health (93.41%). The average age and body mass index were 47.28 ± 13.56 years and 27.92 ± 6.78, respectively. The sample was further sub-divided into two groups: urinary urgency (N = 119) or no urinary urgency symptoms (N = 51). Habitual toileting behaviors for these groups (N = 170) included: sitting to urinate at home (98.24%), emptying the bladder completely (88.82%), emptying the bladder before leaving home (80.00%), and sitting to urinate when away from home (68.82%). Logistic regression analysis showed age increased the odds of urinary urgency (aOR 1.06, 95%CI 1.02-1.09). Women who waited too long to urinate at work (aOR 7.85, 95%CI 1.57-39.24) and wore panty liners for urinary leakage (aOR 2.86, 95%CI 1.25-6.56) had greater odds of urinary urgency than women who did neither.
3:::In this study, our data showed that macrophages were preferentially differentiated into the M1 type during the acute stage of N. caninum infection, while the level of M2 macrophages significantly increased during the chronic stage of infection. In vitro study, compared with the GW9662 group and RGZ group, N. caninum can promote M2-polarized phenotype through up-regulate the activity of PPAR-γ and inhibting NF-κB activation.
3:::In our case, despite the presence of clinical signs similar to a surgical site infection, the wound healing was most likely interrupted and delayed secondary to the electric field generated due to the frequent recharges of the pulse generator.
3:::A total of 178 children (106 boys, 59.5%) with a mean age of 9.7 years were included the study. NC was above the 90th percentile in 65 children. Importantly, pulmonary parameters, such as forced expiratory volume during the first second (FEV1) and the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FVC), were lower in subjects with a large NC. Similarly, waist circumference was above the 90th percentile in 67 children, and FEV1/FVC was significantly lower in children with a large waist circumference. Moreover, there was a statistically significant negative correlation among FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and body mass index SD score. Also, multivariable linear regression analysis showed that an NC above the 90th percentile was associated with lower FEV1 and FEV1/FVC values.
3:::Intrareliability demonstrated an excellent agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient mean = 0.93). Descriptive analysis showed that the fracture line measurement was smaller in the post and metal crown groups than in the no-filling and gutta-percha groups. The 1-way analysis of variance test found statistically significant differences among the groups measurements. The Bonferroni correction showed statistically significant differences related to the no-filling and gutta-percha groups versus the post and metal crown groups.
3:::By Western blot, bands were detected at the expected molecular weight for TRPA1. TRPA1- and TRPV1-immunoreactivities were located on CGRP-positive nerves, but not on TH-positive nerves. TRPA1 was also located in vimentin-positive interstitial cells. In functional experiments, neither of the TRPA1-agonists (1-100 μM) had any direct effects on ureter tension (baseline/potassium-induced contractions). However, CA, AI, NaHS, and capsaicin (10 μM) decreased (P < 0.01-0.05) tetrodotoxin-sensitive electrically induced (2,4,8,16,32 Hz) contractions. Inhibitory activities were 50-61% (CA), 30-56% (AI), 30-40% (NaHS), and 37-67% (Capsaicin).
3:::Western blotting showed the presence of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in both dental cell types. LIPUS treatment significantly increased the level of the Piezo proteins in DPSCs after 24 hours; however, no significant effects were observed in PDLSCs. Treatment with RR significantly inhibited LIPUS-stimulated DPSC proliferation but not PDLSC proliferation. Extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1/2 MAPK was consistently activated in DPSCs over a 24-hour time period after LIPUS exposure, whereas phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK were mainly increased in PDLSCs. RR affected MAPK signaling in both dental cell types with its most prominent effects on ERK1/2/MAPK phosphorylation levels; the significant inhibition of LIPUS-induced stimulation of ERK1/2 activation in DPSCs by RR suggests that stimulation of DPSC proliferation by LIPUS involves Piezo-mediated regulation of ERK1/2 MAPK signaling.
3:::There was a significant difference between the mean preoperative lesion volumes of 95.34 mm(3) (n = 51, standard deviation [SD] ±196.28 mm(3)) versus 6.48 mm(3) (n = 51, SD ±17.70 mm(3)) at follow-up (P < .05). The mean volume reduction was 83.7%. Preoperatively, mean lesion areas on periapical films were 13.55 mm(2) (n = 51, SD ±18.80 mm(2)) and 1.83 mm(2) (n = 51, SD ±.68 mm(2)) at follow-up (P < .05). According to Molvens criteria, 40 teeth were classified as complete healing, 7 as incomplete healing, and 4 as uncertain healing. Based on the modified PENN 3D criteria, 33 teeth were classified as complete healing, 14 as limited healing, 1 as uncertain healing, and 3 as unsatisfactory healing. The variation in the distribution of the 2D and 3D healing classifications was significantly different (P < .05). Periapical healing statuses incomplete healing or uncertain healing according to Molven's criteria could be clearly classified using 3D criteria.'
3:::There were 253 deaths during a mean follow-up of 5.7 years. Increased SFA was associated with decreased all-cause mortality, whereas an increased VFA and VSR were related to increased all-cause mortality. Compared with the predictive power of body mass index (BMI), SFA and VSR showed a larger area under the curve than did BMI. In Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, increased SFA and VSR were associated with decreased and increased hazard of all-cause death, respectively. However, in multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, only VSR was independently associated with all-cause mortality. Moreover, this relationship was paralleled by the harmful impact of increased VSR on metabolic profiles.
3:::The expression of TIMP-3, TIMP-4, iNOS, and CD68 was significantly higher in both the cyst and granuloma groups than in the control group. TIMP-4 was also significantly higher in cases of chronic apical abscess. There was also a significant difference in the expression of MMP-14 between the cyst and control groups. However, there were no differences in the expression of MMP-19 between the 3 groups.
3:::The detection rates for extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers in blood and stool culture samples decreased significantly after the implementation of antibiotic cycling (0.33/1000 patient-days vs 0/1000 patient-days, p = 0.03; 1.00/1000 patient-days vs 0/1000 patient-days, p < 0.01; respectively).
3:::The automated particle detection algorithm was applied to a typical immunogold dataset of neural tissue, and was able to detect particles with a high degree of precision. Without manual correction, the algorithm detected 97% of all gold particles, with merely a 0.1% false-positive rate.
3:::There was no significant difference between Strategies A and B in percentages of patients achieving the primary endpoint (64.5% vs 54.9%; P=0.190). Mean incidences (A vs B) of total (10.2% vs 53.8%), documented symptomatic (5.1% vs 36.6%), and asymptomatic (8.2% vs 32.3%) hypoglycaemia were lower for Strategy-A (P<0.001 each). Proportions of patients achieving/maintaining HbA1c target (A, 63.3% vs B, 55.9%) were similar.
3:::In 2015, there were an estimated 422.7 million cases of CVD (95% uncertainty interval: 415.53 to 427.87 million cases) and 17.92 million CVD deaths (95% uncertainty interval: 17.59 to 18.28 million CVD deaths). Declines in the age-standardized CVD death rate occurred between 1990 and 2015 in all high-income and some middle-income countries. Ischemic heart disease was the leading cause of CVD health lost globally, as well as in each world region, followed by stroke. As SDI increased beyond 0.25, the highest CVD mortality shifted from women to men. CVD mortality decreased sharply for both sexes in countries with an SDI >0.75.
3:::The HyFlex EDM file (3456.33 ± 633.37) file had the statistically highest fatigue resistance, and the OneShape file (1221.63 ± 812.4) had the least fatigue resistance (P < .05). The mean number of cycles to fracture of the Reciproc Blue file (2875.89 ± 105.35) file was statistically higher than the WaveOne Gold file (1737.00 ± 376.32) (P < .05). There was no statistically significant difference (P > .05) in the mean length of the fractured fragments of the files (P > .05).
3:::Overall, latrine use was poor and inconsistent. The average response probability at any given round of never use was 43.5% (95% CI=37.9, 49.1), sometimes use was 4.6% (95% CI=3.8, 5.5), and always/usual use was 51.9% (95% CI=46.2, 57.5). Only two-thirds of those who reported always/usually using a latrine in round one reported the same for all three rounds. Across all three rounds, the study population was about equally divided among those who reported never using the latrine (30.1%, 95% CI=23.0, 37.2), sometimes using the latrine (33.2%, 95% CI=28.3, 38.1) and always/usually using the latrine (36.8%, 95% CI=31.8, 41.8). The reported likelihood of always/usually versus never using the latrine was significantly greater in the dry cold season (OR=1.50, 95% CI=1.18, 1.89, p=0.001) and in the rainy season (OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.07, 1.69, p=0.012), than in the dry hot season. Across all three seasons, there was increased likelihood of always/usually and sometimes using the latrine versus never using it among females and where latrines had a door and roof. Older age groups, including those aged 41-59 years and 60+ years, and increase in household size were associated with a decreased likelihood of always/usually using the latrine versus never using it. The leading reason for non-use was a preference for open defecation.
3:::Fifty-two percent of the SLIMMER participants had a low SES. No differences in participation were observed between the low and higher SES group. The most important reason for non-participation in the low SES group was lack of interest' (32%), whereas in the higher SES group this was 'I already exercise enough' (31%). Attendance, acceptability, adherence, drop-out, and effectiveness after 12months were similar in the low and higher SES group. After 18months, the low SES group seemed to maintain slightly better effects for fasting insulin, HbA1c, and waist circumference.'
3:::Totally, 17 patients (7 in LVD and 10 in ETV group) were recruited, and 3 patients (17.7%) died or received liver transplantation due to hepatic failure. The median HBV DNA decline on days 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 85, and 180 were 1.38 (1.09-1.50), 2.36 (1.89-2.58), 3.19 (2.21-3.51), 3.76 (2.54-4.40), 3.43 (2.44-4.75), 4.00 (3.01-5.04), 5.00 (3.61-6.21), and 6.50 (4.12-7.20) log IU/mL, respectively. The baseline characteristics were basically similar between the two groups, and the dynamic changes in HBV DNA were not significantly different between the two groups. Further analysis of the patients with high HBV viral load (>6 log IU/mL) revealed that a similar baseline HBV DNA level in the two groups (LVD vs ETV: median 8.0 [7.5-8.8] vs 7.7 [6.6-8.4] log IU/mL; P=0.45), and the dynamic changes of HBV DNA were very similar.
3:::Polymerizable diols 3 and 4 as well as (N-methyl)acrylamides 7-9 were found to be significantly more reactive than HEMA. Resins based on the hydrophilic monomers 3, 7 and 8 exhibited a significantly higher water sorption than the corresponding HEMA-containing material. Luting composites containing monomers 2, 3, 6 and 7 showed similar or even improved mechanical properties compared to the reference material containing HEMA. Self-etch adhesives containing monomers 4 and 9 provided significantly higher dentin SBS than the reference material.
3:::A total of 119 participants developed reduced renal function during follow-up. ABI, PWV, NT-proBNP and hsTnT were all associated with onset of decline in renal function following adjustment for age and sex. These associations were attenuated after adjustment for additional diabetes renal disease risk factors (systolic BP, baseline eGFR, albumin:creatinine ratio and smoking pack-years), with the exception of hsTnT which remained independently associated (HR 1.51 [95% CI 1.22, 1.87]). Inclusion of hsTnT in a predictive model improved the continuous net reclassification index by 0.165 (0.008, 0.286).
3:::Both treatments presented statistically significant clinical and microbiological improvements. However, CLM presented lower means of pocket depth for pockets ≥ 7 mm at 6 months (4.0 ± 1.7) when compared to placebo group (4.7 ± 1.3) (p=0.04). In addition, CLM group also presented greater reduction of P. gingivalis DNA counts at 6 months (p=0.0001).
3:::We found increases in serum RBP4 levels and the RBP4:retinol ratio but not in the retinol levels in GDM rats. Exogenous apo-RBP4 injection attenuated insulin sensitivity in pregnant rats. In vitro, a prolonged interaction between RBP4 and STRA6 was observed when apo-RBP4 was present. In response to increased apo-RBP4 levels, cells showed elevated activation of the JAK2/STAT5 cascade and SOCS3 expression, decreased phosphorylation of IR and IRS1, and attenuated GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake upon insulin stimulation.
3:::The mean CSA in the study group in neutral, internal and external rotations were 33°, 34° and 34°, respectively. Corresponding values in the control group were 32°, 32° and 32°. The interclass correlation coefficient for the whole population between the two examiners were 0.956 (P < 0.01), 0.964 (P < 0.01) and 0.955 (P < 0.01), respectively.
3:::The Cox regression model after adjusting for demographic data, psychiatric comorbidities, and medical comorbidities showed that BPD was associated with an increased risk of developing any stroke (HR: 4.82, 95% CI: 2.77-8.40) and ischemic stroke (HR: 5.67, 95% CI: 2.49-12.93). The findings of sensitivity analysis after excluding the first year of observation were consistent: any stroke (HR: 3.44, 95% CI: 1.83-6.47) and ischemic stroke (HR: 4.75, 95% CI: 1.91-11.77).
3:::The addition of a vinyl chain in the fluoromethoxy moiety did not negatively alter the affinity of [(11)C]7b for the NMDAr, while lipophilicity was increased. Biodistribution studies showed higher uptake of [(11)C]7b in forebrain regions compared with cerebellum. Pre-treatment with MK-801 decreased the overall brain uptake significantly, but not in a region-specific manner. 45min after injection 78, 90 and 87% of activity in the brain was due to parent compound for [(11)C]1, [(18)F]2 and [(11)C]7b, respectively. In plasma, 26-31% of activity was due to parent compound.
3:::The mean OSDI score was 45.6 ± 23.1. At least some degree of ocular pain (score >1) was reported by 88.1% of patients, including mild pain (scores 2-4) in 46.4%, moderate pain (scores 5-7) in 34.5%, and severe pain (scores 8-10) in 7.1% of patients. Ocular pain levels significantly correlated with the OSDI score (rs = 0.49, P < .001). Regression analysis showed that the severity of ocular pain had a significant association with use of antidepressant medications (P = .045) but not with tear breakup time, corneal fluorescein staining, or ocular medications used by patients. In patients without pain, a significant correlation was seen between OSDI and corneal fluorescein staining scores (rs = 0.67, P = .01). However, such a correlation was not observed in those with ocular pain.
3:::Problem gambling with ASPD was associated with significantly elevated gambling disorder symptoms, lower quality of life, greater psychiatric comorbidity, higher impulsivity questionnaire scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (d=0.4) and Eysenck Impulsivity Questionnaire (d=0.5), and impaired cognitive flexibility (d=0.4), executive planning (d=0.4), and an aspect of decision-making (d=0.6). Performance on measures of response inhibition, risk adjustment, and quality of decision making did not differ significantly between groups.
3:::Multivariate logistic regression showed that following factors were associated with longer operative time: gender, tumor size and malignant lesions. In another model it was shown that age, size of the tumor and malignancy were associated with more excessive blood loss. Moreover, it was shown, that tumor size predictive factor for conversion. Univariate analysis showed a relation with malignancy, but multivariate analysis revealed no significance.
3:::52 patients with SE and 63 with CS received either LEV or DPH. In the SE group, LEV was effective in18/22(82%) and DPH in 22/30(73.3%) patients in controlling seizures. Among patients with CS, LEV was effective in 31/38(81.6%) and DPH in 20/25(80%). With the use of LEV, DPH or both, SE and CS were controlled among 92% and 96% of patients respectively. Adverse events included hypotension (in 2 on DPH) and transient agitation (2 on LEV).
3:::The expression of Rv2626c-enhanced M. smegmatis survival under hypoxia and nitric oxide stress in vitro, and this enhancement was maintained within macrophages and in mouse tissues. In addition, macrophages infected with M. smegmatis expressing Rv2626c showed significantly higher interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, as well as a higher level of cell necrosis, compared with the control.
3:::Findings showed that while Mav101 was very similar to Mav104, there were numerous differences between Mav104 and the remaining strains at nucleotide and predicted protein levels. The presence of genes associated with biofilm formation and several known virulence-related genes were sometimes differentially present among the isolates, suggesting overlapping functions by different genetic determinants.
3:::The extract (30, 100 and 300mgkg(-1), p.o.) significantly delayed the onset as well as decreased the duration and frequency of pentylenetetrazole-, picrotoxin- and strychnine-induced seizures. In addition, PME pre-treatment significantly improved survival in the 4-aminopyridine- and isoniazid-induced seizure tests. Furthermore, the extract protected against 6-Hz psychomotor seizures but had no effect in the maximal electroshock test. The anticonvulsant effect of PME (100mgkg(-1), p.o.) was also reversed by pre-treatment with flumazenil, L-arginine or sildenafil. However, L-NAME or methylene blue (MB) augmented its effect.
3:::The results showed that simvastatin ameliorated the memory deficits both in clinical AD patients and animal model of AD. Simvastatin could reduce the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines and mediators, suppress the apoptosis of neural stem cells and improve the survival rate of neurons. Moreover, long non-coding RNA (lnc RNA) n336694 and miR-106b was overexpressed in APP/PS1 mice brain tissues, the relationship between lnc RNA n336694 and miR-106b was explored using the method of Target Scan bioinformatics predictions, the results revealed that miR-106b might be a potential target of lnc RNA n336694. Furthermore, miR-106b mediated apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cell and simvastatin could suppressed this process.
3:::Overall students were satisfied with their clinical learning experience across all placement areas. This was linked to the 6 constructs of the clinical learning environment inventory; personalization, innovation, individualization, task orientation, involvement, satisfaction. Significant differences in student experience were noted between age groups and student year but there was no difference noted between placement type, age and gender.
3:::According to the CDC/AAP case definition, 49.5% of participants had periodontitis and 9.1% had severe periodontitis. Periodontitis prevalence and severity increased with age. The extent of BL and PD ≥ 4 mm also increased with age, but more rapidly and to a greater extent for BL. The prevalence of periodontitis was higher among men and varied between urban and rural areas. Periodontitis prevalence was positively associated with smoking, lower levels of education and income.
3:::At the pre-implantation stage the majority of participants in all three groups considered the human embryo as ""not a human being"". Also, at the post-implantation stage of development, the majority of infertile couples and clinic staff considered the embryo as ""not a human being"" but, half the researchers (51%) considered the embryo in this stage as a ""potential human"". Half of the infertile couples considered the human fetus before ensoulment time (19(th) week of pregnancy according to the Shiite Islamic scholars) as ""not-human being"", while more than half of researchers (55.1%) considered it as a ""potential human"".
3:::Out of a total number of 500 respondents, 187 (37.4%) had heard about osteoporosis, however, only 34 (18.2%) of those who have heard about osteoporosis knew the correct meaning of osteoporosis. Overall, only 34 (6.8%) out of 500 knew the correct meaning of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis awareness was highest among age group ≥51 years (33.3%) and least in age group ≤20 years (6.3%) (p = 0.006). Awareness was also highest among civil servants (17.9%) and least among unemployed respondents (0.0%) (p < 0.001). There was no gender preponderance in awareness level while marital status and level of education were not significantly associated with level of awareness.
3:::RMSE was lowest in the following reconstruction conditions: SI of 100 and 3DGF of 13 mm for Brightview XCT, SI of 160 and 3DGF of 3 pixels for Discovery NM/CT, SI of 60 and 3DGF of 2 pixels for Infinia, and SI of 140 and 3DGF of 15 mm for Symbia. In pre-harmonized conditions, coefficient of variations (COVs) among the SPECT/CT systems were greater than 10% for all quantitative metrics in three of the spheres, SUVmax and SUVmean, in one of the spheres. In contrast, all metrics except SUVmax in the 17-mm sphere yielded less than 10% of COVs after harmonization.
3:::B1-inhomogeneity resulted in -23-5% fluctuations (95% confidence interval [CI] of % error) of FA. The 95% CIs of FA-dependent % errors in the gray matter and blood were as follows: -16.7-61.8% and -16.7-61.8% for the pre-contrast R1, -1.0-0.3% and -5.2-1.3% for the contrast-enhancement ratio, and -14.2-58.1% and -14.1-57.8% for the Gd-concentration, respectively. These resulted in -43.1-48.4% error for K(trans), -32.3-48.6% error for the ve, and -43.2-48.6% error for vp. The pre-contrast R1 was more vulnerable to FA error than the contrast-enhancement ratio, and was therefore a significant cause of the Gd-concentration error. For example, a -10% FA error led to a 23.6% deviation in the pre-contrast R1, -0.4% in the contrast-enhancement ratio, and 23.6% in the Gd-concentration. In a simulated condition with a 3% FA error in a target lesion and a -10% FA error in a feeding vessel, the % errors of the pharmacokinetic parameters were -23.7% for K(trans), -23.7% for ve, and -23.7% for vp.
3:::The response rate at 3-months was 41.2% (n=247): 93 participants reported 7-day abstinence (38%) and were mailed a saliva kit (71% returned). The discordance rate was 36.4%. Participants with discordant responses were more likely to report 3-month use of nicotine replacement therapy or e-cigarettes than those with concordant responses (79.2% vs. 45.2%, p=0.007). The total cost of saliva sampling was $8280 ($125/sample).
3:::Mean (SD) age was 76.2 (4.8) years; 58% were women. Cardiac calcification was highly prevalent in women and men: AVC, 59.5 and 71.0%; AAC 45.1 and 46.7%; MAC 42.8 and 39.5%, respectively. After limited and full adjustment for potential confounders, no statistically significant associations were detected between continuous BMD at either site and the three measures of calcification. Assessment of WHO BMD categories revealed a significant association between osteoporosis at the total hip and AVC in men (adjusted RR compared with normal BMD = 1.24 (1.01-1.53)). In graded sensitivity analyses, there were apparent inverse associations between femoral neck BMD and AVC with stenosis in men, and femoral neck BMD and moderate/severe MAC in women, but these were not significant.
3:::Conversely to lean subjects, TEE and AEE did not increase in overweight participants due to a spontaneous decrease in non-training AEE. Despite this compensatory behavior, aerobic fitness, insulin sensitivity and fat oxidation were improved by exercise training. The latter was not explained by changes in dietary fat trafficking but more likely by a coordinated response at the muscle level enhancing fat uptake, acylation and oxidation (FABPpm, CD36, FATP1, ACSL1, CPT1, mtGPAT). ACSL1 fold change positively correlated with total fasting (R(2)=0.59, P<0.0001) and postprandial (R(2)=0.49, P=0.0006) fat oxidation whereas mtGPAT fold change negatively correlated with dietary palmitate oxidation (R(2)=0.40, P=0.009), suggesting modified fat trafficking between oxidation and storage within the muscle. However, for most of the measured parameters the post-training values observed in overweight adults remained lower than the pre-training values observed in the lean subjects.
3:::By combining Ootanis method with the TMDU protocol, we established a refined culture method for Lewis rat colon organoids, which we refer to as the modified TMDU protocol. Furthermore, we confirmed that PGE2 and galection-4 promoted rat colonic organoid formation.'
3:::Postprandial glycaemic excursion was higher during the night shift (381±33 vs 580±48 mmol/l per 5 h, p<0.01). The time to peak insulin and C-peptide and nadir glucagon suppression in response to meal ingestion was also delayed during the night shift. While insulin action did not differ between study days, the beta cell responsivity to glucose (59±5 vs 44±4 × 10(-9) min(-1); p<0.001) and disposition index were decreased during the night shift.
3:::Irradiation (2 Gy) caused (i) non-recoverable CTA (≥ 64.7 ± 5.0%); (ii) degenerative changes in cerebral cortex, amygdala and hippocampus; (iii) increases in brain dopamine (DA, 63.4%), norepinephrine (NE, 157%), epinephrine (E, 233%), plasma NE (103%) and E (160%); and (iv) decreases in brain superoxide dismutase (67%), catalase (60%) and glutathione (51%). SBL-1 treatment (12 mg/kg body weight) 30 min before irradiation (i) countered brain injuries, (ii) reduced CTA (38.7 ± 3.0%, day 1) and (iii) normalized brain DA, NE, E, superoxide dismutase, catalase and CTA from day 3 onwards.
3:::In total, 70 healthcare professionals participated in the survey. Of participants, 84.3% found pharmacogenomics relevant to their current practice, but experience was still rare. More than two-thirds (65.7%) did not order nor recommend a pharmacogenomic test in the past year. This was mainly attributed to not having enough knowledge on pharmacogenomics (40.0%). Needs were identified in application of pharmacogenomics (identifying drugs 41.4%, interpreting test results 37.2%) as well as in underlining mechanisms (better knowledge on drug metabolism 67.1%, better knowledge on basic principles of pharmacogenomics 60.0%).
3:::Recruitment proved to be extremely difficult with only two patients recruited during the first two months. The pivotal issue in Center A was that an effective and established clinical service could not easily adapt to the needs of the RCT. There was little scope to present RCT details or ensure efficient eligibility assessment, and recruiters struggled to convey equipoise. Following presentation of QRI findings, recruitment in Center A increased from 9% in the first two months (2/22) to 40% (26/65) in the four months thereafter. Center B, commencing recruitment three months after Center A, learnt from the emerging issues in Center A and set up a special clinic for trial recruitment. The trial successfully completed pilot recruitment and progressed to the main phase across 11 centers.
3:::The algorithm is tested on 460 h of EEG from 19 patients of Freiburg dataset who had at least 3 seizures. Considering maximum Seizure Prediction Horizon of 42 minutes, average sensitivity was 91.8 - 96.6% and average false prediction rate was 0.05 - 0.08/h.
3:::The cohort of children was 48% non-Hispanic white, and 51% were boys. Twenty-one percent of children with ITSC scores ≥6 were obese at preschool age. Infants with ITSC scores ≥6 had 32% increased odds of being obese at preschool age (adjusted odds ratio 1.32 [95% confidence interval 1.03, 1.70]). The strongest association existed among children described as demanding attention constantly. There was no difference in the association when comparing mothers with high or low maternal sensitivity.
3:::Anxiety was reported to have been diagnosed at some time in 14.3% of the sample. The prevalence was higher in women than in men (77.8 vs. 22.2%), decreasing with age, and related to different chronic diseases.
3:::Our search strategy resulted in the identification of 126 articles. After the eligibility assessment, 45 papers met the inclusion criteria. Full clinical and neurophysiological data were further extracted and involved 92 patients with PPN (54.5% males, mean age 60.0 ± 12.2 years). The commonest first manifestation of PPN is sensory loss (67.4%), followed by pain (41.3%), weakness (22.8%), and sensory ataxia (20.7%). In 13.0% of the cases, pain was the sole first manifestation of the PPN. During the course of the PPN, 57.6% of the patients may experience pain secondary to the neuropathy.
3:::The results show an outstanding specificity when the EMD block is used, even in very noisy conditions (0.96 compared to 0.72 for SNR = 8 dB), being always superior than that of the conventional SM alone. Regarding the sensitivity, using the EMD method also outperforms in noisy conditions (0.57 compared to 0.46 for SNR=8 dB), while it decreases in noiseless conditions.
3:::As a proof of concept, some study cases were analyzed with the presented system achieving promising results. In addition to be used to quantify treatment effectiveness in patients with brain lesions, it was demonstrated that BRAIM is able to classify a subject according to the brain volume measurements using as reference a healthy control database created for this purpose.
3:::The manual did not show a statistical significant difference with rotary instrumentation (P > 0.05), but higher CHX substantivity was recorded in all periods of observation when compared to reciprocating instrumentation (P < 0.05).
3:::In total, 514 hand phenotypes were obtained, 384 of which could be classified in the OMT classification. A total of 1,403 diseases could be related to those CULA. A comparison with 10 recently published cases with CULA revealed that the presented phenotype matched the descriptions in our dataset. The differential diagnosis produced using our methodology was more accurate than Phenomizer in 4 of 5 examples.
3:::Mean scores (SD/SEM) for the contrast agents (n = 50) were iopamidol = 21.0 (8.4/1.2); iohexol = 21.8 (7.1/1.0); Gastrografin = 16.8 (9.6/1.4); and barium = 23.7 (9.1/1.3). One-way ANOVA equality of means test shows rejection of the hypothesis that the means are equal (F* = 6.550, p = .000). Post hoc testing demonstrates Gastrografin to be significantly less preferred to barium (p = .000) and iohexol (p = .012). No difference was found between iopamidol and iohexol (p = .959). One-way ANOVA equality of means test of just iopamidol, iohexol, and barium does not reject the hypothesis that means are equal (F* = 1.778 and p = .174).
3:::The results of our model have been compared with Chan-Vese model and manual annotations marked by physicians using F-measure and false positive rate. The value of average F-measure and FPR was 0.61 and 0.16 achieved through the Hue-texture-embedded region-based model. And the C-V model achieved the average F-measure and FPR value of 0.52 and 0.32, respectively. Experiments showed that the Hue-texture-embedded region-based outperforms Chan-Vese model in terms of efficiency, universality and lesion detection.
3:::Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (33%) and intracranial hemorrhage (27%) accounted for the etiology in more than half of preterm neonates. Hypothermia therapy was utilized in 15 moderate to late preterm subjects with encephalopathy. The presence of subclinical seizures, monotherapy treatment failure, and distribution of seizure burden (including status epilepticus) was similar in preterm and term neonates. However, exclusively subclinical seizures occurred more often in preterm than term neonates (24% vs 14%). Phenobarbital was the most common initial medication for all gestational age groups, and failure to respond to an initial loading dose was 63% in both preterm and term neonates. Mortality was similar among the three preterm gestational age groups; however, preterm mortality was more than twice that of term infants (35% vs 15%).
3:::No benefit of benazepril versus placebo was detected for renal survival time in all dogs; median (95% confidence interval (CI)) survival times were 305 (53-575) days in the benazepril group and 287 (152-not available) in the placebo group (P = .53). Renal survival times were not significantly longer with benazepril compared to placebo for subgroups: hazard ratios (95% CI) were 0.50 (0.21-1.22) with P = .12 for initial urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPC) >0.5, and 0.38 (0.12-1.19) with P = .080 for initial UPC >0.5 plus plasma creatinine ≤440 μmol/L. Proteinuria, assessed from the UPC, was significantly (P = .0032) lower after treatment with benazepril compared to placebo. There were no significant differences between groups for clinical signs or frequencies of adverse events.
3:::Several critical points in the process of data collection, preprocessing and analysis of cancer data were derived from the results, while a road-map for future population data studies was developed. In addition, increased morbidity rates were observed in the counties of Crete (Age Standardized Morbidity/Incidence Rates ASIR= 396.45 ± 2.89 and 274.77 ±2.48 for men and women, respectively) compared to European and world averages (ASIR= 281.6 and 207.3 for men and women in Europe and 203.8 and 165.1 in world level). Significant variation in cancer types between sexes and age groups (the ratio between deaths and reported cases for young patients, less than 34 years old, is at 0.055 when the respective ratio for patients over 75 years old is 0.366) was also observed.
3:::We found significant correlations between low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) Δ rest-6MWT with Δ oxyhemoglobin saturation by pulse oximetry (r=-0.64 and r=0.65, respectively; p<0.05), minute ventilation/carbon dioxide output relationship from beginning to peak exercise (r=-0.52 and r=0.53, p<0.05), and exercise ventilatory power (r=0.52 and r=-0.53, p<0.05). Interestingly, there was a strong positive correlation (r=0.82, p<0.05) between six-minute walk distance (6MWD) and Δ LF/HF from rest to exercise.
3:::At visit 1, patients with PAH showed impaired functional capacity (mean 6-min walk distance, 371 ± 131 m), increased PASP (mean, 54 ± 26 mm Hg), and borderline RVFWS (mean, 18 ± 6%). Patients before PAH therapy showed more pronounced reduction in 6-min walk distance (mean, 302 ± 136 m) and RVFWS (mean, 16 ± 5%). RVFWS at baseline was associated with PASP (R(2) = 0.25, P = .001), RV end-diastolic area (R(2) = 0.36, P < .001), and fractional area change (R(2) = 0.21, P < .001). Change in RVFWS was more strongly associated with ΔPASP (std β = -0.20, P = .02) than ΔPASP squared (std β = 0.11, P = .20). RVFWS showed strength over fractional area change for sequential RV assessment over a range of PASP changes.
3:::A total of 194 PPCM birth events were identified, for an incidence rate of 1/2418 births. Women with PPCM were older, often primiparous, and more likely to have multiple gestations, pre-existing DM, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Although the overall numbers were low, the incidence of PPCM was higher in pregnancies in women with pre-existing DM (1/613 birth events) and gestational DM (1/1751 birth events) vs those with neither (1/2550 birth events). Over a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, the mortality rate was higher in women affected by PPCM than in those who were not, with few deaths overall. Neonatal death was uncommon in the entire cohort but was numerically greater in the PPCM group.
3:::After 2 months of storage at ambient temperature, rice straw silages treated with additives were well-preserved, the pH values and butyric and acetic acid contents were lower, and the lactic acid content and lactic/acetic acid ratio were higher than those in the control (p<0.05). Acidity (pH) was lowest, and lactic acid highest, in 1821-treated silage (p<0.05). The NH3-N content decreased significantly in inoculant-treated silage (p<0.05) and the NH3-N content in 1821-treated silage was lowest among the treatments. The dry matter (DM) content of the control silage was lower than that of fresh rice straw (p<0.05), while that of the 1841- and p1174-inoculant-treated silages was significantly higher than that of HM/F-treated silage. Microbial additives did not have any significant (p>0.05) effect on acid detergent fiber or neutral detergent fiber contents. Crude protein (CP) content and in vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD) increased after inoculation of LAB 1821 (p<0.05).
3:::The MI scores differed significantly each month, except at the onset, between group A and group B (p<0.05). In both groups, we observed significant increases between onset and one month, between one month and two months, between two month and three months, and between three months and four months (p<0.05). However, there were no significant increases after four months (p>0.05). The degree of difference between months was as follows: onset ∼1 month, 1 month ∼2months, 2 months ∼3months, and 3 months ∼4months.
3:::BD-I patients displayed greater anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity during reward anticipation and higher BIS total scores compared to controls, with a positive relationship between the two measures. There were no neural or self-report group differences between relatives and controls.
3:::At the 8th week, no plaque and new blood vessel were observed in the control group. The ATV group showed more plaques and new blood vessels, and lower IMT, plaque thickness and area than the AS group. The PI and RI were significantly increased in the AS and ATV groups compared to the control group. PI, RI. Plaque EI and its ratio in plaque and arterial lumen of the ATV group were lower than those in the AS group. Compared with the control group, the AS and ATV groups had higher serum levels of TC, TG, LDL, MMP-3, MMP-9 and hs-CRP, and higher AI. However, compared with AS group, serum levels of TC, TG, LDL and AI fell in ATV group. In comparison of the AS group, serum levels of MMP-3, MMP-9 and hs-CRP, MPT, PA and PA/CVA, and the positive expressions of VEGF, FVIII-Rag, MMP-3, CD40L and F8 were significantly reduced in the ATV group. The AS and ATV groups showed a positive correlation of EI in the plaque and its ratio in the plaque and arterial lumen with F8 protein expression, MMP-3 and MMP-9.
3:::Comparative analysis revealed that the presence of active bleeding and the hemoperitoneum depth were significantly different between the surgery and conservative management groups and were confirmed as significant CT findings for predicting surgery, with adjusted odds ratio (ORs) of 3.773 and 1.318, respectively (p < 0.01). On the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis for hemoperitoneum depth, the optimal cut-off value was 5.8 cm with 73.7% sensitivity and 58.6% specificity (Az = 0.711, p = 0.004). In cases with a hemoperitoneum depth > 5.8 cm and concurrent active bleeding, the OR for surgery increased to 5.786.
3:::The sensitivity and precision of published sex or gender filters varied across topics. Sensitivity values ranged from 14.3% to 92.5%, while precision varied from 17.9% to 51.4%. These filters were less sensitive and less precise in their identification of relevant studies than has been reported in previous studies. Further, while the MEDLINE Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term ""Sex Factors"" achieved the greatest average precision (59.3%) of any individual filter term, the MEDLINE check tag ""Female"" returned the highest average sensitivity (90.1%), with an average precision of 25.0% across topics.
3:::Thirteen new families were diagnosed (three from Peru). Patients from three Brazilian families diagnosed previously were also reassessed. In total, 25 individuals (16 families) were evaluated. Mean (± SD) age at onset and disease duration were 34.8 ± 10.2 and 12 ± 8 years, respectively. Common findings were ataxia, dysarthria/dysphagia, nystagmus, pyramidal signs, ophthalmoparesis and seizures. No associations were found between clinical findings and geographical origins. Twelve patients living in remote regions were examined only once. In the remaining individuals, the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia score, and Neurological Examination Score for Spinocerebellar Ataxias worsened by 0.444 (95% CI, -0.088 to 0.800) and 0.287 (95% CI, -0.061 to 0.635) points/year, respectively. A common haplotype, 19CGGC14, was found in 11/13 of Brazilian and in 1/3 of Peruvian families.
3:::Seven hundred forty-three women underwent FP. Twenty-one percent (n = 154) were taking long-term CHC (≥6 months). AFC suppression was more likely with CHC use (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4, P = 0.011). The BREAK group (n = 79) stopped CHC for an average of 4 months. AFC improvement started at 1 month and plateaued at approximately 6- to 7-month break. The BREAK group had approximately twice as many oocytes per initial AFC as NO BREAK (2.8 ± 3.8 vs. 1.4 ± 0.9, P < 0.001).
3:::We identified twenty necessity-based argumentation types. Seven are only used to argue in favour of coverage, five solely for arguing against coverage, and eight are used to argue both ways. A positive decision appears to be facilitated when patients or the public set the decision on the agenda. Moreover, half the argumentation types are only used by patients, authors, the public and the media, whereas the other half is also used by policy makers and insurance companies. The latter group is more accepted and used in more different countries.
3:::Random spot check comparisons were performed 134 times on 27 unique patients, and daily SOFA score comparisons were performed for 215 patients over a total of 1206 patient days. Agreement between automatically scored and manually scored SOFA components for both random spot checks (696 pairs, κ=0.89) and daily calculation (5972 pairs, κ=0.89) was high. The most common discrepancies were in the respiratory component (inaccurate fraction of inspired oxygen retrieval; 200/1206) and creatinine (normal creatinine in patients with no urine output on dialysis; 128/1094). 147 patients were at risk of developing sepsis after intensive care unit admission, 10 later developed sepsis confirmed by chart review. All were identified before onset of sepsis with the ΔSOFA≥2 point criterion and 46 patients were false-positives.
3:::The values of attenuation parameters and volume on inspiratory and expiratory quantitative computed tomography (QCT) were significantly different between males and females (p < 0.001). The MLA and the 15th percentile value on inspiratory QCT were significantly lower in the ever-smoker group than in the never-smoker group (p < 0.05). On expiratory QCT, all lung attenuation parameters were significantly different according to the age range (p < 0.05). Pi10 in ever-smokers was significantly correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (r = -0.455, p = 0.003). In simple and multivariate regression analyses, TLCCT, FRCCT, and age showed significant associations with lung attenuation (p < 0.05), and only TLCCT was significantly associated with inspiratory Pi10.
3:::In the in-vitro analysis, the mean air kerma (AK) and dose area product (DAP)/frame were significantly lower with added copper filtration (protocols 3 and 4). In the in-vivo bilateral paired injections, AK and DAP/frame were significantly lower with filtration, without significant difference in image quality. The patient cohort groups with added filtration (protocols 3 and 4) showed significant reduction of total AK and DAP/patient without compromise to the image quality. Variations in focal spot size showed no significant differences in radiation dose and image quality.
3:::Fifty-three publications representing 32 unique web-based interventions were included. Over half of the interventions were targeted at dementia caregivers, with the rest targeting caregivers to the stroke, cancer, diabetes and general frailty populations. Studies used theory across the intervention trajectory. Interventions aimed to improve a range of health outcomes for caregivers through static and interactive delivery methods Caregivers were satisfied with the usability and accessibility of the websites but usage was generally low and declined over time. Depression and caregiver burden were the most common outcomes evaluated. The interventions ranged in their impact on health and social outcomes but reductions in perception of caregiver burden were consistently observed.
3:::After implementing the multifaceted intervention including e-alert and SRT, cases were identified with less severe clinical and laboratory abnormalities and the processes of care improved. When adjusted to propensity score, the interventions were associated with reduction in hospital mortality [for intervention phase II compared to pre-intervention: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.85, p = 0.003], reduction in the need for mechanical ventilation (aOR 0.45, 95% CI 0.37-0.55, p < 0.0001) and reduction in ICU LOS and hospital LOS for all patients as well as ICU LOS for survivors.
3:::Hemodynamic, respiratory, and laboratory data were collected. The median pH value at CRRT initiation was 7.14 [7.12, 7.15] in group 20 and 7.13 [7.09, 7.14] in group 40 (P = ns). The median baseline PaCO2 was 74 [72, 81] mmHg in group 20 vs. 79 [63, 85] mmHg in group 40 (P = ns). After 3 h of CRRT, the pH value was 7.05 [6.95, 7.09] in group 20 and 7.12 [7.1, 7.14] in group 40 (P < 0.05), with corresponding values of PaCO2 of 85 [79, 88] mmHg vs. 81 [63, 100] mmHg (P = ns). The difference in pH after 3 h was due to a metabolic component [standard base excess -10.4 [-12.5, -9.5] mEq/L in group 20 vs. -7.6 [-9.2, -5.1] mEq/L in group 40) (P < 0.05)]. Despite the increased infusion of bicarbonate in group 40, the blood CO2 content did not change during the experiment. The 12-h survival rate was higher in group 40 (67% vs. 0, P = 0.032).
3:::Fifty-one respondents had used the CPOE system and the PBOE system. Overall, satisfaction was higher with PBOE than CPOE (odds ratio (OR)=3.74; p<0.001). Usability (OR=4.00; p<0.001), reliability (OR=8.54; p<0.001), time consumption (OR=0.50; p<0.05 - survey statement was formulated negatively), and communication with nurses (OR=14.27; p<0.0001) reached statistically better agreement. The more experience with CPOE the more residents were disillusioned with the reliability (OR=6.55; p<0.01), the usability (OR=5.68; p<0.01) and the patient safety (OR=0.27; p<0.05 - survey statement was formulated negatively) of CPOE. Although safety issues were reported for both systems, the causes were different; PBOE imposed frequent rewriting of the order while CPOE lack of usability might be unsafe. Another important issue with both POE systems was time consumption.
3:::The model includes over two-hundred ""for"", ""against"" and ""neutral"" arguments that are selectively triggered depending on the input value of more than forty patient-state variables. We share the methodology followed for the development process and the initial validation results, that achieved a high ratio of 61/65 agreements with the consensus diagnosis, having a kappa value of K=0.86 for overall agreement and K=0.80 for first-ranked agreement.
3:::One hundred and fifty one patients were selected, including chronic migraine (n°47), migraine without aura (n° 92) and migraine with aura (n° 12) sufferers. Allodynia was reported in the 96,6% and pericranial tenderness was observed in the 68.8% of patients. Pericranial tenderness was more severe in patients with more frequent migraine and shorter sleep duration. Allodynia seemed associated with anxiety, pain catastrophizing and high disability scores. Comorbidity for JFM was present in the 0.03% ofpatients. These children presented with a severe depression and a significant reduction of quality of life as compared to the other patients.
3:::Within the past year, 61.0% of the online health information seekers and 61.1% of the offline health information seekers had searched on behalf of someone else. Independent of the information channel, surrogate seekers primarily searched for health information for family members (online: 89.8%; offline: 92.8%); they were significantly less likely to search for information on behalf of someone with whom they had weaker ties, such as colleagues (online: 25.1%; offline: 24.4%). In a multilevel generalized linear model, living together with someone was by far the most relevant determinant for surrogate seeking, with differences between countries or Internet activity being less important.
3:::The two patient groups demographic and clinical characteristics were similar (P > 0.05). Progression-free survival was significantly more pronounced in the HIPEC (25.1 months) patients compared to the control group (20 months) (P = 0.024) and there was a decreased risk of disease progression accorded to the patients treated with HIPEC (HR 2.1028; 95% CI 1.2941-3.4167; P = 0.0027). However, we did not discern any HIPEC related overall survival advantages (P = 0.29).'
3:::The mean FOM (all lesions, 0.984; lesions ≤ 3 mm, 0.980) and sensitivity ([reader 1: all lesions, 97.3%; lesions ≤ 3 mm, 96.2%], [reader 2: all lesions, 97.0%; lesions ≤ 3 mm, 95.8%]) of MIP iMSDE-TSE was comparable to the mean FOM (0.985, 0.977) and sensitivity ([reader 1: 96.7, 99.0%], [reader 2: 97, 95.3%]) of non-MIP iMSDE-TSE, but they were superior to those of non-MIP and MIP 3D-GREs (all, p < 0.001). The reading time of MIP iMSDE-TSE (reader 1: 47.7 ± 35.9 seconds; reader 2: 44.7 ± 23.6 seconds) was significantly shorter than that of non-MIP iMSDE-TSE (reader 1: 78.8 ± 43.7 seconds, p = 0.01; reader 2: 82.9 ± 39.9 seconds, p < 0.001). Interobserver agreement was excellent (κ > 0.75) for all lesions in both sequences.
3:::There were more negative tweets about the school meals policy than positive ones (16.8% vs. 12.9%), in addition to neutral tweets (70.3%). The main targets for negative opinions were campaign and food, and those for positive opinions were policy and health benefits. The opinion holders represent a wide range of policy stakeholders. The first-hand source dominated the opinions. Statement accounted for the function of most opinions. Females (62.5%) were more involved than males (37.5%), and people in the South and the West regions (64.2%) engaged themselves more than people in the Northeast and the Midwest (35.8%) of the U.S.
3:::There was a significant difference in T2(*) reduction rates between the NLF and SLD groups (-0.2 ± 4.9% vs. 5.0 ± 6.9%, p = 0.002), and between the MLD and SLD groups (3.2 ± 6.0% vs. 5.0 ± 6.9%, p = 0.003). However, there was no significant difference in both the pre- and post-contrast T2(*) values among different liver function groups (p = 0.735 and 0.131, respectively). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve for using T2(*) reduction rates to differentiate the SLD group from the NLF group was 0.74 (95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.83).
3:::Of the 76,984 trauma patients who presented to KCH from 2011 to 2015, 49,126 (63.8%) were adults, and 8569 (17.4%) were admitted. The most common injury was to the head or spine, seen in 3712 patients (43.6%). The highest unadjusted hazard ratio for mortality was in head and spine injury patients, at 3.685 (95% CI=2.50-5.44), which increased to 4.501 (95% CI=2.78-7.30) when adjusted for age, sex, injury severity, transfer status, injury mechanism, and surgical intervention. Abdominal trauma had the second highest adjusted hazard of mortality, at 3.62 (95% CI=1.92-6.84) followed by thoracic trauma (HR=1.3621, 95% CI=0.49-3.56).
3:::Addition of bza to E2-treatment totally antagonized the E2-mediated proliferative effect on uterus. On the contrary, addition of bza to E2-treatment did not block the E2-induced thymic atrophy or inhibition of B lymphopoiesis, and did not block the E2-induced increase in immunoglobulin secretion from bone marrow B cells.
3:::Abluminal but not luminal αCGRP (10(-12)-10(-6) M) caused concentration-dependent vasorelaxation in rat MCA. Luminal telcagepant (10(-6) M) failed to inhibit this relaxation, while abluminal telcagepant inhibited the relaxation (10(-6) M). Using the FURA-2 method in combination with wire myography we observed that αCGRP reduced intracellular calcium levels and in parallel the vascular tone. Telcagepant (10(-6) M) inhibited both vasorelaxation and drop in intracellular calcium levels. Both functional components of the CGRP receptor, CLR (calcitonin receptor-like receptor) and RAMP1 (receptor activity modifying peptide 1) were found in the smooth muscle cells but not in the endothelial cells of the cerebral vasculature.
3:::The LV myocardial thickness (SWT, 1.08 ± 0.18 cm vs. 0.90 ± 0.17 cm, p < 0.001; PWT, 0.91 ± 0.15 cm vs. 0.78 ± 0.10 cm, p < 0.001; RWT, 0.38 ± 0.08 cm vs. 0.33 ± 0.05 cm, p < 0.001), LV volume (LV end-diastolic volume, 112.9 ± 26.1 mL vs. 98.2 ± 21.0 mL, p < 0.001; LV end-systolic volume, 41.7 ± 14.7 mL vs. 33.7 ± 12.2 mL, p = 0.001) and mass (145.0 ± 29.1 g vs. 107.9 ± 20.0 g, p < 0.001) were significantly greater in men than in women. However, these differences were not significant after normalization using BSA, except for the LV mass (LV mass index, 79.6 ± 14.0 g/m(2) vs. 66.2 ± 11.0 g/m(2), p < 0.001). The cardiac output and ejection fraction were not significantly different between the men and women (cardiac output, 4.3 ± 1.0 L/min vs. 4.2 ± 0.9 L/min, p = 0.452; ejection fraction, 63.4 ± 7.7% vs. 66.4 ± 7.6%, p = 0.079). Most of the LV parameters were positively correlated with BSA, body weight, and total Agatston score.
3:::In 41 samples, EBNA1 was detected in 65.8% of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma which was significantly higher in younger ages.
3:::The mean ALT change at 12 weeks was -10.3 ± 11.7 and -3.2 ± 17.6 U/L in the canagliflozin vs. placebo group in the high ALT subgroup (P = 0.0206); no significant difference was shown in the low ALT subgroup (Study 1). In both ALT subgroups, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight were significantly reduced in the canagliflozin vs. placebo group (all P < 0.0001). The mean change in ALT at 52 weeks was -16.0 ± 18.8 U/L in the high ALT subgroup (P < 0.0001, Study 2). The incidence of AEs or serious AEs in the high ALT subgroup in the canagliflozin group was similar to that in the placebo group (Study 1) or low ALT subgroup (Studies 1 and 2).
3:::S3 stimulation required a lower amount of charges to trigger an action potential. Chronically applied S2 & S3 activated the dorsal vagal complex and increased the metabolism of its afferent cortical structures. They also reduced energy intake together with a reduced ingestion of high fat and high sugar diets. All these effects were not observed for the S1 group. The vagal histology for the S1, S2 and S3 groups was not different from that of the sham.
3:::Adherence to training was 84%. Performance on the BOT-2 was below average for all assessments. However, training resulted in improvement in bilateral coordination (F (1, 30) = 6.59, p = 0.02), irrespective of training setting and improved performance was maintained even approximately 12°weeks after training had ended (F (1, 24) = 9.60, p = 0.005). Training resulted in increased pro-rated work rate for participants in the group training setting only (F (1, 25) = 4.57, p = 0.04) and these participants maintained their improved work rate approximately 12°weeks after training had ended (F (1, 20) = 8.38, p = 0.01).
3:::Ki-67 was performed on both the primary tumor and metastases in 103 patients. Tumor grade was higher in metastases from 25 (24%) patients, 24 increased from G1 to G2, and 1 increased from G2 to G3; 68 (66%) patients had no change in grade (42 G1 and 26 G2), and 10 (10%) decreased from G2 to G1. No clinicopathologic factors were predictive of higher grade in metastases. The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 55% for patients with stable grade versus 8% of patients with increased grade, while 5-year overall survival (OS) was 92 and 54%, respectively. The 5-year OS of patients who had stable grade with G1 and G2 primaries was 92 and 64%, respectively.
3:::For 1000 individuals invited to screening, it was estimated that screening once with colonoscopy yielded 49 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and a cost saving of €64 800 compared with no screening. Similarly, screening twice with FIT gave 26 more QALYs and a cost saving of €17 600. When the colonoscopic screening was repeated every tenth year, 7 additional QALYs were gained at a cost of €189 400 compared with a single colonoscopy. The additional gain with biennial FIT screening was 25 QALYs at a cost of €154 300 compared with two FITs.
3:::Growing performance was higher (p<0.05) in the CON group compared to the TMR group during fattening and finishing periods. The CON group was lower (p<0.05) in blood aspartic acid transaminase, blood urea nitrogen and retinol levels during growing period, but higher in triglyceride and cholesterol levels during fattening and finishing periods compared to the TMR group. The CON group was greater (p<0.05) in rib-eye area, and lighter (p<0.05) red in meat color compared to the TMR group. In the correlation coefficients between blood components of steers and carcass traits, retinol had a negative (p<0.05) correlation with marbling score and rib-eye area. Leptin had a positive (p<0.05) correlation with back fat thickness. Blood cholesterol and triglyceride were positively (p<0.05) correlated with carcass weight and rib-eye area.
3:::Among 72 mice successfully acquired post-SAH MR images, 29 (40%) developed acute infarction. Location of the infarcts was classified into either single infarct (ipsilateral cortex, n=12; caudate putamen, n=3; hippocampus, n=1) or multiple lesions (cortex and caudate putamen, n=6; cortex and hippocampus, n=2; cortex, hippocampus and thalamus/hypothalamus, n=3; bilateral cortex, n=2). The mortality rate within 24h was significantly higher in mice with multiple infarcts than those with single lesion (30% versus 0%; P=0.03). Distribution of the ischemic lesion positively correlated with MRI-evidenced SAH grading (r(2)=0.31, P=0.0002).
3:::A modified 3-factor solution (i.e., fears=11 items, help-seeking=6 items, and symptom effects=4 items) provided the best fit to the data (χ(2) (364, N=602)=681.7, p<0.001; χ(2)/df=1.803; RMSEA=0.037; CFI=0.926). The factor structure was stable, well-fitting, and indicated measurement invariance across groups. DIF analyses revealed no gender-based response bias at the scale level.
3:::Of the 69 patients, 46 received enzalutamide first, followed by abiraterone (E-A group), and 23 received abiraterone, followed by enzalutamide (A-E group). The two groups were not significantly different with regard to basic data, except for hemoglobin values. In a comparison with the E-A group, the A-E group was shown to be associated with better combined PFS in Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = 0.043). Similar results were obtained for total PSA-PFS (P = 0.049), while OS did not differ between groups (P = 0.62). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values and age were significant predictors of longer combined PFS (P < 0.05). Likewise, multivariate analysis demonstrated that pretreatment hemoglobin values and performance status were significant predictors of longer OS (P < 0.05).
3:::The participants were generally physically active, and most participants in both groups met the public recommendation of PA for health promotion. Electrical pain ratings were significantly reduced during and after exposure to pressure pain compared to baseline. There was no racial/ethnic difference in a magnitude of changes in electrical pain ratings.
3:::Data showed an insignificant decrease of tumor growth after iv and ip treatment with low doses of BTB14431 and emodin. Differential blood analysis showed apoptosis. Increased doses of emodin clearly raised mortality rate.
3:::MHD was associated with current (RRRs ranging from 1.84 [1.50 to 2.26] to 4.31 [2.47 to 7.53]) and former (RRRs ranging from 1.26 [1.05 to 1.52] to 1.99 [1.19 to 3.33]) smoking and also associated with the presence of smoking-related disease (ORs ranging from 1.24 [1.01 to 1.51] to 1.62 [1.00 to 2.62]). Smoking did not mediate and rarely moderated associations between MHD and smoking-related disease.
3:::We found that 21% of the volunteers were anaemic. In 85 anaemic volunteers, they were classified as Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA); with low serum ferritin levels 42.4%, Thalassemia; total of 6 types 25.9%, IDA and Thalassemia 2.3% and Others 29.4% in which haemoglobin typing and serum ferritin level were normal.
3:::Increases in physical symptom burden predicted greater healthcare utilization one year after deployment: primary care practitioner (slope=-0.26, F=4.07, p=0.04), specialist (slope=-0.43, F=8.67, p=0.003), allied health therapy (e.g., physical therapy) (slope=-0.41, F=5.71, p=0.02) and mental health (slope=-0.32, F=4.04, p=0.05). There were no significant difference in utilization between those with consistently high levels and those with increases in physical symptom burden.
3:::Childhood adversity was robustly associated with schizophrenia. No main genetic effects were observed. MTHFR C677T increased schizophrenia risk in a dose-dependent manner per MTHFR T allele (P = 0.005) consequent upon CA exposure. After inclusion of the significant (P = 0.03) COMT × MTHFR × CA interaction, the risk was further increased per high-activity COMT Val allele. Hence, exposed COMT Val/Val and MTHFR T/T carriers had an IRR of 2.76 (95% CI, 1.66-4.61). Additional adjustments for ancestry and parental history of mental illness attenuated the results with the interaction being only marginally significant.
3:::Treatment engagement, two measures of psychotherapy receipt, and psychosocial treatment were significantly associated with perceived improvement, whereas treatment initiation and follow-up after hospitalization (seven and 30 days) were not. Psychotherapy receipt and follow-up after hospitalization (seven and 30 days) were significantly associated with global rating of behavioral health care.
3:::Among the two hundred persons who had ever been prescribed buprenorphine (73.4% male, 89% heroin users), 50.5% reported they had shared buprenorphine and 28.0% reported they had sold buprenorphine. Controlling for other covariates, the odds of sharing buprenorphine were 3.17 (95% CI 1.21; 8.32) times higher for persons who agreed that it was ""right to share buprenorphine with dope sick friends"" than for those who did not agree with this attitude. Attitudes toward selling (OR 2.92; 95% CI 1.35; 6.21) and sharing (OR 4.12; 95% CI 1.64; 10.32) buprenorphine were the only significant correlates of selling, with the odds of selling exponentially greater among persons with favorable attitudes toward sharing or selling buprenorphine.
3:::Three broad themes, with seven sub-themes, were identified: (i) the reason for accessing online counselling (seeking advice, wanting to talk), (ii) discussing help-seeking and coping processes (past/present help-seeking or coping strategies, barriers and facilitators to seeking help and change), and (iii) planning for future assistance (future planning, treatment preferences).
3:::About 19% of patients (n = 67) showed positive Dallas criteria and 39% (n = 118) immunohistochemical signs of inflammation. Viral genome was present in 58% (n = 155). During follow-up, 25% (n = 89; 76 death, 13 HTx) reached the end point. Dallas-positive histopathology (hazard ratio: 0·42; 95% CI: 0·29-0·84, P = 0·031), ejection fraction (hazard ratio: 0·97; 95% CI: 0·94-0·99, P = 0·019) and β-blocker therapy (hazard ratio: 0·41; 95% CI: 0·23-0·69, P = 0·003) were independent outcome predictors. For patients under β-blocker therapy, Dallas-positive histopathology (hazard ratio: 0·37; 95% CI: 0·25-0·76, P = 0·009) and NYHA class III and class IV (hazard ratio: 2·11; 95% CI: 1·04-3·12, P = 0·006) were independent predictors.
3:::Data from 178 CPPS patients (60.1% female; age M=49.1, SD=18.0) were analyzed. Of the total sample, 95.2% (95% CI 90.8-97.9) suffered from at least one mental disorder. The most prevalent mental disorders were somatoform disorders (91.7%; 95% CI 86.4-95.4), followed by mood disorders (50.6%; 95% CI 42.8-58.4) and anxiety disorders (32.1%; 95% CI 25.2-39.8). The self-reported symptom burden was also significantly higher than in the general population. Compared to men, women met the diagnoses of somatoform (p=0.012) and anxiety disorders (p=0.027) significantly more often and reported a significantly higher total somatic symptom severity (p=0.001).
3:::The proportion of Bangladeshis scoring low on the knowledge assessment was 0.53, where as the proportion of whites scoring low in the CARDIA study was 0.32 (p value < .001). Whites were 34% more likely to score high than Bangladeshis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-1.52). Bangladeshis were more likely to mention diet and cholesterol as risk factors and less likely to mention lack of exercise, being overweight, and smoking as risk factors.
3:::Receipt of a follow-up visit within 30 days of discharge was associated with a slightly lower adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of hospital readmission during days 31-120 postdischarge (schizophrenia, AOR=.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.81-.96; bipolar disorder, AOR=.91, CI=.85-.98). For patients with schizophrenia, the strongest observed inverse association of follow-up care with readmission risk was among inpatients whose index admissions were 13 to 30 days long (AOR=.73, CI=.61-.89). For patients with bipolar disorder, the strongest corresponding inverse association was among those in the manic phase of illness at the index discharge (AOR=.73, CI=.63-.86).
3:::The sample was 56% male; mean age=25. Reported risk behaviors and health consequences did not differ by assessment modality. Adjusted HLM analyses showed a significant main effect of assigned condition on all outcomes. CAPI participants had greater reductions in drug use, risky sex, mental distress and substance dependence symptoms, and greater increases in abstinence, compared to ACASI intervention or control participants at 12months, except that the CAPI and ACASI conditions had similar efficacy for reductions in drug use. Effect sizes for CAPI versus ACASI participants were d=0.2-0.3, and between CAPI and controls d=0.2-0.4. Effect sizes for improved outcomes between ACASI compared to controls were small to non-significant.
3:::PMP prevalence varied from 21.2% to 27.7% and from 48.5% to 58.0% in pediatric and adult Medicaid-insured patients, respectively. Among pediatric patients who started PMP (N=397,728), the proportion who had received psychotherapy before PMP varied from 21.0% in the 1999-2000 cohort to 40.0% in 2005-2007. After PMP initiation, psychotherapy prevalence was higher, with estimates ranging from 25.4% in 1999-2000 to 44.1% in 2005-2007. Among adults (N=773,205), the prevalence of psychotherapy after PMP initiation ranged from 12.6% in 1999-2001 to 19.25% in 2003-2005. Psychotherapy prevalence prior to PMP initiation varied greatly across states.
3:::Overall 2101 PLWH with unhealthy drinking (10/01/09-5/30/13) had repeat alcohol screens 9-15months later. Of those, 77% had brief intervention documented after their first screen, and 61% resolved unhealthy alcohol use at follow-up. Documented brief intervention was not associated with resolution [Adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.96, (95% CI 0.90-1.02)].
3:::HFD caused a significant weight gain and increased liver TG content as well as alteration in ALT and AST activities, which were attenuated after administration of parthenoide (p < .05). Weakened liver antioxidant system (TAC, total thiol groups and catalase activity) and increased oxidative stress markers (TBARs and TOS) were mainly ameliorated by parthenolide treatment (p < .05). Increased hepatic TNF-α, NF-κB and CYP2E1 at the both gene expression and protein levels were found associated with necroinflammatory changes in histopathological observations and were abrogated almost completely after parthenolide treatment. Oxidative and inflammatory changes observed in HFD fed rats were indicative of NAFLD, which were suppressed with parthenolide treatment.
3:::Compared to sham, blood leukocyte numbers increased after ovx and ovx+E2 6 h after LPS injections into the air pouch. LPS after ovx induced neutrophil infiltration into the pouch, accompanied by increased levels of MCP-1 and IL-6. Ovx+E2 further enhanced cell infiltration after LPS; however, the cell population diversified by also including more macrophages and monocytes, with reduced MCP-1 and IL-6 levels. Compared to ovx, blood leukocyte numbers increased already 1h after i.p challenge in ovx+E2 mice.
3:::Self-reported delusions were associated with violent ideation (odds ratio [OR]=3.08), damaging property (OR=8.24), and physical aggression (OR=12.39). Alcohol and cigarette cravings were associated with violent ideation (OR=5.20 and OR=6.08, respectively), damaging property (OR=3.71 and OR=4.26, respectively), threatening others (OR=3.62 and OR=3.04, respectively), and physical aggression (OR=6.26, and OR=8.02, respectively). Drug cravings were associated with violent ideation (OR=2.76) and damaging property (OR=5.09). Decreased variability in physical activity and noisy ward conditions were associated with violent ideation (OR=.71 and OR=2.82, respectively).
3:::Shorter duration of breastfeeding was associated with a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) only (z score change, -0.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.02 to -0.00) per month shorter breastfeeding, but not asthma. When categorized, breastfeeding for 2 to 4 months was associated with a lower forced vital capacity (FVC) (z score change, -0.11; 95% CI, -0.20 to -0.03) compared with breastfeeding for 6 months or longer. Nonexclusive breastfeeding for 4 months was associated with a lower FVC (z score change, -0.08; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.01) compared with exclusive breastfeeding for 4 months. Results did not materially change after additional adjustment for lower respiratory tract infections and were not modified by maternal history of asthma or atopy, childs eczema, or inhalant allergic sensitization.'
3:::The system did not require complex training. Mutational status was obtained in few hours after making the histological diagnosis and on the day of the patients sampling by analyzing fresh material. The sequential testing strategy avoided 15 EGFR and 15 KRAS tests that would have been negative. Compared with reference methods, global specificity and sensitivity were both 100% for EGFR mutations, and 89.1% and 91.7% for KRAS mutations, respectively.'
3:::Behavioral results showed that identification of the felt emotion as well as perceived intensity varies by emotion, but no significant group effect was found. Pupil measurements revealed differences in dilation depending on the emotion evoked by the film clips (happy, tender, sadness, fear, and neutral) for both groups.
3:::The most common location of the lesion was urinary bladder (14 patients) followed by renal pelvis (2 patients), ureter (1 patient) and urethra (1 patient). A history of urothelial carcinoma and repeated TUR procedures were observed in 12 patients. There were 2 pediatric patients aged 3 years. Both of them had undergone previous urosurgery because of megaureter in one and bladder exstrophy in the other. Other clinical antecedents included bladder diverticulum (1 patient), cystitis (1 patient) and nephrolithiasis (1 patient). Recurrence of lesion was seen in two patients (once in one case and twice in the other one). The median time to disease recurrence in these patients was 11 months (range, 2-20 months). Histologically, the lesions exhibited various morphological findings, with mixed (15 cases, 71.4%), pure tubular (3 cases, 14.3%), pure papillary (2 cases, 9.5%) and pure flat (1 case, 4.8%) growth patterns. Of the 15 cases with mixed patterns, 8 cases were tubulocystic and flat, 3 cases were tubular and flat, 2 cases were tubular, papillary and flat, 1 case was tubulocystic, papillary and flat, and 1 case was tubular and papillary. Flat pattern was observed in 15 cases (71.4%). It was seen in association with other patterns in 14 cases (mixed morphology) and purely in 1 case. Our findings suggested that the flat pattern is a frequent finding in nephrogenic adenomas. Notably one case in this series showed superficial extension into bladder muscularis propria.
3:::Thirty-four of the 44 infants with colic (77%) scored as atypical for sensory processing. Of these, 56% scored atypical for sensory processing on quadrant one (Q1) (Low Registration), with 24%, 65%, and 18% scoring as atypical for sensory processing on Q2 (Sensory seeking), Q3 (Sensory sensitivity), and Q4 (Sensation avoiding), respectively. All infants demonstrating sensation avoiding also scored as Low Threshold. A moderate statistically significant correlation was found between sensation seeking and time spent sleeping (r=0.31; p=0.04). No other statistically significant associations between infant behaviors and their sensory functioning were demonstrated. Overall, infants demonstrating atypical sensory responses (in any quadrant) slept significantly more than infants demonstrating typical sensory responses (mean difference=-67.8min/day; 95% CI=-133.6 to -2.1; p=0.04).
3:::Of 66 patients, 85% (95% confidence intervals 74-93%) had HTPR. Compared to baseline infusion of 100 mg, ASA significantly reduced platelet aggregation after 24 h to median 80% (Quartiles: 66-84%). Intake of 81 mg chewable ASA significantly reduced platelet aggregation to 75% (54-86%) after four hours, but increased it to 117% after 24 h (81-163%). Treatment with 100 mg enteric-coated ASA bid decreased platelet aggregation after 24 h to median 56% (52-113%). Baseline TXB2 levels were median 0·35 ng/mL (0·07-0·94). Infusion of ASA or intake of 100 mg ASA bid reduced TXB2 levels to 0·07-0·18 ng/mL after 24 h, respectively. Chewable ASA reduced TXB2 levels only transiently. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed highly variable absorption patterns of oral ASA formulations.
3:::Overall, participants endorsed the accreditation program but identified several areas of concern. Noted strengths of the program included: program ownership, peer review and collaborative learning; access to Practice Incentives Program payments; and, improvements in safety and quality. Noted limitations in these and other aspects of the program offer potential for improvement: evidence for the impact of accreditation; resource demands; clearer outcome measures; and, specific experiences of accreditation.
3:::Stress was not related to body mass index (BMI) for African American or White women, but chronic stress was associated with higher BMI for Caribbean Black women. Stress was associated with depressive symptoms, but there was variation by the type of stressor under consideration. Physical activity was associated with fewer depressive symptoms and lower BMI, but the relationships varied by type of stressor and race/ethnicity. Physical activity moderated the effect of chronic stress on depressive symptoms and BMI, but only for African American women who reported high levels of chronic stress. Among White women, physical activity moderated the effect of racial discrimination on BMI for those who reported experiencing both high and low levels of discrimination.
3:::Eighty patients responded to the questionnaire (89%). Negative effects to different extent (from slightly agree' to 'fully agree') were reported by 25 (31%). The most frequent negative effects were dependence on the therapist (12%), feeling down after therapy (6%) and insurance problems (7%). By exploring 27 participants' experiences of negative effects 3 main themes were identified: relations in therapy, outcome and transition from therapy to everyday life.'
3:::80.8% of 567 191 pregnant women were screened for GDM. Most of them (63.3%) received only the pre-test, and 12.7% received both the pre-test and the diagnostic test. 4.8% received only the diagnostic test. The overall prevalence of GDM was 13.2%. The prevalence rose with age, from 8% to 26% in women aged 45 or older. Younger women more commonly received only the pre-test; the frequency of receiving both tests rose with age.
3:::Young peoples attitudes toward open communication between family members were more ambivalent and ambiguous than previous research suggests. Parental attempts at open communication were sometimes overlooked by young people, indicating that there may be differences between knowledge given and young people's acknowledgment of sensitive information. Some young people valued open communication as a signifier of the close relationships between family members, while others wanted to exercise more control over what they knew, when, and how. Young people's accounts challenged the positioning of young people as passive recipients of information. Young people were active in shaping family communication in their everyday lives, and deliberative acts of speaking or remaining silent were one way in which young people exercised care for themselves and others.'
3:::Twelve randomized controlled trials with a total of 2903 individuals were finally included into the meta-analysis. Incretin-based drugs could significantly reduce HbA1c (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.10), weight (MD -2.83, 95% CI -4.00 to -1.65) and insulin dose (MD -4.55, 95% CI -6.15 to -2.94). Furthermore, incretin-based drugs did not increase relative risk of severe hypoglycemia (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.06), ketosis (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.97) and ketoacidosis (RR 2.62, 95% CI 0.31 to 21.99).
3:::Among 105 currently recovered patients, lifetime anxiety disorder was significantly associated with 10/27 (37.0%) demographic/other unfavorable illness characteristics/current mood symptoms/current psychotropics, hastened depressive recurrence (driven by earlier onset age), and a significantly (> two-fold) higher Kaplan-Meier estimated depressive recurrence rate, whereas current anxiety symptoms were significantly associated with 10/27 (37.0%) demographic/other unfavorable illness characteristics/current mood symptoms/current psychotropics and hastened depressive recurrence (driven by lifetime anxiety disorder), but only a numerically higher Kaplan-Meier estimated depressive recurrence rate. In contrast, among 153 currently depressed patients, lifetime anxiety disorder/current anxiety symptoms were not significantly associated with time to depressive recovery or depressive recovery rate.
3:::CrTK is homodimeric and its catalysis depends on the reconstitution of the holo-enzyme in the presence of both TPP and Mg(2+). Activity measurements and CD analysis revealed that the formation of fully active holo-CrTK is Mg(2+)-dependent and proceeds with a slow kinetics. The 3D-structure of CrTK without cofactors (CrTKapo) shows that two portions of the active site are flexible and disordered while they adopt an ordered conformation in the holo-form. Oxidative treatments revealed that Mg(2+) participates in the redox control of CrTK by changing its propensity to be inactivated by oxidation. Indeed, the activity of holo-form is unaffected by oxidation whereas CrTK in the apo-form or reconstituted with the sole TPP show a strong sensitivity to oxidative inactivation.
3:::Of the 144 PWE (General population 71, Mild ID 48, Moderate to profound ID 48) examined the association between withdrawal and ID type was marginally statistically significant (p=0.07). Moderate to profound ID PWE were less likely to come off PER compared to mild ID (OR=0.19, CI=0.04-0.92, p=0.04). Differences in mental health side effects by groups was marginally statistically significant (p=0.06). Over 50% seizure improvement was seen in 11% of General population, 24% mild ID and 26% Moderate to profound ID.
3:::From the total 125 cases, 95 (76%) patients were male and 30 (24%) were female. The mean age was 59.5 ± 5.5 years. The mean operative time in SLC group was 128 ± 17 min VS. 114 ± 10 min in RI group. Conversion to open occurred in 10% in SLC group VS. 1.5% in RI group. Biliary injury occurred in 3.3% in SLC group VS. 0% in RI group. The mean hospital stay in SLC was 3.7 ± 5.3 days VS. 2.1 ± 0.3 days in RI group.
3:::Overall, 1,456 records (1,199 from electronic databases and 257 from other sources) were initially retrieved. After analyzing 172 full text articles, 38 papers describing fifteen disinvestment programs/experiences in eight countries were included. The majority (12/15) of disinvestment programs began after 2006. As expected, these programs were more common in developed countries, 63 percent of which had a Beveridge model healthcare system. The univariate analysis showed that countries with disinvestment programs had a significantly higher level of Human Development Index, Gross Domestic Product per capita, public expenditure on health and social services, life expectancy at birth and a lower level of infant mortality rate, and of perceived corruption. The existence of HTA agencies in the country was a strong predictor (p = .034) for the development of disinvestment programs.
3:::Apocynin significantly reduced serum AST, ALT, and ALP activities in carbon tetrachloride treated rats. It also exhibited a considerable reduction of the oxidative stress markers (MDA, MPO, NO, and APOP level) which was elevated due to CCl4 administration in rats. Apocynin treatment also restored the catalase and superoxide dismutase activity in CCl4 treated rats. Histological analysis of liver sections revealed that apocynin prevented inflammatory cells infiltration and fibrosis in CCl4 administered rats.
3:::In PD patients, compared to controls, preferential beta band information outflow was significantly higher for the basal ganglia and frontotemporal cortical regions, and significantly lower for parieto-occipital regions. In addition, in patients, low preferential information outflow from occipital regions correlated with poor global cognitive performance.
3:::At a median follow-up of 23.4 years, there were 2605 incident HF hospitalizations. Lp(a) levels were directly associated with incident HF hospitalization in models adjusted for age, race, gender, systolic blood pressure, history of hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, body mass index, heart rate, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (quintile 5 vs. quintile 1: hazard ratio [HR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-1.41; p-trend across increasing quintiles <0.01), but not after excluding prevalent and incident myocardial infarction cases (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91-1.27; p-trend = 0.70). When adjusted for age, gender, and race, Lp(a) quintiles were not significantly associated with arterial stiffness parameters.
3:::A total of 25 articles (on 22 RCTs) were eligible for this review. Beyond face-to-face counseling, telephone was the most frequently used medium for delivering MI (11 studies), followed by Internet communication (4 studies) and short message service (SMS) (2 studies). Mail was incorporated as a supplement in one of the studies for telephone MI. In contrast to one-to-one individual counseling, group MI was adopted in 5 studies. The effectiveness of telephone MI in treating substance abuse was supported by all of the published RCTs we located. Internet-based MI was effective in preventing and treating alcoholism, but its outcome appeared to be inconsistent for smoking cessation and poor for abstinence from illicit drugs. SMS-based MI appeared to be useful for controlling tobacco and drinking. Group MI was attempted for quitting alcohol and drugs, with mixed findings on its outcomes.
3:::On multivariate analysis, Malay adolescents were more likely to report marginally unfavorable attitude towards condom use (aPR 1.21 CI 1.00-1.48) and significantly lower confidence in using condoms correctly (aPR 1.24 CI 1.05-1.47) than Chinese adolescents. They were also more likely to report significantly younger first sex age (aPR 0.98 CI 0.96-1.00), never use of condoms for vaginal sex (aPR 1.32 CI 1.16-1.49) and anal sex (aPR 1.75 CI 1.11-2.76) and non-use of contraceptives at last sex (aPR 1.30 CI 1.17-1.45) than Chinese respondents. Malay males were less likely to buy sex (aPR 0.56 CI 0.37-0.85), but they reported higher likelihood of inconsistent condom use with female sex workers (aPR 2.24 CI 1.30-3.87).
3:::One hundred fifty children (mean BMI, 26.4; mean BMI z score, 2.0; mean age, 10.4 years; 66.4% girls) and their parent (mean BMI, 31.9; mean age, 42.9 years; 87.3% women; and 31% Hispanic, 49% non-Hispanic white, and 20% other race/ethnicity) were randomly assigned to either FBT or PBT. Child weight loss after 6 months was -0.25 BMI z scores in both PBT and FBT. Intention-to-treat analysis using mixed linear models showed that PBT was noninferior to FBT on all outcomes at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-up with a mean difference in child weight loss of 0.001 (95% CI, -0.06 to 0.06).
3:::The quality of bowel cleansing, evaluated using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS), was significantly higher in the smartphone app group than in the control group (7.70±1.1 vs. 7.24±0.8, respectively, p=0.007 by t-test). No significant differences were found between the two groups regarding work-up time and the number of patients with polyps.
3:::In 43 studies that examined cohorts of registry entries, 24 used automatic and manual processes to find articles; 3 only automatic; and 11 only manual (5 did not specify). Twelve studies reported results for both manual and automatic processes and showed that a median of 23% (range from 13 to 42%) included automatic links to articles, while 17% (range from 5 to 42%) of registry entries required manual processes to find articles. There was no evidence that the proportion of registry entries with automatic links had increased (R (2) = 0.02, p = 0.36). In 39 studies that examined cohorts of articles, 21 used automatic and manual processes; 9 only automatic; and 2 only manual (7 did not specify). Sixteen studies reported numbers for automatic and manual processes and indicated that a median of 49% (range from 8 to 97%) of articles had automatic links to registry entries, and 10% (range from 0 to 28%) required manual processes to find registry entries. There was no evidence that the proportion of articles with automatic links to registry entries had increased (R (2) = 0.01, p = 0.73).
3:::IOP of the left eye fluctuated between 14 and 30 mm Hg in the study period. RNFLT, GCC thickness, and peripapillary PAFD all decreased significantly (linear regression analysis, P=0.030, 0.040, and 0.020, respectively), and a significant 2.1 dB/y progression was seen for a superior visual field cluster. The RNFLT, peripapillary PAFD, and visual field of the right eye remained normal and unchanged.
3:::Our results showed an average sensitivity of 86.7% and 92.9%, an average false prediction rate of 0.126 and 0.096/h, and an average minimum prediction time of 14.3 and 33.3min, respectively, using seizure occurrence periods of 30 and 50min and a seizure prediction horizon of 10s. Two-third of the analyzed seizures showed significantly increased complexity in periods prior to the seizures in comparison with baseline. In four patients, strong bidirectional connectivities between epileptic contacts and the surrounding areas were observed. However, in five patients, unidirectional functional connectivities in preictal periods were observed from remote areas to epileptogenic zones.
3:::The glaucoma group mainly comprised patients with moderate glaucoma (mean deviation of standard automated perimetry, -6.73±6.2 dB). The RNFL thicknesses did not differ between acquisitions with or without the ETS activated and disabled. All ICCs were >0.9 in the control and glaucoma groups with or without the ETS activated. The best parameter in the intersession analysis (with ETS activated) was global RNFL thickness (ICC, 0.95; coefficient of variation, 2.7%; and test-retest variability, 2.87 μm). The reproducibility and repeatability of RNFL measurements did not differ significantly between acquisitions with or without the ETS in either group.
3:::In LV-SW of LVD minipigs the A2AR melting curves were characterized by a sharp peak between 87 and 91 °C (short isoform, 1-94 bp) on the right of the principal peak corresponding to a long A2AR isoform (GenBank: JQ229674.1) 1-213 bp. As for C-SHAM only one peak was observed in LV-OSW region of LVD animals. The short isoform had an alternative promoter region and a specific translated protein. Histology showed in LVD-LV-SW prominent Purkinje cells compared to LV-OSW and C-SHAM. No difference in A2AR expression was observed between LVD animals and C-SHAM although a slight decrease was observed in LVD-LV-OSW.
3:::The mean peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities of the hepatic artery and the peak flow velocity of the portal and hepatic veins were increased after intravenously administration of the USCA, ranging from 10% to 13%. However, the changes were not statistically significant (P=0.097, 0.103, 0.128, and 0.190, respectively). There were no significant differences in other measured parameters, including the resistive index (P=0.205) and systolic acceleration time (P=0.489) of the hepatic artery and venous pulsatility index (P=0.494) of the hepatic vein.
3:::The levels of TNF-α, IL-1beta, IL-8, IL-6, IL-12, MCP-1, and leptin decreased after withdrawal and remained low until M6, regardless of alcohol consumption. IFN-gamma levels remained constant and IL-10 levels changed only slightly. NSE levels were not modified, whereas serum S100-β concentration increased significantly on M1 and then gell, regardless of abstinence status at six months.
3:::Rb1 could maximally stimulate both leptin receptors (OBRa and OBRb) mRNA and protein expression and phosphorylation of STAT3, PI3K and ERK2 in C2C12 myotubes at 10 μM for 3 h. Rb1 induced GLUT4 translocation was inhibited by the silencing of OBRb mRNA, demonstrated that glucose uptake was mediated via leptin receptor activation. GLUT4 recruitment to the cell surface induced by Rb1 was inhibited by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K in combination with OBRb siRNA, but not by PD98059 an ERK2 kinase-1 inhibitor, indicating that GLUT4 translocation induced by Rb1 was associated with the leptin receptor upregulation and subsequent activation of PI3K.
3:::A total of 50 NSCLC-associated MPE cases were identified where molecular testing was requested. Of these, 17 cases were excluded: 14 cases (28%) due to inadequate tumor cellularity and 3 cases due to unavailability of the slides to review. A total of 27 out of 50 MPE cases (54%) underwent at least EGFR and KRAS sequencing and FISH for ALK rearrangement. Of the 27 cases with molecular testing results available, a genetic abnormality was detected in 16 cases (59%). The most common genetic aberrations identified involved EGFR ( 9 ) and KRAS ( 7 ). Six cases had ALK FISH only, of which one showed rearrangement. MPE volume was not associated with overall cellularity or tumor cellularity (P = 0.360).
3:::A total of 358 patients were analyzed. Mean age was 46 ± 17 years. There were 179 patients in each group [ileostomy closure (<3 months) and ileostomy closure (≥3 months)]. Both groups were matched. Groups were comparable in preoperative characteristics and demographics. All of the peri-operative variables were comparable. No difference was observed in estimated blood loss (EBL), operative time (OT) and length of stay (LOS) (all p > 0.05). Postoperative outcomes including wound infection, post-operative bleeding, intra-abdominal abscess, ileus, small bowel obstruction (SBO), anastomotic leak, reoperation, surgery related readmission, postoperative transfusion were also similar among the groups (p > 0.05).
3:::We analysed data from 47 studies across four outcome domains: physical symptoms, health-related quality of life, depression and anxiety. Short-term and long-term treatment effects within each outcome domain were broadly similar and were correlated Reported reduction in physical symptoms was correlated with reductions in depression (rho=0.73, p=0.002) and anxiety (0.70, p<0.001) and increase in quality of life (0.54, p=0.03).
3:::Most respondents consider LVSI a bad prognosis factor for endometrial cancer (66%) and also consider that it should be included in the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification (56%). Seventy-five percent of all gynecologists did not modify their surgical treatment. Regarding follow-up, 38% of the respondents do not change their surveillance, 28% modify it, and 31% reported any change only with additional factors. Forty-seven percent of respondents advise systemic treatment with chemotherapy.Data were dichotomized between less than or equal to 20 versus greater than 20 years of OB-GYN specialist and less than or equal to 5 versus greater than 5 years of main dedication to gynecology oncology, but it was not possible to show any significant differences among the groups. The response rate (34 individuals) was too low to expect any significant differences.
3:::CpG-DNA and CpG-DNA combined with anti-IL-10R Ab could promote MHCII, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-13 molecular expression, and suppress the expression of FRβ, MMP-9 and VEGF, in both freshly isolated peritoneal macrophages and M2 macrophages. In the CpG-DNA combined with anti-IL-10R Ab injecting group, the percentage of CD68(+) MHCII(+) cells were significantly higher than that of CD68(+)FRβ(+) cells (P<0.05). This was distinct from the result of the control group, which CD68(+) FRβ(+) was higher than CD68(+)MHCII(+)cells (P<0.01). Furthermore, VEGF-A and MMP-9 level in primary tumor tissues in the experimental group was significantly lower (P<0.01), compared to the control group. Moreover, the number of detectable lung-metastasis foci was significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group (P<0.05).
3:::During an average follow-up of 41 months, 11 of 37 patients (29.7%) experienced MACE. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, which included LV mass index, LV ejection fraction, the presence of LGE, EccSAX, ErrSAX, EllLV, and ErrLax values, indicated that the presence of LGE (hazard ratio, 42.88; p = 0.014), together with ErrLax (hazard ratio, 0.77 per 1%, p = 0.004), was a significant predictor of MACE. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated worse outcomes in patient with LGE and an ErrLax value ≤ 9.48%. Multivariable backward regression analysis revealed that ErrLax values were the only significant predictors of LV functional recovery (hazard ratio, 0.54 per 1%; p = 0.042).
3:::There was a significant difference in cell viability, when various concentrations of 2-AITFEI-3-F (but similar to I3F) were used for 24, 48 and 72h in comparison to I3F regarding the cellular viability (P<0.05). Real time PCR and Western blotting analysis indicated that the gene and protein expression level of Bcl-2 down-regulated while Bax was up-regulated in compare to untreated control cells and cells treated with I3F (P<0.01).
3:::Of the 2,058 UC patients included in the analysis, a positive family history of IBD was confirmed in 31 patients (1.5%), 24 (77.4%) of whom had only first-degree relatives affected. All the affected relatives had UC and none had Crohns disease. Among first-degree relatives, siblings were found to have the highest prevalence of IBD (53.3%), followed by parents (26.7%).'
3:::The aged Nos2 KO mice had lower survival ratio (P=0.039) and liver coefficient (P=0.002) at the termination phase. Nos2 transcript level was obviously increased after PH in WT mice and undetected in the Nos2 KO mice. During LR, the expression at the transcript level of Cyclin D1, Cyclin A2 and Cyclin B1 and protein expression level of proliferation marker Ki67 and proliferation-associated transcription factors JNK1, NF-kB and STAT3 were decreased or delayed. The expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, CASPASE3, CASPASE9 and BAX, was increased in the Nos2 KO mice.
3:::About 82% of the parents of adolescents interviewed think that offering universal parental support is most important during childs adolescence. There is a substantial interest, particularly among mothers, in most forms of support. Despite their interest, parents have limited awareness of the support available. Only 7% knew about the local municipality website, although 70% reported a possible interest in such a website. Similarly, 3% knew that a parent phone line was available to them, while 59% reported a possible interest.'
3:::The majority of nurses had conflict especially with patients relatives several times a month. It was found that the personality traits of nurses were mostly 'conscientiousness' and 'openness' and when they had a conflict, they tended to use 'integration' strategy. It was also found that the personality traits of nurses had an effect on some of the conflict management strategies adopted by them.'
3:::Overall, 180 infertile couples participated in the three groups. There was a significant higher mean score for hope in husbands compared to wives in the normal infertile group (P=0.046). Husbands in the normal infertile group also had a significantly higher mean score for pathway (P=0.032). The frequency of anxiety significantly differed in female subjects (P=0.028). In the normal infertile group, the anxiety distribution significantly differed between wives and husbands (P=0.006). There was a significantly different stress frequency in male subjects (P=0.048). In the embryo donation group, stress significantly differed between wives and husbands (P=0.002). In the normal infertile group, stress also significantly differed between wives and husbands (P=0.05).
3:::After 3 months of treatment, CO, MDA, PC and Aix were decreased in all subjects (median CO: 25 vs. 6 ppm, MDA: 0.81 vs. 0.63 nmol/L, PC: 0.102, vs. 0.093 nmol/mg protein, Aix: 13% vs. 9%, p < 0.05) while PWV remained unchanged. Endothelial glycocalyx integrity showed a greater improvement in the varenicline than the NRT treatment (PBR range 5-9 μm: 1.07 ± 0.02 vs. 1.17 ± 0.02 μm, p = 0.03) in parallel with the greater CO reduction (5 vs. 7 ppm, p = 0.02). At 1-year follow-up, MDA, PC, Aix and PBR at 5-25 μm range were further improved in subjects who abstained from smoking (n = 84 out of 188), while the above markers and PWV deteriorated in relapsed smokers (p < 0.05).
3:::The factors were described as percentages of the range. The background factors of familicide perpetrators were categorised as follows: perpetrators who had committed homicide of a child and intimate partner and possibly committed suicide; a father had who killed a child; a mother who had killed a child; a father who had committed a filicide-suicide; and a mother who had committed a filicide-suicide.
3:::The team identified a total of six competencies for librarian involvement in systematic reviews: ""Systematic review foundations,"" ""Process management and communication,"" ""Research methodology,"" ""Comprehensive searching,"" ""Data management,"" and ""Reporting."" Within each competency are the associated skills and knowledge pieces (indicators). Competence can be measured using an adaptation of Millers Pyramid for Clinical Assessment, either through self-assessment or identification of formal assessment instruments.'
3:::Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 505) and 15 observational studies (OS) (n = 3785) met the criteria for inclusion. Compared with isolated CABG, concomitant CABG and MV surgery was not associated with increased perioperative mortality (RCTs: relative risk [RR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-3.02; OS: RR 1.40, 95% CI, 0.88-2.23). CABG and MV surgery was associated with significantly lower incidence of moderate-to-severe MR at follow-up (RCTs: RR 0.16, 95% CI, 0.04-0.75; OS: RR 0.20, 95% CI, 0.09-0.48). Late mortality was similar between the surgical approaches in RCTs (hazard ratio [HR] 1.20, 95% CI, 0.57-2.53) and OS (HR 0.99, 95% CI, 0.81-1.21). There were no significant differences in echocardiographic outcomes. These results remained consistent in subgroup analyses restricted to patients with strictly moderate IMR.
3:::The median age at BC diagnosis was 49 years and median follow-up of 14 years. In total, 25 cases of gynecological cancer were noted with an incidence of 0.9%. We observed 9 ovarian and endometrium (0.3%) as well as 7 uterine cervix (0.25%) cancers. Family history of BC was the most significant risk factor for SM (relative risk, 7.4; 95% confidence interval, 3.03-18.28; P<0.001). Women with a family history of BC had a higher incidence of endometrial (12%) and ovarian (16%) cancer compared with those who have no family history (0.1%, P = 0.003). Statistically significant higher incidence of endometrial cancer was seen in patients undergoing hormonal therapy (0.4%) as compared with those who are not undergoing hormonal therapy (0.1%, P = 0.001). Most of the endometrial (88.9%) and cervical (71%) cancers were detected at an early stage but ovarian cancers (66.6%) in advanced stage. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy did not increase the risk of gynecological SM.
3:::Both fusion proteins bound specifically to target cells with high affinity. Furthermore, scFv13-ETA inhibited the proliferation of human cancer cell lines efficiently at low concentrations (IC50 values of 408 pM-7 nM) and induced apoptosis (40-85% of target cells). The bsscFv triggered dose-dependent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, resulting in the lysis of up to 23.9% A2058 cells, 18.0% MDA-MB-468 cells and 19.1% HL-60 cells.'
3:::gm_extractor showed high test-retest reliability and high concurrent validity with FSLs FIRST. Volumetric measurements agreed with the expected anatomical pattern associated with AD. APL and PPL ratios were significantly different between groups, and were selected instead of hippocampal and entorhinal volumes to differentiate normal from MCI or cognitively impaired (MCI plus AD) subjects.'
3:::Among 451 pGS6 patients identified, none had synchronous lymph node metastases and 43/451 (10%) suffered BF. Two patients (0.4%) developed metachronous metastasis during a 110-month median follow-up for BF patients. Both metastatic cases had Gleason pattern 4 on blinded RP review, as did 88% of cases with concern for micrometastasis versus 38% of control cases (P = 0.02). All BF patients (29/29) undergoing postoperative radiation had a complete biochemical response or Gleason pattern 4 on blinded RP review.
3:::There were 593,315 colonoscopies performed on the 426,560 individuals included in the study. The rates for colonoscopy-related bleeding and perforation were 0.17% and 0.11%, respectively. When polypectomy was performed, the rates were 0.53% for bleeding and 0.25% for perforation. There were 31 splenic injuries (1:20,000 colonoscopies) reported. The crude 30-day death rate for colonoscopy was 0.68%. Of those diagnosed with bleeding or perforation, 5.6% and 6.1% were dead within 30 days, respectively. The multivariate RR for perforation when general anaesthesia was employed was 2.65 (p < .001; 95%CI 1.71-4.12).
3:::In GLUTag cells, PANDER exposure led to decreased proglucagon gene mRNA expression and GLP-1 secretion without affecting cell viability or caspase-3 activation. Overexpression of PANDER in mice induced glucose intolerance and impaired glucose-stimulated GLP-1 secretion Moreover, PANDER blocked insulin-induced GLP-1 secretion by inhibiting the insulin signalling-Wnt pathway and directly inhibited the cAMP/PKA pathway.
3:::Females with unexplained infertility had significantly lower levels of KP when compared with those with male factor infertility (176.69 ± 5.03 vs. 397.6 ± 58.2, P=0.001). Clinical pregnancy was observed in 28 (23%) females of which 17 (71%) had a female cause of infertility. In the non-pregnant group of 66 (53%) females, common cause of infertility was unexplained 56(85%). A weak positive correlation of KP levels with fertilized oocytes and endometrial thickness was observed (P=0.04 and 0.01 respectively).
3:::F-DOPA PET/CT was positive in 16 out of 28 (57%) patients, mostly because of metabolically active neck and mediastinal lymph nodes metastases. Previously unknown bone metastases were found in six patients. A positive scan was reported in four patients (25% of positive scans) with a very low calcitonin value of less than 49.9 pmol/l. PET/CT findings led to a change of management and therapy in 16 out of 28 patients, with surgical procedure performed in eight patients, radiotherapy in five patients, and chemotherapy in two patients.
3:::The A allele was significantly associated with sperm abnormality in our population [(P<0.001, odds ratios (OR) 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.31]. In addition, the A allele was also associated with azoospermia (P<0.001, OR (95% CI)=2.484), oligospermia (P=0.005, OR (95% CI)=2.51) and teratospemia (P<0.001, OR (95% CI)=3.385) but not with asthenoteratospermia (P=0.623).
3:::AIRmax (SS) mice showed differential peritoneal macrophage gene expression profiles during PIA, with higher expression and production of H2O2, NO, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and several chemokines. The presence of the Slc11a1 R allele, on the other hand, diminished the intensity of macrophage activation, restricting arthritis development.
3:::The change in the UC-DAI (mean±standard deviation) in the per-protocol set was -2.6±2.47 in the multimatrix mesalazine 4.8 g/day group (n=134) and -1.8±2.64 in the pH-dependent-release mesalazine 3.6 g/day group (n=129). The difference in the mean change between the 2 groups was -0.7 (two-sided 95% confidence interval, -1.3 to -0.1). The noninferiority of multimatrix mesalazine 4.8 g/day to pH-dependent-release mesalazine 3.6 g/day was verified within the noninferiority margin (1.1). The superiority of multimatrix mesalazine 4.8 g/day to pH-dependent-release mesalazine 3.6 g/day was also investigated and confirmed in the full analysis set, according to the study protocol. In subgroup analyses, the effectiveness of multimatrix mesalazine 4.8 g/day was consistent in all subgroups. There was no difference in safety between the 2 treatment groups.
3:::After controlling for age and race, muscle LPL and CPT-1 were lower in IGT, and the ratios of fat/muscle LPL activity were higher in IGT compared to NGT. Muscle LPL was related to insulin sensitivity (M value) and inversely related to G120 , fasting insulin, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance. AEX+WL decreased abdominal fat LPL and increased muscle LPL, ACS, and CS. The ratios of fat/muscle LPL decreased after AEX+WL. The change in VO2 max was related to the changes in LPL, ACS, and CS and inversely related to the changes in fat/muscle LPL activity ratios.
3:::Serum levels of LPS were significantly elevated in the active CD group (P=0.003). Levels of IL-1β (P=0.002), IL-6 (P=0.003), and IL-17 (P<0.001) were lower in the CD groups. Serum TNF-α levels were increased in the active CD group. The CRP levels were elevated in the CD groups when compared to controls (P<0.001). The CD26 levels were lower in the CD groups than in the control group (P<0.001). Among the variables analyzed, there was a correlation between LPS and CRP (r=-0.53, P=0.016) in the CD groups.
3:::We identified 18 patients with predominant LVF or PS. IEDs in PS were 1.7-times sharper as determined by the high-frequency power increase than IEDs in LVF. In contrast, IEDs in LVF had a 1.2-times higher post-spike slow wave amplitude, and a 1.5-times larger low-frequency power content than IEDs in PS. There was no difference in rates of IEDs/HFOs, spike amplitude, HFO co-occurrence, and EEG background.
3:::BCVA significantly improved after the loading phase and was maintained in the maintenance phase. CMT and CCT significantly reduced after the loading phase and were maintained throughout the follow-up period. The number of injections averaged 7.72 in the first year and 4.67 in the second year. The average number of polypoidal lesions per patient was 2.43 before treatment. In 32 patients (55.2%), polypoidal lesions regressed completely after the loading phase; these patients also needed significantly fewer injections compared to other patients. CCT at baseline was positively correlated with the decreased amount of CCT after 2 years and negatively correlated with the number of injections for 2 years.
3:::SNVs in three NPC genes were associated with response to platinum on univariate analysis. SNV rs79419059 (10T>C) in Nucleoporin 107 (Nup107) was associated with platinum resistance (P=0.0061), whereas rs2302811 (3662-4A>G) in Nucleoporin 188 (Nup188) and rs77246077 (3420-67T>A) in Nucleoporin 214 (Nup214) were associated with platinum sensitivity (P=0.0483 and 0.0091, respectively). Controlling for other confounders, multivariate age-adjusted Cox proportional hazard analysis showed rs79419059 to be significantly associated with platinum resistance (odds ratio: 4.519, 95% confidence interval: 1.317-15.501, P=0.0457).
3:::We observed that total phenolic and flavonoids content in EELs were respectively 60.1mg of gallic acid equivalent/g of extract and 15.4mg of catechin equivalent/g of extract. Chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric and ferulic acids, as well as quercetin were identified in EELs. This extract also led to the consumption of the radicals 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) and nitric oxide, increased the ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) and inhibited the spontaneous or FeSO4-induced in vitro lipid peroxidation. In the formalin test, oral pretreatment with EELs (400mg/kg) reduced (p<0.001) the licking/biting time in the second phase, but not in the first phase. In the ear inflammation induced by TPA, the concomitant topical administration of EELs (0.3-3mg/ear) significantly reduced the edema, myeloperoxidase activity, levels of tumoral necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β and lipoperoxidation, as well as increased FRAP in ear tissue when compared to vehicle-treated ears.'
3:::As expected, insulin-dependent people with diabetes had higher risk profiles than noninsulin-dependent people with diabetes (median logistic EuroSCORE, 4.1 vs. 3.5%, P = 0.086). However, there were no differences in in-hospital mortality both in unmatched and propensity score-matched series (2.5 vs. 2%, P = 0.65 and 2.8 vs. 1.9%, P = 0.52, respectively). In propensity score-matched pairs, only prolonged invasive ventilation (P = 0.0039) and deep sternal wound infection (P = 0.071) were more frequent in insulin-dependent people with diabetes. No differences were found as the late outcomes.
3:::A total of 34,694 patients were analyzed. Among infected patients, 72.3% had 1 infected site (IS), 23% had 2 ISs, and 4.7% had 3 ISs. Median LOS was 24 days in infected patients (20.4 days among patients with 1 IS, 34.2 days among patients with 2 ISs, and 45.3 days among patients with 3 ISs) and 5 days in noninfected patients (P < .001). Two groups of multi-infected patients with long LOSs were identified with the heat map.
3:::Three themes describe the communication challenges men face: (1) It can be too soon to talk about sex; (2) the psychology of sex is missing; (3) communication is not individually tailored.
3:::Histopathologic examination of the injection sites showed evidence of hair growth in samples that received cells compared with the control group. However, the group that received epithelial and dermal papilla cells had visible evidence of hair growth. PKH tracing confirmed the presence of transplanted cells in the new hair.
3:::In total, 1.025 participants (57.4% females) were enrolled. The median age was 34years (interquartile range: 26-48); 14.9% and 9.8% of the participants were known hypertensive and diabetes patients, respectively. Overall, 99% of participants had already heard about stroke. The mean score of knowledge was 81.3±11.1%. The main sources of information on stroke were the close entourage (83.0%) and the health personnel (73.0%); media (television (16.4%), newspaper (8.0%), internet (7.7%), and radio (2.2%)) and school (8.0%) were the least represented. Speech disturbances (98.3%) and weakness, numbness or paralysis of one part of the body (98.0%) were the major warning signs and symptoms cited. Hypertension (98.5%) and overweight/obesity (97.8%) were the most known risk factors; 98.7% of people were aware of stroke common complications. Younger age (<45years), male sex, lower level of education and previous experience of stroke education were independently associated with a lower level of knowledge on stroke.
3:::One patient (1%) had RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) complete response (CR), 13 patients (16.5%) experienced a partial response (PR), and 28 (35%) stable disease (SD). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.8 months (range 2.63-3.83), with 24% of patients displaying PFS >5 months. Median growth modulation index (GMI) was 0.85 (range 0-15.61) and 32.5% of patients had GMI >1.33. KRAS exon 2 mutations were found in 38.5% of patients, and among the 78 patients with known KRAS status, those with wild-type tumors had longer PFS than those with mutated tumors (3.80 [95% CI 2.80-5.03] vs. 2.13 months [95% CI 1.77-2.87], respectively, p = 0.001). Median overall survival (OS) was 7.83 months (range 7.17-9.33) for all patients, and patients with KRAS wild-type tumors had longer OS than those with mutated tumors (7.83 [95% CI 7.33-10.80] vs. 7.18 months [95% CI 5.63-9.33], respectively, p = 0.06).
3:::Across patients, our BCI-driven approach resulted in a statistically significant average increase of 6.2 points in the Action Research Arm Test. This behavioral improvement significantly correlated with improvements in BCI control. Secondary outcomes of grasp strength, Motricity Index, and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure also significantly improved.
3:::Twenty patients (67%) were male. The median patient age at diagnosis was 56 years (range, 39-76 years). A total of 702 polyps were identified during a median follow-up of 43 months (range, 0-149 months). Serrated polyps were noted more frequently in the distal colon (298/702, 55%). However, large serrated polyps and serrated adenomas were mainly distributed throughout the proximal colon (75% vs. 25% and 81% vs. 19%, respectively); 73.3% had synchronous adenomatous polyps. The incidence of CRC was 10% (3/30 patients), but no interval CRC was detected. A total of 87% of the patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and 19.2% had significant lesions.
3:::The presence of calcification, higher cortex involvement ratio, and lower V e value were more representative of oligodendrogliomas than astrocytic tumors (P = <0.001, 0.038, and <0.001, respectively). The area under the curve (AUC) value of a combination of calcification and cortex involvement ratio was 0.796. The combination of all three parameters, including V e, further increased the diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.881). Comparison test of the two AUC areas revealed significant difference (P = 0.0474). The presence of calcification and higher cortex involvement ratio were the only findings suggestive of oligodendrogliomas than astrocytic tumors with exclusion of GBMs (P = 0.014 and <0.001, respectively).
3:::Exposure to elevated temperature the preceding week was associated with a higher likelihood of traction detachment, but not other forms of retinal detachment. Associations were stronger at <75 years of age in both men and women. Relative to 15°C, a mean weekly temperature of 25°C was associated with an OR for traction detachment of 2.71 (95% CI 1.56-4.71) before 55 years, 2.73 (95% CI 1.61-4.64) at 55-64 years, and 1.98 (95% CI 1.30-3.02) at 64-75 years.
3:::The mean follow-up was 19.8 years. In group 1, the preintervention and postintervention IOPs were 14.7 ± 1.3 and 9.1 ± 2.0 mmHg, respectively (P < .001, 38% reduction). The MD slope decreased significantly after trabeculectomy (-0.86 ± 0.51 versus -0.19 ± 0.20 dB/y; P < .001). In group 2, the preintervention and postintervention IOPs were 14.7 ± 1.5 and 11.7 ± 1.2 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.001, 20% reduction), with significant differences in the MD slope (-0.52 ± 0.37 versus -0.31 ± 0.30 dB/y; P = .019). In group 3, the preintervention and postintervention IOPs were 14.4 ± 1.8 and 13.2 ± 1.6 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.001, 8% reduction), with no differences in the MD slope (-0.40 ± 0.27 versus -0.50 ± 0.65 dB/y; P > .05). Multiple regression analysis showed that the average IOP, IOP reduction rate, and preintervention MD slope were related to the extent of the postintervention reduction in the MD slope. The difference in the preintervention and postintervention MD slopes significantly correlated with the rate of IOP reduction (r = 0.559, P < .001).
3:::In multivariable analyses, participants had significantly higher adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of CAI when the participant (AOR=22.2, 95%CI=2.5-199.5) or their partners used any drugs (AOR=21.8, 95%CI=3.3-144.3); their partners (AOR=5.7, 95%CI=1.7-19.3) or both participant and partner had concordant use of methamphetamine (AOR=10.5, 95%CI=2.2-50.6); or when both used poppers (AOR=11.4, 95%CI=1.5-87). There were higher odds of SDCAI if the participant binge drank (AOR=4, 95%CI=1.01-15.8), used more than one substance (AOR=15.8, 95%CI=1.9-133), or used other drugs (AOR=4.8, 95%CI=1.3-18.4); if their partner used poppers (AOR=7.6, 95%CI=1.5-37.6), or used more than one substance (AOR=7.9, 95%CI=1.9-34.1); and when both participant and partner had concordant use of poppers (AOR=4.4, 95%CI=1.2-16.8).
3:::Records of 153 students and questionnaires of 118 students were included in the study. Combined grades from psychometric tests and matriculation exams at admission, low PS, absence due to military reserve service during the academic year, and participation in the second and third years of the PT program accounted for a modest variance (31.1% ) in students GPA.'
3:::Co-administration of VitE and T significantly (P<0.05) increased ATZ-decreased TAC and TTM levels and reduced ATZ-increased MDA content. T and VitE significantly (P<0.05) increased serum levels of ATZ-reduced T (1.94 ± 0.96), IN-B (122.10 ± 24.33) and LH (0.40 ± 0.10). The T+VitE animals showed a reduction in apoptotic cells and an increase in Leydig cells steroidogenesis. Co-administration of T and VitE significantly (P<0.05) reduced the ATZ-induced DNA disintegrity and chromatin de-condensation. VitE and T protected germinal cells RNA and protein contents against ATZ-induced damages.
3:::Patients with PTSD had a higher degree of chronic pain, more depression and nonspecific physical symptoms (including and excluding pain) compared with the control group (Fisher exact test p < 0.001, and Chi-squared test, p < 0.001, < 0.001, < 0.001, respectively). Patients with PTSD also had more pain after periodontal probing compared with controls (Mann-Whitney, p = 0.037). The prevalence of sites with CAL or PPD ≥ 4, ≥ 5, ≥ 6 were not different between the groups. Age was associated with moderate periodontitis (multivariable logistic regression model, OR = 3.33, 95% CI = 1.03-10.75, p = 0.04).
3:::Statistical analysis of data showed a significant root resorption between the experimental group and control group (P<0.05), however, there was no significant difference in the expression level of the inflammatory cytokine, TGF-β1.
3:::The 50 highest cited articles had up to 1624 citations. The top ten papers on this topic were cited 600 times at least. Most papers were published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine. The publication years spanned from 1941 to 2007, with the 1990s and 2000s accounting for half of the articles (n = 25). Seven countries contributed to the top 50 list, with the USA having by far the most contribution (n = 40). The majority of articles could be attributed to the category ""Clinical Science & Outcome"". Most of them represent a high level of evidence.
3:::Disease-specific survival (59 vs 94 months vs not reached; P < 0.001) and overall survival (31 vs 37 vs 45 months; P < 0.001) improved over time. In univariable analyses, only those with stage I-III and those who reside in the Western or Central regions were noted to have improvement over time. In multivariable analyses when adjusting for age, race, marital status, stage, geographic location, cancer-related surgery, extent of lymphadenectomy, and adjuvant radiation, patients who received the diagnosis during 2005 to 2011 were 22% less likely to die of uterine cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.87; P < 0.001) and 17% less likely to die of any cause (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76-0.90; P < 0.0001) compared with patients who received a diagnosis during 1988-1997. Similarly, patients who received a diagnosis during 1998-2004 were 15% less likely to die of uterine cancer (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.94; P = 0.0015) and 10% less likely to die of any cause (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83-0.97; P = 0.0048) compared with patients who received a diagnosis during 1988-1997.
3:::D21 demonstrated significantly higher values of incremental area under the curve (IAUC) for glucose 2300 to 0800h (644±156vs. 147±63mmol/L×min, p<0.01, mean±standard error of the mean) and incremental glucose peak (IGP) after dinner (6.78±0.79 vs. 3.09±0.62mmol/L, p<0.01) compared to those of D18. Moreover, the mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE) of D21 tended to be higher than that of D18 (6.99±0.60 vs. 5.35±0.51mmol/L, p=0.077). However, the divided dinner significantly reduced IAUC 2300 to 0800h (142±60mmol/L×min, p<0.01), IGP after dinner (3.75±0.58mmol/L, p<0.01), and MAGE (5.33±0.41mmol/L, p<0.01) compared to those of D21.
3:::A significant difference in GWCCS total score was observed between entering and exiting students in health sciences, with the exiting students being more culturally competent.
3:::Total retinal blood flow was higher in diabetic participants (46.4 ± 7.4 μl/min) than in healthy volunteers (40.4 ± 5.3 μl/min, p = 0.002 between groups). Oxygen content in retinal arteries was comparable between the two groups, but oxygen content in retinal veins was higher in participants with diabetes (0.15 ± 0.02 ml O2/ml) compared with healthy control participants (0.13 ± 0.02 ml O2/ml, p < 0.001). As such, the arteriovenous oxygen difference and total retinal oxygen extraction were reduced in participants with diabetes compared with healthy volunteers (total retinal oxygen extraction 1.40 ± 0.44 vs 1.70 ± 0.47 μl O2/min, respectively, p = 0.03).
3:::All subjects, regardless of the intervention, demonstrated improved function, decreased pain, increased ROM, and increased strength. Additionally, a clinically relevant difference was found between the intervention and control groups for the OSW and LEFS.
3:::Attempts to explain successive variation for analysis of BPV with patients characteristics at admission found systolic BP (5.5% variance) to be most influential, yet 92% of BPV variance remained unexplained. Independently from systolic BP, successive variation for analysis of BPV was associated with poor functional outcome mRS score of 0 to 2 (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90-0.98), disadvantage across the shift of mRS (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08), mortality (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08), SICHSITS (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06-1.23), and SICHECASS (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.10-1.40; ECASS [European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study 2]). Analyzing successive variation for analysis of BPV as a function of pre-treatment, systolic BP significantly improved the prediction of functional outcome (mRS score of 0-1, mRS score of 0-2, neurological improvement, mRS-shift: all Pinteraction<0.01). Excluding patients with atrial fibrillation in a sensitivity analysis gave consistent results overall.
3:::In total, 11.7% (N = 1048) of the respondents reported having multiple jobs and 7.6% (N = 678) experienced LTSA during follow-up. After adjustment for confounders, no significant association between LTSA and MJH in general (OR = 0.82), combination MJH (OR = 0.81), or hybrid MJH (OR = 0.83) was found. Among employees working more than 37 h per week, combination MJH was associated with a higher likelihood of LTSA (OR = 1.50).
3:::Analysis indicated a significant change in responses for one of the four AHO statements and significant correlation between caregiver ZBIS score and student post-CGI ZBIS score.
3:::In IS patients, none of the analyzed gene distributions differed concerning the stenosis degree. Nevertheless, a trend was observed for the rs662 and rs7493 variants of the PON1 and PON2 genes respectively. When evaluated the results based on different inheritance models, a significant contribution of rs7493 variant according to a dominant (OR=2.397, 95% CI (1.001-5.376); p=0.045) and log-additive inheritance forms (OR=1.85, 95% CI (1.07-3.2); p=0.03) was observed. Only rs7493 reached statistical significance (p=0.013), when genotype distribution was analyzed according to carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and remain significant in multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR=2.66, 95% CI (1.1 to 6.4); p=0.03).
3:::Increased ORs for all users were observed. In the case-control study, the highest odds were seen among newly initiated zolpidem-only users involved in single-vehicle crashes (adjusted OR 2.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-4.24), followed by frequent combined zolpidem and zopiclone users [adjusted OR 2.20; CI 1.21-4.00]. In the case-crossover, newly initiated treatment with zolpidem or zopiclone showed an increased risk that was highest in the 2 weeks after the start of the treatment (OR 2.66; 95% CI 1.04-6.81).
3:::Over one-third of reviews (37%) did not search the CAB Abstracts database, and 9% of reviews searched only 1 database. Over two-thirds of reviews (65%) did not report any search for grey literature or stated that they excluded grey literature. The majority of reviews (95%) did not report a reproducible search strategy.
3:::There was no significant difference in the survival rate after vitrification and warming of GV (93.5%) and MII oocytes (90.8%). A significantly higher maturation rate occurred when IVM was performed before vitrification (82.9%) compared to after vitrification (51%). There was no significant difference in the incidence of normal spindle/ chromosome configurations among warmed oocytes matured in vitro before (50.0%) or after (41.2%) vitrification. However, a higher incidence of normal spindle/chromosome configurations existed in the in vitro matured oocytes which were not subjected to vitrification (fresh oocytes, 77.9%).
3:::Surgical margin guidelines were adhered to in 35% of cases; 45% were over treated and 21% were undertreated. Factors independently associated with non-concordance on multivariate analysis were lower Breslow thickness, lower socio-economic status of the physicians practice location, older physician age, lower physician caseload, and physicians who biopsied the lesion and then referred for definitive management. Complications were not related to over- or under-treatment on multivariate analysis (p = 0.72). Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 17% of patients with invasive melanoma, with the main determinant for selection being a Breslow thickness >0.75 mm.'
3:::Of 859 consenting survivors, 839 (98%) reported healthcare utilization, with 52% female and a mean age of 49 years old. Over 12 months, 339 (40%) patients reported at least one post-discharge hospitalization, with median estimated hospital costs of US$18,756 (interquartile range $7852-46,174; 90th percentile $101,500). Of 16 patient baseline and ICU variables evaluated, only cardiovascular comorbidity and length of stay were associated with hospitalization, and sepsis was associated with hospital costs. At 6-month assessment, better patient-reported physical activity and quality of life status were associated with fewer hospitalizations and lower hospital costs during subsequent follow-up, and worse psychiatric symptoms were associated with increased hospitalizations.
4:::Education, childhood SES, and intelligence have modest but important associations with lifetime stroke, and hence dementia, risks. Future studies distinguishing between the individual and combined effects of education, childhood SES and intelligence are needed to determine the independent contribution of each factor to stroke risk. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B210.
4:::The HEI is considered as a reliable and valid instrument for screening depression and anxiety, which may have substantial clinical value to detect patients emotional disturbances especially in the busy non-psychiatric clinical settings in China.'
4:::In all patients with RH, the catheter-based RDN is not more effective in lowering ambulatory or office BP than an optimized antihypertensive drug treatment at 6 and 12 months. However, among RH patients with higher baseline SBP, RDN might be more effective in reducing SBP.
4:::The measured velocities of graft hepatic vessels tended to increase after administration of USCA, but without statistical significance. The comparison of serial Doppler parameters with or without injection of USCA is valid during Doppler surveillance in recipients of LT.
4:::Alterations in recovery of the probes differ markedly in different epidemiologic contexts in children living in the developing world. The rate of change in the L:M-z ratio was most rapid and consistently disparate from the reference standard in the period between 6 and 9 months of age, suggesting that this is a critical period of physiologic impact of enteropathy in these populations.
4:::These results suggested that the resting-state functional connectivity pattern in the prefrontal cortex may be a transdiagnostic difference between depression and schizophrenia patients.
4:::In this First-in-Human series, diaphragm pacing with a temporary catheter was safe and effectively contributed to ventilation in conjunction with a mechanical ventilator.
4:::The finding that fear reactivity to the laboratory challenges can potentially serve as a viable behavioral correlate of ASCC provides a potentially useful exposure exercise for clients experiencing high levels of ASCC. Given the association between ASCC and severe psychopathology, with further investigation and refinement, such exposure exercises could be integrated into cognitive-behavioral treatments.
4:::Migraine with co-existing tension-type headache and neck pain was highly prevalent in a clinic-based sample. Persons with migraine and co-existing tension-type headache and neck pain may require more individually tailored interventions to increase the level of physical activity, and to improve psychological well-being, perceived stress and self-rated health.
4:::It is possible that EF can also negatively impact healing of a wound, and thus should be a consideration to clinicians when a delay in proper wound healing is encountered postoperatively. Therefore, in the postoperative period, when the wound healing is most active, we recommend avoiding programs that require frequent pulse generator recharges.
4:::Fecal calprotectin is a useful test for predicting escalation of therapy in established inflammatory bowel disease.
4:::Two very different approaches for testing the hypothesis both gave a negative result. For all seven ganglion cell models, rates of ganglion cell loss were highly affected by fluctuations in height of the hill of vision. Methods for reducing effects of between-visit variability are needed in order to assess progression by relating perimetric sensitivities and ganglion cell numbers.
4:::GS is a rare association of thymoma and immunodeficiency with a poor prognosis. Astute clinical acumen and increased awareness of the clinical and immunological profile of GS are needed to increase early diagnosis, that would benefit improved therapeutic effects.
4:::Preoperative CDI does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of pouchitis in patients with CUC.
4:::Treatment with abdominal radiotherapy increases the risk of developing hypertension complicating pregnancy in Wilms tumor survivors, and diabetes mellitus and anemia complicating pregnancy in all survivors. These patients may require extra vigilance during pregnancy.
4:::In this study, targeting young adults (≤50 years), the bowel preparation achieved by patients using the smartphone app showed significantly better quality than that of the control group.
4:::This pilot study yielded promising findings from the multicomponent Families on Track Integrated Preventive Intervention for child and caregiver outcomes. An important next step is to complete a randomized control trial of the Families on Track Program with a larger sample fully representative of this underserved clinical population with built-in study of implementation parameters.
4:::Children and adults with celiac disease have similar rates of extraintestinal manifestations. In children short stature, fatigue, and headache were most common, whereas anemia, fatigue, and headache/psychiatric disorders were most common in adults. Children on a strict GFD showed faster and higher rates of symptom resolution as compared to adults. Unresponsive children with short stature must be assessed for comorbidities.
4:::Increased VSR was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. This suggests that the location of fat deposits may be more important than the actual amount of body fat.
4:::The limited availability of Medicaid HCBS sexuality service provision not only hints at a lack of understanding of sexuality for people with IDD, but also presents an opportunity to perform increased evaluations on current service offerings in order to justify future expanded offerings in other states.
4:::A decrease in tear film stability occurs 1 month after CRS, the change in the blink pattern and unchanged LLT preoperatively and postoperatively suggesting that these parameters play a role in maintaining tear film stability after CRS.
4:::- With appropriate preparation, planning, and stepwise implementation, whole slide imaging can be used safely and reliably for frozen sections, consultation, quality assurance, and primary diagnosis.
4:::We present evidence suggesting that the association between body size perception and poor mental health in adolescence is changing over time. This may play a role in the recently observed worsening of mental well-being in Scottish adolescents.
4:::FLG and POSTN expression may be downregulated and upregulated, respectively, in the esophageal mucosa of patients with active EoE, and these changes may be restored with treatment in a significant percentage of cases.
4:::In the human ureter, TRPA1 is located to sensory nerves and interstitial cells. TRPA1 agonists inhibited electrically induced contractions but had no direct effect on smooth muscle tension of the human ureter. A role for TRPA1 in modulating neurotransmission and possibly peristalsis of the human ureter is proposed.
4:::Most habitual toileting behaviors were not associated with urinary urgency except waiting too long to urinate when at work. Logistic regression revealed significant relationships among health-related factors, personal characteristics, behaviors, and urinary urgency. LUTS in women is both a womens health and occupational health issue.'
4:::The use of ASIF/TPS with triple pedicle screws could be a reasonable option for the treatment of type B unstable pelvic fractures.
4:::In this retrospective observational study, no differences in tolerance or adherence between AZA and MP were observed in patients naïve to thiopurines. However, MP treatment was at a higher equivalent thiopurine dose than AZA treatment, which tended to be associated with better treatment response. .
4:::Despite their free access to cART, subgroups of migrants facing multiple levels of vulnerability still have difficulties in gaining optimal HIV care.
4:::LC infection following PLND for prostate cancer is usually monomicrobial and caused by Gram+ cocci. GI tract and skin flora are the main habitat. High index of suspicion of infected LC is undertaken in the presence of leukocytosis, fever and abnormal CT findings. Based upon our local hospital antibiogram, combination of IV ampicillin/sulbactam and vancomycin is suggested as the best initial empiric therapy in treating these patients.
4:::SCAD has a high prevalence in young female AMI population in Jiangsu, China. Discriminating the cause of AMI in young female population is very important.
4:::In a considerable proportion of patients who developed AIT/AIH, earlier thyroid function tests showed no subclinical AIT/AIH. Less than half of the patients with a subclinical event subsequently developed overt AIT/AIH. This study provides data to reconsider the yield of regular testing of thyroid function to predict overt thyroid dysfunction in amiodarone treated patients.
4:::We did not identify any survival benefit from critical care admission following surgery.
4:::Designs of PAL with more negative horizontal mean power gradients are the most effective in lowering the lag of accommodation in myopes. This could make them good test candidates for myopia control applications.
4:::This study reveals a high burden of periodontitis among adults living in circumpolar communities in Norway. The results showed sociodemographic disparities regarding periodontitis, and highlights the importance of further investigation of factors influencing periodontal health.
4:::BCRP and MRP2 regulated the in vivo disposition of acacetin glucuronides. The coupling of glucuronidation and efflux transport was probably the primary reason for the low bioavailability of acacetin.
4:::This newly described deletion is likely to lead to loss of function in the functionally important GTPase domain encoded by exons 9-16, and the heterozygosity suggested that haploinsufficiency caused the phenotypes. The deletion may be associated with mild DOA phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic to moderately decreased visual acuity.
4:::The prevalence of HPV and p16 positivity was relatively low and p16 status was a poor surrogate marker for HPV status. The results showed the importance of p16 expression in prognosticating mobile tongue cancer.
4:::These results provide more compelling evidence for the role of zolpidem or zopiclone in the occurrence of RTCs among older adults, not only in frequent users, but also at the beginning of treatment.
4:::The results of this study suggest that airway parameters in different COPD grades have no uniform tendency of correlation with PFT, but some HRCT parameters are correlated to some PFT parameters.
4:::Our results suggest that differences in emotional response may be negligible when PD patients and healthy controls are presented with dynamic, ecologically valid emotional stimuli. Given the limited data available on pupil response in PD, this study provides new evidence to suggest that the PD-related deficits in emotion processing reported in the literature may not translate to real-world differences in physiological or subjective emotion processing in early-stage PD patients.
4:::Most POPs were positively but not significantly associated with incident diabetes. PCB151 was significantly predictive and HCB was significantly protective for diabetes. Among participants with diabetes, low-chlorine PCBs increase the risk of ESRD and death without ESRD, whereas several PSTs predict death without ESRD.
4:::In a large sample of Australian adolescents, diabetes strengths were strongly related to key resilient outcomes, even in the presence of well-documented psychological and family risk factors. More research is needed to determine whether strengths reduce or buffer other risks. Given the associations with self-management, HbA1c, and general QOL, monitoring and enhancing diabetes strengths may support resilience promotion during a vulnerable developmental period.
4:::From 1985 to 2009, the SMR among men diagnosed with PCa decreased significantly in Finland. Among men with localized PCa, the SMR decreased even below that of the Finnish male population. This and the increased difference between relative and cause-specific survival reflects most likely selection of men to opportunistic PSA testing. The results highlight the importance of caution in the use of PSA testing in healthy men.
4:::This study conclusively demonstrates that the plantar flexor muscles of the PAD patient at baseline and without pain are weaker in patients with PAD compared with controls. With the onset of claudication pain, patients with PAD exhibit altered muscle control strategies and further strength deficits are manifest compared to baseline levels. The myopathy of PAD legs appears to have a central role in the functional deterioration of the calf muscles, as it is evident both before and after onset of ischemic pain.
4:::Associations between airborne pollen and daily clinic visits for pollinosis could be enhanced by high levels of specific PM2.5 compositions, especially non-sea-salt Ca(2+).
4:::Our findings can be used to counsel patients prior to their initial injection and suggest that patients with diabetes can be managed with corticosteroid injection with equal efficacy compared with patients without diabetes.
4:::This new system can be used for the management of the early phase after device implantation or replacement and appears clinically useful and well tolerated. Further studies on a larger scale are needed to test the potential reduction of post-intervention complications and the cost-effectiveness of this device.
4:::The present research suggests that lexical tone contour plays an important role in Mandarin sentence recognition, and misrepresented tone contours result in greater difficulty in sentence recognition in younger children. These results imply that maturation and/or language use experience play a role in the processing of tone contours for Mandarin speech understanding, particularly in noise.
4:::A single endophytic fungus, A. sulphureus MME12 was isolated and identified using molecular profiling. The above-mentioned findings support the pharmacological application of A. sulphureus MME12 extract and demand for purification of the active principle(s).
4:::The absolute boron concentrations in tissues/tumors can be estimated from the SUVs on (18)F-FBPA PET using a practical formula. Caution must be exercised in interpreting the estimated boron concentrations in the lung, small intestine and large intestine, to prevent the adverse effects of overexposure, which could occur due to underestimation by partial volume effect using PET.
4:::Hypercapnic acidosis during the first 24 hours of intensive care admission is more strongly associated with increased hospital mortality than compensated hypercapnia or normocapnia.
4:::Patients undergoing single TFR surgery under WALANT trended toward less time in the OR, had similar surgical times, and spent significantly less time in the recovery room, compared with MAC, thereby resulting in less indirect costs. Each MAC case also had minimum direct excess anesthesia charges of $105, which knowingly underestimates overall charges as it excludes material and fixed costs associated with the delivery of anesthesia. Avoiding sedation for high-volume procedures such as TFR may result in significant systemic savings to payers, and in the future with bundling and episode-based payments can become increasingly important to patients, facilities, and surgeons.
4:::SRT treatment with RFD showed favorable visual and anatomical outcomes in patients with chronic CSC.
4:::Adhesive capsulitis can be accurately diagnosed on non-contrast MRI shoulder examinations with appropriate clinical criteria without direct MR arthrography.
4:::This single-institution retrospective study indicates that in a heavily pretreated population approximately 4% of mCRC tumors display a potential actionable molecular context suitable for therapeutic intervention. Application of molecular selection is challenging but improves clinical outcome even in later lines of treatment.
4:::This study showed that increasing vegetable portions in combination with decreasing meat portions (unknowingly to the consumer) increased the amount of vegetables consumed and decreased the amount of meat consumed. Furthermore, despite the changes in portion sizes, participants remained satisfied with their restaurant visit and main dish. The findings of this study suggest that modifying portion size in restaurants is an effective tool for stimulating vegetable consumption and consequently healthy and sustainable diets.
4:::Arthroscopic arthrolysis is an effective treatment option for patients with restriction in elbow motion reasoned by post-traumatic or degenerative changes. Both groups showed a significant improvement of ROM and comparable outcome scores.
4:::Only 72% of the patients received a documented BI during the initial hospitalization for AAP. The in-hospital BI as such did not prevent the development of RAP. Young patients with AUDIT points ≥20 are especially at high risk for developing RAP and should be included in a more intense follow-up care program to maximize prevention.
4:::Wrist hemiarthroplasty in our series had a significant failure rate. In each case of failure, the patient developed ulnar-sided wrist pain. In the presence of more reliable procedures, wrist hemiarthroplasty is not indicated in its current incarnation.
4:::Up to 200 mg/d (2.2-3.9 mg/kg/d) oral ART were safe and well tolerated; therefore, 200 mg/d are recommended for phase II/III trials. Safety monitoring should include reticulocytes, NTproBNP, as well as audiological and neurological exploration.
4:::This review supports the fact that depending on the clinical status of the participants and the modality, exercise training improves different aspects of the muscle oxygenation in older adults.
4:::CHB with spontaneous SAE responded similarly to treatment using either LVD or ETV, with both drugs inducing a rapid decline of HBV viral load.
4:::Cervical spinal tumors, curettage, and nonintact tumors were risk factors for local recurrence. Intralesional curettage and malignancy were the most important significant factors for local recurrence and death, respectively.
4:::This study shows that community-level HIV stigma may be a driver for risky sex and self-reported STDs, particularly among women. Our findings suggest that community-held stigmatizing beliefs and HIV disclosure concerns among women might be important targets for HIV stigma reduction interventions.
4:::Our data describe the good compliance of paediatric T1D patients treated at eight paediatric units in Spain following international standards of metabolic control.
4:::The SAPS 3 score system exhibited satisfactory performance even superior to APACHE II in discrimination. In predicting hospital mortality, SAPS 3 did not exhibit good calibration and overestimated hospital mortality, which demonstrated that SAPS 3 needs improvement in the future.
4:::In the United States, it is important to recognize variations in practice of syndactyly surgery in hopes of developing quality improvement strategies in pediatric orthopedic surgery.
4:::The sequences provided important information about M. avium heterogenicity and evolution as a pathogen. The limitation is the lack of understanding on possible overlapping functions of genes/proteins.
4:::Individuals who are higher in trait mindfulness are more likely to use PBS, which leads to a decrease in the experience of alcohol-related consequences. Furthermore, for individuals lower in mindfulness, low PBS use may lead to increased experience of alcohol consequences. Interventions that incorporate PBS may be most beneficial for students who are low in mindfulness and unlikely to engage in drinking control strategies.
4:::Delirium occurs in at least 1 in 5 patients after transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement. Delirium is less likely to develop in the transcatheter group but is associated with higher mortality in both groups.
4:::A web-mediated follow-up algorithm based on self-reported symptoms improved OS due to early relapse detection and better performance status at relapse.
4:::Physical health was more severely impaired than was mental health, and both types improved over time. The EuroQol-5-Dimensions-5-Levels instrument was useful for detecting neurological problems of the lower extremities early and may qualify as a core outcome measure for patients treated with ECMO.
4:::Additional administration of tamsulosin showed significantly greater and sooner relief in LUTS than ADT monotherapy, with good acceptability. It is feasible that ADT is used alone after 16-24 weeks of combination therapy.
4:::The prevalence and distribution of HR-HPV varied with age and cervical cytology findings. This information would be helpful in the development of cervical cancer prevention policies.
4:::While a large number of hospitalisations and deaths due to pneumococcal disease still occur among children 0-59 months in South Africa, we found a large reduction in this estimate that is temporally associated with PCV introduction. In HIV-infected individuals the scale-up of other interventions, such as improvements in HIV care, may have also contributed to the declines in pneumococcal burden.
4:::These results demonstrated that Huangkui capsule and the flavonoids components prevent tubulointerstitial fibrosis in CRF rat involvement in the action mechanism of inhibiting NADPH oxidase/ROS/ERK pathway.
4:::This study found that postoperative SIR was overall less pronounced in RALC, thus depicting reduced tissue trauma. No major clinical differences between RALC-IUD and -EUD were found.
4:::The disc-shaped thiolated chitosan-based hydrogels provide a potentially useful platform to deliver ranibizumab and aflibercept for the treatments of ocular diseases such as wet AMD, DME and corneal neovascularization.
4:::Liquid-base exfoliative cytology can be used to detect preclinical alterations in the oral mucosa. Patients treated with mechanical ventilation are vulnerable to infections, and oral care may be valuable in their prognosis.
4:::Almost three out of four children evaluated at the trauma unit were referred to the burns unit for further management. However, a large number of patients were treated and discharged from the trauma unit despite being eligible for referral.
4:::In a busy pediatric pulmonary clinic, while we successfully lengthened time between albuterol administration and post-bronchodilator testing in the vast majority of patients, no difference was seen in the percentage of patients classified as bronchodilator responsive. Results from this study appear to question the ATS/ERS recommended 15 min post-bronchodilator administration wait time for children.
4:::The mouth status, flow, and compliance were the 3 major influencing factors of PEEP effect, whereas performance of the 2 mechanical ventilators was slightly superior to that of the AIRVO 2 device at higher flows.
4:::miR-155 deficiency plays an effective role in attenuating liver IR injury likely by regulating the activation and inflammatory response, as well as modifying the polarization of KCs.
4:::Exposure of isolated human microvascular endothelial cells to marked hyperoxia for more than 24 h decreases cell viability and proliferation. Our results do not support a role of eNOS mRNA and protein or ET-1 mRNA in the potential vasoconstrictive effects of hyperoxia on isolated hMVEC.
4:::Awareness of what is considered design quality in relation to healthcare architecture could help to design healthcare environments based on evidence. To operationalize the concept, its definition must be clear and explicit and able to meet the complex needs of the stakeholders in a healthcare context, including patients, staff, and significant others.
4:::In T2DM patients with impaired liver function, canagliflozin may improve liver function, reduce HbA1c and body weight, and be well tolerated.
4:::CC17 SDSE harboring sicG might have spread into three closely-related prefectures in central Japan during 2014-2016. Clonal analysis of isolates from other areas might be needed to monitor potentially virulent strains in humans and animals.
4:::Ivabradine was effective and well-tolerated in CHF patients seen in clinical practice throughout 1year of treatment.
4:::Epidemiology of injuries in The Gambia is similar to other low-income countries. However, the magnitude of cases and issues uncovered highlights the need for a formal registry.
4:::We describe a method for the production of HEV ORF2 protein in N. benthamiana and the usefulness of this protein for the serological detection of anti-HEV antibodies in both humans and swine.
4:::As an alternative to repeat PK, EK after failed PK allows for potential reduction of the risk of graft rejection; however, it does not appear to confer a significant advantage in graft survival or visual acuity.
4:::In comparison to polyenergetic images, virtual monoenergetic images reconstructed from unenhanced DLCT of the head at 65 keV and 120 keV allow to optimize gray-white matter contrast and reduce beam hardening artifacts caused by the skull, respectively.
4:::The results from our ovarian cancer study suggest that adjunctive HIPEC proffers a significant progression-free survival advantage and a decreased risk for disease progression. There was, however, no overall survival advantage discerned by the HIPEC group. We also recognize that HIPEC remains controversial, and thus randomized studies evaluating HIPEC compared to standard chemotherapy in the management of ovarian cancer are warranted.
4:::Our findings suggest that rs149941240 polymorphism was associated with the risk of CRC, and might contribute to the susceptibility to CRC. The effects of this polymorphism should be validated in a larger sample and require further mechanistic investigations to determine the nature of its influence on CRC.
4:::HDTBR for 70 d induced peripapillary retinal thickening and cpRNFL thickening without visible signs of optic disc edema. The magnitude of such changes was not different between controls and exercisers. A slight IOP increase during BR subsided post-BR. Further study should evaluate whether different physical exercise paradigms may prevent/mitigate the risk of space-related visual impairment.Taibbi G, Cromwell RL, Zanello SB, Yarbough PO, Ploutz-Snyder RJ, Godley BF, Vizzeri G. Ophthalmological evaluation of integrated resistance and aerobic training during 70-day bed rest. Aerosp Med Hum Perform. 2017; 88(7):633-640.
4:::Our findings indicate that use of multiple measures of treatment adherence and persistence provides a more complete overview of medication use patterns, and certain limitations associated with DDD for some drug groups can be overcome with replacement by surrogate doses. The PDC indicator seems to provide a more accurate reflection of patient behavior and treatment continuity than the MPR. Any comparison of adherence/persistence should always consider the method used, variables analyzed, and corresponding data collection process.
4:::As compared to mothers who never smoked, early pregnancy smokers had infants with lower cord blood IGF-1 which could prime adverse metabolic outcomes. This provides further reason to support smoking cessation programs in women of reproductive age.
4:::When women present for FP on CHC, AFC may be suppressed. A CHC break of several months is associated with an increase in AFC and a potential improvement in overall egg yield.
4:::NAFLD rather than advanced hepatic fibrosis is independently associated with increased prevalence of chylomicrons+very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) remnants, VLDL, LDL and VLDL+LDL dyslipoproteinemias. ApoB dyslipoproteinemias may contribute to increased CVD risk associated with NAFLD.
4:::Using data from the South London Stroke Register, we found no evidence of a positive association between outdoor air pollution and incident stroke or its subtypes. These results, though in contrast to recent meta-analyses, are not inconsistent with the mixed findings of other UK studies.
4:::In this small retrospective study of adult patients treated for acute HIT, treatment with DOAC therapy was not associated with in-hospital thrombotic or hemorrhagic events.
4:::The results of this study show that grafting of intact post-extraction sockets using a biphasic in situ hardening bone graft substitute results in an effective preservation of the ridge contour and sufficient new bone formation in the grafted sites, which is imperative for successful implant placement.
4:::Focusing interventions on workload burden and factors influencing bundle difficulty may facilitate ABCDE bundle adherence.
4:::Q fever PCR from formalin-fixed liver tissues appears to be a useful adjunct for diagnosing Q fever hepatitis.
4:::Maximum tumor size, intrahepatic tumor distribution, and presence of PVTT were significant determinants of overall survival for patients with HCC and EHS. Transarterial chemoembolization may be appropriate for patients with EHS but lower intrahepatic tumor burden.
4:::The fragmentation pathways of DMEB charged species evidenced for singly charged aggregates exhibit features similar to that of other detergent aggregates, but multiply charged aggregates showed a system-specific behavior. QM calculations on the optimized structures (2(1+) , 3(1+) , 1(1-) and 2(1-) ) indicate that the most determinant interactions are due to an OH---Br hydrogen bonding that is also involved in the link between monomeric DMEB units. The MD models gave CCS values in good agreement with experimental ones, evidenced by a less strict reverse micelle-like structure and a reasonably spread bromine anion distribution Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
4:::These findings suggest that pushing technique influences stroller running speed and kinematics. These findings suggest specific fitness effects may be achieved through the implementation of different pushing methods.
4:::There is room for improvement in Estonia with medication adherence relating to all three aspects that determine adherence-initiation, implementation, and persistence. This means further efforts are to be made to educate patients and healthcare professionals on realizing the importance of good adherence.
4:::Results from UMBRELLA show that this novel study design is feasible and acceptable to patients in a clinical breast cancer setting. We invite researchers who are interested in conducting randomized or observational studies within the UMBRELLA cohort to contact the UMBRELLA scientific advisory board.
4:::Uninterrupted actigraphy is feasible and generally well tolerated by MICU patients and may be considered for future large-scale studies. Wrist and ankle actigraphy measurements of sleep and activity in this setting agree poorly and cannot be used interchangeably.
4:::Static and dynamic balance in pwMS appear scarcely correlated, although both worsen as disability increases. This implies that they should be separately assessed using specific tests to have a complete view of postural control performance in MS.
4:::Among patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 not on dialysis, the bio-intact PTH assay detected significantly lower PTH concentrations compared with intact PTH assay. Additional studies that correlate the diagnosis and management of CKD mineral and bone disorders with bone histomorphometric findings are needed to determine whether bio-intact PTH assay results are better surrogate markers in these early stages of CKD.
4:::We aim to detect a microbiota composition that predicts if patients with metastatic and/or irresectable colorectal cancer will respond to systemic treatment and/or experience zero to limited chemotoxicity. If we are able to identify a favorable microbiota composition, fecal microbiota transplantation might be the low-burden alternative to chemotherapy switch in the future.
4:::Combined with the gestational weeks data, the birth weight SD score may be useful to estimate the prognosis of HF patients with pleural effusion. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
4:::JETB showed high community engagement while offering opportunities for increased outdoor play in children. The intervention showed a significant effect on the number of children meeting the daily pedometer-derived physical activity recommendations.
4:::Mild laboratory-confirmed influenza infection is common in children during influenza seasons. Influenza vaccination is effective against ILI but not mild infection identified by surveillance.
4:::A high prevalence of NDM-1 genes encoding carbapenem resistance determinants was demonstrated among the K. pneumoniae isolates. Importantly, this is the first report of bla(NDM-1) carriage in a K. pneumoniae ST1383 clone in China and of a MDR CRKP isolate co-harboring bla(NDM-1), bla(KPC-2), bla(CTX-M), bla(SHV), acc(6)-Ib, rmtB, qnrB, and acc(6')-Ib-cr.'
4:::Dental care utilization and refraining from dental care for financial reasons clearly reveal associations with socioeconomic positions among adult individuals.
4:::From this survey, it is clear that relapse of disease has a negative psychological and physical impact, highlighting the importance of time without recurrence and the need for effective treatment in the long term.
4:::This pilot study indicates that 0.5% R348 JAK/SYK inhibitor ophthalmic solution is well tolerated and may have some therapeutic efficacy in treating ocular GVHD. Larger trials are required to derive more definitive data.
4:::Second-generation DAAs presented several advantages: virologic response values higher than the average achieved by previous IFN-based therapies, reduced treatment duration, and the possibility of different combinations of therapies to meet patient needs. Thus, IFN-free therapies appear to be valuable alternatives for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.
4:::Determination of sweat conductivity using Nanoduct™ cannot be recommended for four-day old newborns. However, at the age of four weeks the success rate is high (94%), and conductivity values at that age are comparable to older healthy children.
4:::A GRS predicts recurrent cardiovascular events in high-risk stable CAD patients. The observed effect was mainly driven by coronary revascularisations.
4:::Prescribers should examine the prescription monitoring program as multiple payment sources increase the odds of risky opioid therapy.
4:::Women with HGVIN/cancer should have cervical/vaginal cytology before vulvar surgery. Those with a negative cervical or vaginal cytology result should undergo cytology testing at 1- to 3-year intervals, based on the threshold for CIN 3+ set forth by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology.
4:::The concentration of IL-10, TNF-α, neutrophil and monocytes subtype count in blood is altered in patients with BD during euthymic state. The link between peripheral inflammation and different stages in BD deserves further studies.
4:::Our pilot study was unable to detect a beneficial effect of early administration of inhaled steroids on the clinical course of TTN in late preterm and term infants.
4:::Disease behavior or location was not different between younger and older adults with inflammatory bowel disease. Older patients were less likely to be treated with immunosuppression. If older patients have similar disease behavior, less frequent treatment with immunosuppressives may risk suboptimally controlled disease.
4:::Dot-like HHs on DWI can be observed without the typical symptoms of TGA. Valsalva maneuver-associated activities could produce asymptomatic hippocampal lesions. The symptoms of TGA may be presented on a spectrum, from no symptoms to mild vegetative symptoms or to the typical symptoms of TGA, depending on individual susceptibility.
4:::This study provides further evidence confirming the worldwide overuse of prescription medications for BPD and shows that there has been a shift in the prescription pattern in the last 15 years. These results suggest that real clinical practice only partially adheres to clinical treatment guidelines.
4:::Coffee consumption was associated with some positive effects on the respiratory system. There was however limited available evidence, mostly from cross sectional and retrospective studies. The only prospective cohort studies were those reporting on respiratory mortality. These results suggest that coffee consumption may be a part of a healthy lifestyle leading to reduced respiratory morbidity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
4:::This is the first treatment study for misophonia. Our results suggest that CBT is effective in half of the patients.
4:::In eyes with early glaucoma, mGCIPL change is frequently detected before corresponding pRNFL change. This could be the result of a superior sensitivity of mGCIPL deviation map that allows detection of an abnormality in the mGCIPL thickness earlier. In this light, OCT pRNFL analysis alone likely would overlook macular damage. Macular OCT imaging should be included in the imaging algorithm for the serial observation of patients with glaucoma.
4:::A diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome should be aggressively pursued in patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of autonomic nervous system impairment. Although the spectrum of adrenergic failure is variable, ranging from orthostatic hypotension to an excessive postural tachycardia, most patients do have symptoms of more generalized autonomic failure. Patients who were treated with immune-modulating therapy did improve.
4:::IV thrombolysis in CRAO seems to be safe and effective within the first 4.5 hours of symptom onset. A clinical decision based on this meta-analysis alone cannot be made due to several limitations. A randomized controlled clinical trial of early IV alteplase administration in CRAO is necessary to provide evidence-based therapeutic guidance.
4:::Combination SNS and TNS induced a superior inhibitory effect on bladder overactivity in pigs compared to single stimulation and thus could be a novel treatment modality for OAB.
4:::Low temperature might be one risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke and hypertension may be one effect modifier of this association in Jinan, China.
4:::Although LS-IVCM has a high specificity for diagnosing filamentous fungal keratitis, its sensitivity is moderate and highly dependent on the level of the observers experience and training with this imaging modality.'
4:::Cyclosporine had the highest response rate at 6 months in children with standard-treatment-refractory AIH; however, it also had the highest rate of adverse events. MMF was the second most efficacious option with a low adverse effect rate.
4:::Similar proportions of older, vulnerable aged ≥65 years patients with type 2 diabetes achieved/maintained glycaemic treatment goals without clinically significant hypoglycaemia with Strategies A or B. However, Strategy-A resulted in lower risk of total, documented symptomatic, and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia. These results identify an approach of potential clinical benefit in this age group and will inform future clinical research in older patients with type 2 diabetes. This trial is registered with ClinTrials.gov, number NCT02072096.
4:::(1) The prevalence of MKRN3 mutations in our cohort was similar to that reported in the literature in sporadic cases but lower than previously described in familial ones. This could be due to different inheritance patterns of families studied; (2) we expanded the phenotype of MKRN3 defects describing 3 more patients with MKRN3 mutations; and (3) point mutations in DLK1 and KCNK9 at least do not seem to be a common cause of CPP in girls.
4:::We did not find evidence for an increased likelihood of LTSA among multiple job holders. Future research should study the likelihood of LTSA among subgroups of multiple job holders, e.g. those working long hours.
4:::These novel findings indicated that blockade of MMP-2 and -9 could inhibit lymphangiogenesis. Further investigation of this factor may provide novel therapies for transplant rejection and other lymphatic disorders.
4:::PSC thickness did not significantly evolve with age in young males (≤45 years) but it decreased from age 45 years onwards. On the other hand, PCS thickness increased with age in women until the age of 45 years and it did not significantly change in older females.
4:::Current antibiotic therapy for BU is highly successful in most patients but it may be possible to abbreviate treatment to 4 weeks in patients with a low initial bacterial load. On the other hand persistent infection contributes to slow healing in patients with a high bacterial load at baseline, some of whom may need antibiotic treatment extended beyond 8 weeks. Bacterial load was estimated from a single sample taken at baseline. A better estimate could be made by taking multiple samples or biopsies but this was not ethically acceptable.
4:::Using DTI, widespread occult damage was demonstrated in the NAWM of patients with NMOSD. However, the NAWM was less affected in patients with NMOSD than it was in patients with MS; specifically, the axonal injuries and diffusion abnormalities in the association fibers were more severe in patients with MS than they were in patients with NMOSD.
4:::The presented technique holds promise of being a relatively easy to perform, predictable and well-controlled alternative for achieving a type 1 bubble during DALK surgery. The trypan-blue-stained viscoelastic device facilitates proper visualization and control of the separation bubble and assists in identifying the penetrance to the separation bubble prior to removal of the stromal cap.
4:::The reported pica practice among mothers and their children was lower than what has been observed in other studies. Knowledge and perceptions regarding pica were mostly inaccurate. Education on pica and associated dangers of its practices should be included in nutrition interventions in communities with known high anemia prevalence.
4:::The prefabricated triple-cut cutting guides make changing the dimensions of bony resection, while still using the prefabricated CAD-CAM reconstructive plate, possible.
4:::Aromatherapy is a viable intervention for improving insomnia and other symptoms commonly experienced by patients with acute leukemia.
4:::A significant portion of US readmissions occur at different hospitals with implications for continuity of care, quality metrics, cost, and resource allocation. Home health care reduces the likelihood of nonelective readmission to a different hospital. Infection was the most common reason for readmission, with ramifications for outcomes research and quality improvement.
4:::This meta-analysis demonstrates that the use of fibrin-thrombin sealant patches significantly reduces the total volume of lymph drained, the duration of the drainage, the incidence of lymphocele and symptomatic lymphocele, and the need for postoperative percutaneous drainage procedures. Its use does not affect the incidence of wound or lymphocele infections.
4:::Female gender and severe hand tremor may increase the odds of head and/or voice tremor in essential tremor. The association of hand tremor severity with midline tremor is stronger for males than females.
4:::Plerixafor, in combination with high-dose cytarabine and etoposide, was well tolerated in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory acute leukemias and MDS. While biologic responses were observed, clinical responses in this heavily pretreated cohort were modest.
4:::Treat-and-extend intravitreal therapy with aflibercept may be effective for improving BCVA and exudative change in eyes with PCV. The regression of polypoidal lesions after the loading phase and thicker choroid at baseline might lead to fewer total number of intravitreal injections of aflibercept.
4:::The 10-item ENLIST ENL Severity Scale is the first valid, reliable and responsive measure of ENL severity and improves our ability to assess and compare patients and their treatments in this severe and difficult to manage complication of leprosy. The ENLIST ENL Severity Scale will assist physicians in the monitoring and treatment of patients with ENL. The ENLIST ENL Severity Scale is easy to apply and will be useful as an outcome measure in treatment studies and enable the standardisation of other clinical and laboratory ENL research.
4:::These preliminary findings suggest that for patients treated with FOLFIRINOX as a first-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the immunohistochemical evaluation of MGMT could not predict the clinical outcome; however, the survival was not significant probably because of the under-powered study (due to small sample size). A strong tumor expression of p53 is associated with a poor prognosis of OS.
4:::Management of severe bleeding in patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants appears to be complex. The use of prothrombin complex concentrates differs depending on bleeding sites and direct oral anticoagulant plasma concentrations. Mortality differs according to bleeding sites and was similar to previous estimates.
4:::Our findings suggest that Lcn2 expression can be exploited to enhance the survivability of probiotic bacteria during inflammation, which could further improve its efficacy to treat experimental colitis.
4:::Future strategies should focus on positively influencing social norms to support recommended practices, and emphasize the specific reasons behind the recommendations. Future efforts should take a multi-pronged approach using a variety of influences, not only directed at healthcare providers but close family members, including fathers.
4:::Patients with inadequate health literacy, adverse drug events, or medical comorbidities had higher rates of non-adherence with alendronate treatment after sustaining a DRF. Further research is needed to show whether improvements in patient comprehension via informational intervention in patients with a DRF will improve adherence to osteoporosis treatment.
4:::Personality traits, job satisfaction and the way End-of-Life care is practiced influence burnout in the ICU.
4:::The presence of OSA and sleep fragmentation may induce changes in branched-chain amino acid metabolism in snoring children, independently of obesity. These data may suggest a new mechanism linking OSA and glucose homeostasis.
4:::In this series of five ADCY5 mutation carriers, perioral twitches and truncal jerks do not represent myokymia. In view of characteristic clinical signs and electrophysiological patterns with a combination of myoclonus and chorea it might be preferable to refer to these phenomena as myoclonus-chorea.
4:::The CHX substantivity on human dentine is lowest when using reciprocating compared to manual and rotary instrumentation.
4:::This study showed that symptoms of anxiety and depression in people with CRDs were significantly related to lower exercise tolerance levels and higher levels of disease impact. People with increased levels of anxiety and depression have the potential to significantly improve disease impact outcomes post-PR. The results demonstrated that the detection and treatment of anxiety and depression symptoms in people with CRDs are likely to be clinically important.
4:::Our results clearly indicate that primary aldosteronism is dramatically underdiagnosed and undertreated.
4:::ESS reliably predicts postoperative complications in ES patients. Such a score could prove useful for (1) perioperative patient and family counseling and (2) benchmarking the quality of ES care.
4:::This study analysed the specific attitudes, experience and education on pharmacogenomics of future users. There was a general positive attitude and interest towards pharmacogenomic testing. However, the grade of own experience, and knowledge about application and interpretation of pharmacogenomics caused uncertainty. Thus, education and training programmes may be helpful for implementation of pharmacogenomics at a homogenous level within Europe.
4:::Because early mortality was significantly higher in patients receiving endovascular treatment for proximal aortic disease, endovascular-based approaches proved to be feasible alternatives to hybrid surgical procedures, especially when they were performed for aneurysms located in the distal aortic arch. Whereas cerebral ischemia accompanies both surgical and endovascular involvement of the supra-aortic vessels, endoleaks and aneurysm growth remain hallmarks of endovascular supra-aortic repair. Because surgical revision had no impact on mortality, complete surgical debranching may become the option of choice for patients with good life expectancy suffering from proximal aortic arch disease, whereas total endovascular procedures could be particularly advantageous in patients with short life expectancy and distal aortic arch disease.
4:::This study in a regional hospital setting found a low evaluation rate for osteoporosis among patients presenting with a rib fracture. This study suggests that increased emphasis or education for osteoporosis evaluation may be necessary for physicians who are often referred to for care of rib fractures.
4:::The use of 50% oxygen during CPR results in lower cerebral oximetry values compared to 100% oxygen but there is no difference in brain tissue oxygen. Cardiac arrest disturbs cardiac mitochondrial respiration, but it is not alleviated with the use of 50% compared to 100% oxygen (Ethical and hospital approvals ESAVI/1077/04.10.07/2016 and HUS/215/2016, §7 30.3.2016, Funding Helsinki University and others).
4:::Most reviews had significant deficiencies in reporting the search process that raise questions about how these searches were conducted and ultimately cast serious doubts on the validity and reliability of reviews based on a potentially biased and incomplete body of literature. These deficiencies also highlight the need for veterinary journal editors and publishers to be more rigorous in requiring adherence to PRISMA guidelines and to encourage veterinary researchers to include librarians or information specialists on systematic review teams to improve the quality and reporting of searches.
4:::Decreased synovial fluid ghrelin levels are related to disease severity in patients with primary osteoarthritis and are increased following laser therapy. Local application of ghrelin may serve as an adjunctive therapy for knee OA.
4:::Overall patient satisfaction was strongly associated with perceptions of good communication and transfer of information. Confidence and trust in the clinical team is an important determinant of patient experience. Improving the ward environment by reducing noise at night may also improve the overall experience and satisfaction in emergency surgery.
4:::The reliability of the offline 2D-cUS cerebellar size assessments is good, and TCD-MF is the most consistent measure. Further studies should address the predictive value for the neurodevelopmental outcome of serial cerebellar size assessments by 2D-cUS for preterm infants.
4:::Our work shows that RanBPM, together with the CTLH complex, associates with HDAC6 and restricts cell migration through inhibition of HDAC6 activity. This study uncovers a novel function for the CTLH complex and suggests that it could have a tumour suppressive role in restricting HDAC6 oncogenic properties.
4:::The Systematic Review Competencies Framework provides a standards-based, flexible way for librarians and organizations to identify areas of competence and areas in need of development to build capacity for systematic review integration. The framework can be used to identify or develop appropriate assessment tools and to target skill development opportunities.
4:::This study found consistent and robust evidence for an increase in family planning methods over program duration as well as intensity of social franchise programs.
4:::Early gains in LE for NT Aboriginal people are consistent with improvements in nutrition, maternal and infant care, and infectious disease control. A rapid epidemiological transition followed, when LE gains in younger age groups plateaued and non-communicable diseases became more prevalent. Recent LE gains, across all adult age groups, are consistent with improved health service access and chronic disease management. If LE is to continue improving, socio-economic disadvantage and its associated risks must be reduced.
4:::In 2011, the age-standardized mortality rate for cancer exceeded that of CVD in both sexes in the UK. These changing trends in mortality may support evidence for changes in policy and resource allocation in the UK.
4:::(31)P MRS seems to detect active inflammation and advanced fibrosis in AIH patients. TE was ineffective in fibrosis quantification.
4:::The expenditure on opioids is a significant cost to Brazilian patients, especially given that the Brazilian Public Health System should dispense these drugs free of charge. Codeine was the most prescribed opioid.
4:::This pattern of echocardiographic findings confirms previous cross-sectional studies and indicates that subclinical changes in diastolic function occur more rapidly over 5years in RA patients than in the general population. Further research into the mechanisms of myocardial disease in these patients and the relationship with disease activity and treatment is warranted.
4:::After stimulation with LPA, HOK responded by regulating factors and genes that are essential in wound healing processes. As LPA is found in saliva and is released by activated cells after wounding, our results indicate that LPA has a favorable physiological role in oral wound healing. This may further point towards a beneficial role for application of LPA on oral surgical or chronic wounds.
4:::BSYSC could attenuate axonal injury and promote repair of axonal damage in EAE mice in part through the down-regulation of NogoA/NgR and RhoA/ROCK signaling pathways.
4:::Advanced, individualized planning and evaluation of their options for pain relief was most satisfying to women and enabled them to make an informed choice. This approach is consistent with the recommendations of clinicians who have successfully provided pain relief during labor to women with complex physical disabilities. Clinicians who have successfully delivered babies of women with these and similar disabilities emphasize the importance of a team approach where the anesthesiologist and other specialists are involved early on in a womans care.'
4:::Automated pupillometry in neurocritical care is a valuable adjunct to traditional invasive monitoring. Integration of routine pupillometer assessments not only improves accuracy of examinations but also correlates with ICP values.
4:::Lower DNA methylation at TREM2 intron 1 caused higher TREM2 mRNA expression in the leukocytes of AD subjects versus controls and may be a biomarker for AD.
4:::IDM improved quantitative accuracy of measured activity concentrations. Moreover, the use of IDM in combination with HYPR (Hypr-IDM-Hypr) was able to correct for PVE without increasing noise.
4:::ATs more commonly reported injuries that are easily diagnosed and treated (e.g., sprains/strains); EDs more commonly reported injuries with longer recovery times and rehabilitation (e.g., fractures). Although ED surveillance data can identify the most severe sports-related injuries, high school and college sports surveillance may better describe the breadth of sports-related injuries. Our findings may provide further support for school-based sports medicine professionals, but further research is needed to comprehensively examine the potential economic and health-related benefits.
4:::Th9 and Th17 cells may take the predominant roles in reticular and erosive OLP respectively, and their numbers were positively correlated in reticular and erosive OLP patients. Elevated circulating Th9 cells may help maintain immune balance in OLP immunopathogenesis, which requires further investigation.
4:::Urrets-Zavalia syndrome is a possible complication of TSCPC, as well as of other 360-degree thermal laser procedures.

4:::IBD significantly impacts daily life, including work, education, and social relationships. Treatment that addresses the full spectrum of life of a patient would be more effective.
4:::Individuals with CD exhibited higher serum levels of LPS varying from a 2- to 6-fold increase depending on disease activity, when compared with healthy controls. CD26 levels were lower in the CD groups. Both LPS and CD26 correlated with disease severity and serve as potential CD biomarkers.
4:::In this study, tooth condition and the use of anchorage devices are currently the main considerations by both orthodontists and laypersons when selecting the teeth to be extracted for orthodontic treatment.
4:::Sporotrichosis is the most common subcutaneous mycosis in Peru, with a high disease burden in Apurimac. Chromoblastomycosis, lobomycosis, and subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis are rare mycoses in Peru.
4:::The prevalence of jaw changes is higher in individuals with SCA.
4:::Decreased flow and shear stress in valve-in-valve procedures indicate a higher risk of leaflet thrombosis secondary to flow stasis, perhaps more so in the noncoronary sinus.
4:::U.S. seniors Match outcomes may be affected by applicant characteristics that negatively influence their selection for interviews, and their difficulties may be exacerbated by disadvantageous ranking behaviors.'
4:::Seniors without previously known stage B or stage C heart failure have moderate-to-severe DD, 27% of whom were stage C. Identifying seniors with DD leads to improvement in care.
4:::(18)F-5-FPN targeted small metastatic lesions with a higher target-to-normal ratio of uptake than those of (18)F-FDG, which suggests its ability to detect metastatic lesions earlier than (18)F-FDG. Further studies with a wide range of melanoma cell lines should be needed to confirm the similar performance.
4:::An early invasive strategy was safely done in an elderly cohort of Japanese patients with NSTE-ACS. In addition to early invasive approach, a further therapeutic strategy, most probably targeting a shock status, is needed to improve both short- and long-term survival.
4:::Ephedrine treatment for hypotension during DIEP flap cases is associated with decreased intraoperative flap complication rates compared with controls who did not receive vasopressors, whereas phenylephrine has no significant association. The common clinical practice of complete abstinence from vasopressors out of concern for worsening DIEP flap outcomes is not supported by this study.
4:::These hypotheses must be taken with caution especially because the heterogeneity of the results of the studies reviewed does not allow for a definite answer about the role of PG in affective disorders. Therefore, larger longitudinal studies investigating PG volumes in BD and MDD patients at the early phases of the illness, by considering females and males separately, are needed to further corroborate these findings.
4:::These results suggest that UCMS exacerbated the nociceptive response associated with dentin hypersensitivity, concomitant with an increase in plasma corticosterone levels. Hypothalamic and prefrontal cortex astrogliosis in the ED group may be attributable to the increase in corticosterone associated to UCMS procedure. The reduction of astrocytic GFAP expression in the hippocampus in the ED group supports the association between dentin hypersensitivity and depression.
4:::Almost all pancreatic cancers can be diagnosed by EUS-FNA. Furthermore, other clinical characteristics of pancreatic cancer undiagnosed by EUS-FNA were different from autoimmune pancreatitis undiagnosed by EUS-FNA. Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided FNA can be used to rule out malignancy in autoimmune pancreatitis patients.
4:::A thorough understanding of treatment modalities is helpful in evaluating and managing metacarpal fractures. Although the current literature supports a wide array of treatment strategies, high-level evidence to guide fracture management remains lacking.
4:::Our device will be quite useful for long-term EEG recording and drug application in moving mice.
4:::Frailty is a strong and independent prognostic factor for midterm all-cause mortality in elderly patients presenting with ACS.
4:::The V-V laxity in the isolated ACL-deficient knee was greater than that in the intact knee. The increased laxity was attenuated and approached that in the intact knee by adding posterior tibial load. Application of posterior tibial load is necessary for accurate assessment of V-V instability in the ACL-deficient knee. Clinically, the V-V laxity in the combined ACL-MCL or ACL-LCL injured knee may be overestimated without posterior tibial load.
4:::This is the first study to demonstrate that clinically detected AF focal and rotational sources in the left atrium often colocalize with regions of autonomic innervation. Studies should define if the role of AF sources differs by their anatomical location.
4:::In a prospective study of individuals who underwent screening colonoscopy within a National Colorectal Cancer Screening Program, we associated increased ADR with a reduced risk of interval colorectal cancer and death.
4:::This study demonstrates an acceptable occurrence of MI, death, repeat intervention, and stent thrombosis in a high-risk group of V. Eld. patients with de novo lesions. Age alone in the absence of other non-cardiac factors should not prohibit a patient from access to PCI.
4:::This study suggests that plasma concentrations of ABC, DRV, and RAL can be estimated from their saliva concentrations and that the saliva concentration of some antiretroviral drugs reflects the unbound drug concentration in plasma. .
4:::TAP-ANV and ANV-6L15 can specifically localize to balloon injured carotid arteries after i.v. bolus injections, resulting in substantial attenuation of intimal hyperplasia without inducing a state of systemic hypo-coagulation.
4:::Evidence shows that the PCMH model can increase health outcomes among low-income populations. However, limitations to quality include no assessment for confounding variables. Implications are discussed.
4:::The aim of gallstone ileus treatment is to release the obstruction, which is done through enterolithotomy. It is the recommended technique for gallstone ileus management because of its lower morbidity and mortality, compared with the other techniques.
4:::Fourier decomposition of posterior Keratometric data provides parameters with high accuracy in differentiating SKC from normal corneas and should be included in the prompt diagnosis of KC.
4:::Early detection and treatment of breast cancer might be effective for decreasing the economic burden, because costs escalate as the degree of malignancy increases.
4:::The use of short wavelength-blocking glasses at night increased subjectively measured sleep quality and objectively measured melatonin levels and sleep duration, presumably as a result of decreased night-time stimulation of ipRGCs. Alterations in the ipRGC-driven pupil response suggest a shift in circadian phase. Results suggest that minimising short wavelength light following sunset may help in regulating sleep patterns.
4:::Although search filters can facilitate the identification of research evidence to enable decision making, variability in study abstracting and indexing can limit the generalizability and usability of these filters. This potential for variability should be considered when deciding to incorporate a search filter into any literature search. This research highlights the importance of this awareness when developing strategies for searching the published literature and the potential value of supplementing database searching with other methods of study identification.
4:::This survey indicates that the majority of Nordic anaesthesia departments who manage anaesthesia for EVT are able to provide immediate 24-h response to an EVT request. Most of these departments have institutional guidelines for EVT anaesthesia and haemodynamic management. Conscious sedation appears to be the preferred method of anaesthetic care.
4:::Type 2 diabetes at least doubles the risk of anemia but other mostly modifiable risk factors are usually present. Anemia is associated with an increased risk of death after adjustment for other predictors.
4:::Autogenous premolar transplantation represents a safe method to ensure functional and aesthetic rehabilitation in the anterior maxilla irrespective of the nature of tooth loss.
4:::Inflammatory signals are detected, amplified, and propagated through the CNS via a sequential and reverberating signaling cascade involving communication between brain endothelial cells and glia. We propose that the brains innate immune response differs depending upon which side of the blood-brain barrier the inflammatory stimulus arises, thus allowing the brain to respond differently to central vs. peripheral inflammatory insults.'
4:::The incidence of MACE following VATS lobectomy in patients with CAD is low and similar to patients without CAD. However, their risk of postoperative mortality is fivefold higher compared with non-CAD patients, warranting refined preoperative functional evaluation and more intense postoperative monitoring.
4:::In this first report of rsfMRI conducted longitudinally across mood states, we find that previously observed between-group differences in amygdala connectivity are also found longitudinally within subjects. These results suggest resting state cortico-amygdala connectivity is a biomarker of mood state in bipolar disorder.
4:::The study reports high costs of treatment for both younger and older women than a non-cancer comparison group; however, the estimated excess cost was significantly higher for younger women. The financial implications of breast cancer treatment costs for younger women need to be explored in future studies.
4:::In Finland, male gender is significantly associated with both weekly gambling expenditure and monthly gambling expenditure related to net income. People in Finland with lower incomes contribute proportionally more of their income to gambling compared with middle and high-income groups.
4:::Parkinsons disease is associated with substantial physical and mental co-morbidity. Polypharmacy is also a significant issue due to the complex nature of the disease and associated treatments.'
4:::Automating the visual identification of bursts in preterm EEG is achievable with a high level of accuracy. Multiple features, combined using a data-driven approach, improves on existing single-feature methods.

4:::In this nationally representative population study, both MDD and GAD predicted greater functional disability in adults with diabetes. Social support, however, did not moderate these associations.
4:::Age, education level, self-management efficacy and health literacy were all related to the HRQL of patient with hypertension, which means that patients who are more elderly and have lower education level, low self-management efficacy and poor health literacy get worse HRQL. This may imply the necessary to introduce routine assessment of health literacy and self-management efficacy into assessment procedures for hypertensive patients health management. Such assessment can help professionals to identify the population at greatest risk for poor health outcomes and low well-being in the future. In clinical practice, effective interventions such as direct guidance and education to raise the self-management efficacy and enhance health literacy might improve the HRQL of patients with hypertension.'
4:::Lower levels of hBD-1, hBD-2, and hBD-3 in cervicovaginal fluid were detected in the presence of C. trachomatis infection.
4:::Patients with AS undergoing non-cardiac surgery have not been shown to be at increased risk of mortality, but have significantly higher rates of adverse cardiovascular events compared to patients without AS.
4:::The study shows that the intended benefits of gatekeeping were illusionary largely due to weak and worsening primary care conditions, and delay, ineffectiveness or unintended consequences of several other ongoing reforms. One particularly dangerous development of the system, which deserves urgent attention, is the harming of the professional prospects of primary care doctors. Our findings highlight the need for coordination and prioritization in designing policies related to primary care and managing changes with multiple on-going reforms. The approach used here facilitates comprehensive study of intended and actual mechanisms, and demonstrates the challenges of a complex health system intervention in a dynamic environment.
4:::Diabetes is an important co-morbid feature to be sought in patients with TB. This study re-echo the need to raise awareness on screening for DM in persons with TB.
4:::In conclusion, the present study is first of its kind on TNBC from northeast India, indicates that adipocytokines does play a role in TNBC pathogenesis. Thus, the understanding of molecular mechanisms of both leptin and adiponectin and their interplay in TNBC offer the prospects for new therapeutic approaches targeting similar signalling pathways.
4:::The preparation techniques resulted in the same level of accumulated hard-tissue debris. Compared to the other tested systems, BioRace was associated with more untouched canal areas, and Reciproc produced the greatest amount of removed dentine. Although it touched more of the root canal walls, the SAF system removed less dentine, whereas TRUShape had intermediate results for these same parameters. None of the systems tested were able to provide optimal shaping ability in oval-shaped canals. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
4:::These results show that a pattern of athletes interpretation of coaches' values is related to their own attitudes, much like with cheating and sportsmanship. This finding is consistent with the conceptualization of confrontation in general independent of sport.'
4:::Low serum albumin concentration (<3.5g/dL) worsens prognosis of patients with stable CHD.
4:::Although mean differences from 2-observer auscultation were acceptable, when tested on their owners, most home BP devices were not accurate to within 5 mm Hg. Ensuring acceptable accuracy of the device-owner pairing should be prioritized.
4:::Current best evidence suggests that OAT is successful in treating advanced OCD lesions of the capitellum and returning athletes to high-level competition. Evidence supporting the association between the size and number of grafts used and the time to osseous healing and return to sport is currently limited. Our assessment of the time to return to athletic competition was limited because of variable surgical technique, postoperative rehabilitation protocols, and outcome assessment.
4:::The health workforce is a key component of any healthcare system and is critical in improving health care accessibility. Strategies to increase coverage of health workforce at PHCs are crucial to achieving adequate levels of health services for DM patients. Allocation of health workforce should focus on PHCs in rural and low-income areas.
4:::The frequency with which the LN is excised during LC by the one surgeon is independent of the majority of clinical and surgical factors and may represent a surrogate marker of surgical technique. Whether this is related to the rate of bile duct injury remains to be determined.
4:::This survey indicates that in third-level headache centers in Italy OBT-A is used in good compliance with current recommendations. There is agreement about the definition of response as a reduction in headache days by 30% to 50%. Additional effort is required to define response to OBT-A and to establish optimal treatment duration.
4:::Emotional abuse and domestic violence are strong risk factors for major depression for females. Early intervention to prevent maltreatment and its consequences is critical, especially for girls exposed to poly-maltreatment.
4:::Although uveitis treatment was associated with increased vision and vision-related quality of life, patient-reported physical health did not change after 6 months of treatment, and mental health decreased. Despite improved visual outcomes, uveitis patients receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy may experience a deterioration in mental health-related quality of life.
4:::There is still a need for continued education of the general public regarding dental implants.
4:::Hysteroscopy therapy could treat persistent CSP effectively and safely after curettage treatment failure. Therapy should be individualised, and the risks and cost of the hysteroscopy procedure and anaesthesia must be considered and fully discussed with the patients before surgery.
4:::Desert dust episode days are associated with higher respiratory emergency room visits and hospital admissions. This effect is insufficiently explained by increased PM10 levels.
4:::The pvmdr1 gene might have diversified recently at regional level. In the absence of significant natural, genetic drift might have caused differential pvmdr1 haplotype frequencies at different geographic sites in Mesoamerica. A very recent expansion of divergent pvmdr1 haplotypes in NIC-NE/NIC-NW produced high differentiation between these and parasites from other sites including SMX. These data are useful to set a baseline for epidemiological surveillance.
4:::We replicate increased JTC in SCZ. However, acute intranasal oxytocin did not modify JTC. Future studies with larger samples should explore how brain morphology and SF are related to JTC performance in patients with SCZ.
4:::Prospective central pathology review of tumor histology should be integrated into future STS clinical trials. Doxorubicin-ifosfamide may be most appropriate for young, fit patients with poorly differentiated Grade III tumors including UPS.
4:::Root canal shaping with ProTaper Universal for Hand Use, HyFlex CM, and Reciproc systems, regardless of the working length, did not produce apical microcracks.
4:::Zirconia micro-implants showed initial stability and clinical applicability for diverse orthodontic treatments comparable to that of titanium micro-implants under compressive and tensile forces.
4:::Our results demonstrate that EAPPI MS can be regarded as a supplementary ambient method for the fast and comprehensive analysis of TCHMs, which is important for the quality control and safety assurance of TCHMs.
4:::Housing First programs in Canada are equally effective in people with and without comorbid substance use disorder (SUD). Overall, the intervention appears to be able to engage people with SUD and is reasonably successful at housing them, without housing being contingent on abstinence or treatment.
4:::This employer-based lifestyle intervention program was effective in reducing CVD risk factors after 1 year of treatment. Future studies should examine the effects of the intervention at 2 and 5 years to further assess long-term adoption of the lifestyle changes and maintenance of health promoted by this program.
4:::27-G vitrectomy requires longer operative time than 25-G, but using the 27-G system results in earlier visual improvement and stabilized ocular pressure.
4:::Our study describes the unique characteristics of squamous cell carcinoma of breast and demonstrates that it is an aggressive tumor with a poor survival. Older age and higher tumor or nodal stages at presentation were independent predictors of poor survival for loco-regional stages.
4:::The cobas plasma test detected the T790M mutation in 61% of tumor tissue T790M mutation-positive patients. To mitigate the risk of false-negative plasma results, patients with a negative plasma result should undergo a tissue test where feasible.
4:::The FRANCE TAVI registry provided reassuring data regarding trends in TAVR performance in an all-comers population on a national scale. Nonetheless, given that TAVR indications are likely to expand to patients at lower surgical risk, concerns remain regarding potentially life-threatening complications and pacemaker implantation. (Registry of Aortic Valve Bioprostheses Established by Catheter [FRANCE TAVI]; NCT01777828).

4:::Abnormal molar occlusion led to degenerative remodeling in the mandibular condyles of both juvenile and adult rats, while exemption of abnormal occlusion caused significant rescue of the degenerative changes only in the juvenile rats.
4:::About 10 years after BC diagnosis, the survivors generally comply with primary and secondary prevention practices.
4:::Expansive vessel wall remodeling was more frequent and intense with the BVS than the metallic DES and could be determined by patient baseline characteristics and periprocedural factors. The clinical effect of the observed lumen and vessel remodeling must be investigated in further large clinical studies to optimize the clinical outcome of patients and lesions treated by bioresorbable scaffolds. (ABSORB II Randomized Controlled Trial; NCT01425281).
4:::Combining the pSUVmax of each molecular subtype with the nodal (18)F-FDG uptake finding can improve the prediction of ALN metastasis in IDC.
4:::Despite abundant total MPs and MPs in immune complexes, β2 GPI-positive MPs were depleted in SLE patients and especially low among aPL/anti-β2 GPI positive patients. We suggest that anti-β2 GPI antibodies bind to β2 GPI-PS complexes expressed on MPs. Consequent loss of β2 GPI-PS expression on MPs may impair scavenging and contribute to accumulation of circulating PS negative MPs, a possible source of auto-antigens. Autoantibodies delaying MP clearance may thus constitute an important mechanism underlying autoimmunity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
4:::This study found that the craniofacial patterns of Korean children with snoring and ATH could be categorized into three characteristic clusters according to age groups. Although no significantly dominant sagittal skeletal discrepancy was observed, hyperdivergent vertical discrepancy was consistently evident in all clusters.
4::: Simultaneous ESD for multiple synchronous colorectal lesions is safe and feasible compared with single ESD and can reduce the burden to patients, length of hospital stay and medical expense. These results need to be elucidated by further studies.

(Efficacy and Safety of LCZ696 Compared to Valsartan, on Morbidity and Mortality in Heart Failure Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction [PARAGON-HF]; NCT01920711).
4:::The preoperative length of the ELM defect is the strongest predictor of visual acuity after MH surgery. Postoperative integrity of the ELM is significantly associated with visual restoration after surgical treatment of MH.
4:::The phenotype of SPS in Korean patients is different from that of Western patients. In Korean patients, SPS is more common in men, there were fewer total numbers of serrated adenoma/polyps, and the incidence of CRC was lower than that in Western patients. Korean patients tend to more frequently have abnormal gastric lesions. However, the prevalence of synchronous adenomatous polyps is high in both Western and Korean patients.
4:::Use of the AGREE II Instrument during guideline development did not have as great an effect on guideline quality as might be expected.

4:::A robust volume-outcome relationship was observed for deceased donor kidney transplantation, and low-volume centers are frequently in close proximity to higher volume centers. Increased regionalization could improve outcomes, but should be considered carefully in light of the potential negative impact on transplant volume and access to care.
4:::Depression and insomnia, both individually and as part of an interrelated pathway, partially mediate the relationship between distress and QOL. Appropriate interventions to alleviate insomnia and depression may mitigate the negative impacts of distress on QOL in cancer patients.
4:::The attenuated expression and function of SK channels, which results in the increased UBSM cells excitability and contributes to DO, was discovered in PBOO UBSM cells, suggesting that SK channels might be potential therapeutic targets for the control of OAB.
4:::In the daily routine, liver enzyme values do not give an accurate picture of liver damage associated with ulcerative colitis. With the help of various specific parameters determined by us, we can estimate the background processes of the gut-liver axis alterations. The decrease in bile acid levels can be a predictive factor in ulcerative colitis. Our work highlights the need of non-invasive screening for liver diseases in inflammatory bowel disease. Orv Hetil. 2017; 158(26): 1014-1021.
4:::Conventional and low-dose hydro-CT may be a valuable non-invasive diagnostic method in the diagnosis of gastric tumors for patients who have contraindications to endoscopy or who are unable to undergo gastric biopsy.
4:::It is possible to intervene in classroom settings to improve the language comprehension skills of children with language difficulties. However, it appears that such interventions need to be intensive and prolonged.
4:::These findings indicate that negative appraisals and fear extinction did not interact, but had independent relationships with PTSD symptoms. Here we show for the first time in an experimental framework that negative appraisals and fear extinction play separate roles in PTSD symptoms.
4:::Very little is known regarding the active prevention of GIO. Our data indicates that denosumab can play a promising role in the treatment of GIO.
4:::The prevalence of malocclusion was higher among children with ASD. Posterior crossbite, increased overjet, and severe maxillary crowding were the most common malocclusion traits in these children.

4:::The centinel program is effective in reporting dysphonia although it is important to highlight the low declaration as occupational disease of the cases detected.
4:::The linkage of trial registries to their corresponding publications continues to require extensive manual processes. We did not find that the use of automatic linkage has increased over time. Further investigation is needed to inform approaches that will ensure publications are properly linked to trial registrations, thus enabling efficient monitoring of trial reporting.
4:::Elevation of a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap alone (ie, without injury to bone) decreases the amount and density of medullary bone surrounding the tooth and accelerates tooth movement. Due to its limited effects, elevation of a flap alone to increase tooth movements may not be justified.
4:::Sound patency assessed by sonotubometry using 7 kHz band noise could be useful to predict the morphological severity of patulous ET.
4:::Our study suggests that our performance in evaluating acute ischemic stroke patients within the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association suggested time window is reachable for prolonged periods of time.

4:::In acute asthma exacerbations, the present study showed that additional administration of oral montelukast resulted in significantly higher FEV1at 4 weeks and PEFR at 2 weeks and 4 weeks as compared to the standard treatment alone. These findings should be confirmed by conducting a larger population-based clinical study.
4:::Chemotherapy for NSCLC improves symptoms, nutritional status, and exercise capacity but worsens the antioxidant status.
4:::The most significant variables in the univariate analysis were connected by a common factor, potentially related to the overall development stage of the country.
4:::This study revealed that social frailty is associated with both cognitive and physical function among Japanese older adults. And social frailty status was also negatively associated with physical function. Further studies are needed to elucidate if a casual association exists between social frailty and cognitive and physical function.
4:::Long-term persistence with anticoagulation in patients with AF remains a concern, even with NOACs. Patients initiated to apixaban appear to experience better medium-term persistence compared with rivaroxaban or dabigatran.
4:::Claims data alone can be used to classify individuals as frail and nonfrail. The Claims-based Frailty Indicator might be used in research with large datasets for confounding adjustment or risk prediction. The indicator might also be used for emergency preparedness for identification of regions enriched with frail individuals.
4:::The evaluators were reliable at manipulating the selected software, achieving consistent volume and minimal cross-sectional airway measurements, However, Dolphin Imaging volumetric and minimal cross-sectional airway measurements did not correlate well with the nasopharyngoscopy-supported reference standard for adenoid hypertrophy assessment. Under these study conditions, volume and minimal cross-sectional airway used to assess localized adenoid hypertrophy with cone-beam computed tomography imaging based on automated measurements may not yield high-quality clinically relevant information about upper airway constriction related to adenoid hypertrophy.
4:::In patients who underwent transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, OSA was associated with higher rates of certain pulmonary and airway complications. OSA was not associated with increased non-pulmonary/airway complications or inpatient mortality, despite older average age and higher comorbidity rates.
4:::The impact of temperature on EDVDBs is U-shaped in Beijing, China which varies by sex and age. The temperature effect is independent from other meteorological variables and air pollutants.
4:::Fibrinolysis shutdown is common postinjury and predicts poor outcomes. Severe TBI is associated with sustained shutdown. Empiric antifibrinolytics for children should be questioned; thromboelastography-directed selective use should be considered for documented HF.
4:::The prevalence of RLS was higher among individuals with TTH than among those with non-headache. Some clinical presentations varied in accordance with the presence of RLS among participants with TTH.
4:::Renal lymphangiectasia can be diagnosed with CT scan and confirmed by laboratory tests. As it may be confused with other cystic lesions of kidney; proper diagnosis and exclusion of other differentials can be effectively offered by CT scan IVP, which can avoid unnecessary invasive treatment options.
4:::Results from this study suggest that both treatments are effective, however, adjunct use of clarithromycin to FMUD leads to better reduction of deep pockets and P. gingivalis at 6 months compared to FMUD alone ( Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02829983).
4:::Uniportal VATS is feasible, safe, and reproducible in the treatment of pneumothorax. Morbidity is similar to multiport VATS. The recurrence rate is comparable with best results after multiport VATS or thoracotomy. Patients were satisfied with the single small scar.
4:::Administering CSs in orthognathic surgery improved the regression of facial edema independent of the dosage used but did not influence neurosensory disorders.
4:::Identifiable digital correlates may serve as indicators of increased risk of violence.
4:::Digital monitoring of peak air leakage and patterns of air leakage were useful for predicting prolonged air leak after pulmonary resection.

4:::There was a correlation between CFQ, SSQ and 6MWT in CF. Finally; we believe that QOL surveys should assess the domain ""sexuality"" as well as physical performance tests.
4:::Although the prevalence of psychotherapy provided immediately before and after initiation of psychotropic polypharmacy has slightly increased in the past decade, it remains low among Medicaid-insured patients, particularly among adults. Reasons for variation in psychotherapy utilization across states deserve further exploration.
4:::Patients at three US eye clinics were strongly in favour of online access to ophthalmology notes and were optimistic this access would improve their understanding and self-care. Ophthalmologists should consider offering online access to their notes to enhance doctor-patient communication and improve clinical outcomes.
4:::The incidence of obstetric brachial plexus palsy has remained stable in recent years. The percentage of children who present sequelae at six months is significant. Prospective studies are needed to be able to establish the long-term prognostic factors of this pathology.
4:::Satisfactory surgical outcomes could be expected in these patients following subcutaneous transposition with excision of extraneural cysts and draining of intraneural cysts. Older age, smoking, and shorter postoperative follow-up were found to be independent risk factors for poor outcomes.
4:::This sequence represents a good candidate for ultrafast acquisition of myocardial T1 maps. Magn Reson Med, 2017. © 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.
4:::In a specialized breast multidisciplinary practice, immediate breast reconstruction did not significantly delay PMRT, compromise target coverage, or increase dose to organs at risk.
4:::The causes of OGI varied in association with age, with older people mostly incurring their OGI through falls and younger adults through assault and working with metal. Globe ruptures occurring after a fall often had a history of intraocular surgery. The initial BCVA is useful for non-ophthalmologists who are unfamiliar with the ocular trauma score to help predict the BCVA following treatment.
4:::Some quality measures assessing care for substance use disorders were significantly associated with patient perceptions of care. Results provide additional support for these quality measures and suggest that patient perceptions of care are an important outcome in assessing care.
4:::Adult dual eligible patients aged less than 65 years with behavioral health illness in the Medicaid fee-for-service plan had significantly higher rates of hospital admission and ED use compared with dual eligible patients without behavioral health illness at the largest urban safety net medical center in New England. Safety net hospitals care for a large proportion of dual eligible patients with behavioral health illness. Further research is needed to elucidate the systems-related and patient-centered factors contributing to the utilization behaviors of this patient population.
4:::The present results are consistent with the view that temperament plays a causal role in the development of symptoms of psychiatric disorders in children. Because temperament is malleable, interventions targeting the affective, attentional, and behavioral regulatory components of temperament may reduce psychopathology in children.
4:::Apoptosis was verified but no tumor-suppressing effects could be observed for iv and ip treatment with both agents in contrast to in vitro studies in our model. Establishing a successful ip treatment model for emotion and BTB14331 requires further studies.
4:::From the present updated meta-analysis of available studies on LM coronary disease treatment, there were no differences in mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke rate at 3-5years follow-up after CABG or PCI, but CABG decreased the rate of repeat revascularization and non-periprocedural infarction. However, at short-term follow-up, CABG showed higher rate of stroke and periprocedural myocardial infarction, but these effects attenuated over time. These findings merit further investigation at longer follow-up.
4:::Results support an association of apathy with hypometabolism in parietal regions commonly affected in early stages of AD, rather than medial frontal regions implicated in the neurobiology of apathy in later stages. Further work is needed to substantiate whether this localization is specific to apathy rather than to disease stage, and to investigate the potential role of AD proteinopathies in the pathogenesis of apathy.
4:::Commercially insured and Medicaid-insured individuals aged < 21 years with DS experience a greater number and prevalence of concomitant diagnoses compared with non-DS individuals. Awareness of these common diagnoses could help facilitate the optimal care of these individuals by the pediatric health care community.
4:::There was a significant relationship between the number and patient-reported severity of endometriosis symptoms experienced and hours of employment and household productivity lost because of presenteeism and absenteeism.

4:::The J-Valve system exhibits a convincing midterm performance and is a safe and feasible procedure with low perioperative and postoperative complications.
4:::Risk behaviors and social stress contribute to the risk for suicide above and beyond depression and should be assessed during routine primary care visits with adolescents. The Behavioral Health Screen can screen all these domains and thus assist primary care providers in assessing for both psychiatric and social stress factors associated with youth suicide.
4:::CRS accurately predicted HCC recurrence beyond MC in this international validation. Although the risk of recurrence beyond MC decreased over time, it never reached zero.
4:::Alcohol-dependent subjects present an inflammatory condition that is not dependent on alcohol consumption. An understanding of the changes in concentration of the various proteins considered here would provide insight into the physiology of withdrawal or dependence.
4:::In this large, real-world population, stable patients with HIV who switched from their first-line ART regimens had significantly higher health care costs than those who did not change therapies, suggesting that ART regimen changes may be costly and should be undertaken only when clinically warranted.
4:::Postoperative radiotherapy using cRT is strongly associated with improved OS and DFS in patients with pT3N0M0 TESCC. A multicenter, randomized phase III clinical trial is warranted to confirm these findings.
4:::The multi-slice CTA has high diagnostic value for lower gastrointestinal bleeding.
4:::Rebubbling for DMEK graft detachment may result in similar visual outcomes as in uncomplicated DMEK, when performed within the first 6 to 8 postoperative weeks. However, rebubbled eyes may have lower ECD, which may be attributed to additional air bubble trauma and/or selection bias through more extensive manipulation during initial DMEK or higher risk of graft detachment in more complicated eyes.
4:::The results of this research indicate that the harmful associations between weight discrimination and health-risk behaviors are not limited to behaviors related to eating and physical activity but extend to high-risk behaviors that may contribute to the association between weight discrimination and poor health.
4:::The Zitelli bilobed flap can provide good-quality skin coverage over the distal interphalangeal joint in a short period.
4:::Structural and functional damage of the PFC and temporal lobe are associated with subtle cognitive decline in PD, while functional enhancement of the MTL and POJ is involved in normal cognitive function of PD. In addition, the combined application of rs-fMRI and VBM analysis might become an effective means to investigate cognitive impairment-related GM abnormalities in PD-MCI patients prior to development of dementia.
4:::HD showed a more efficient performance in the rGT and DRT. Moreover, alcohol consumption enhanced approach behavior to reward-predictive cues, but sign-tracking did not predict the level of alcohol consumption. Taken together, these findings suggest that high levels of voluntary alcohol intake are associated with enhanced cue- and reward-driven behavior.
4:::Three minutes of acupressure was effective in decreasing pain intensity in athletes who sustained an acute musculoskeletal sports injury when measured on the VAS, but did not change anxiety levels.
4:::Demographic factors seemed to explain the association between air pollution and type 2 diabetes in this cross-sectional study. High-quality longitudinal studies are needed to improve our understanding of the association.
4:::A CT protocol that incorporates low kV settings with a personalized (BMI-adjusted) reference amplitude for tube current modulation and iterative reconstruction enables very low radiation exposure CTA, while maintaining good image quality and high diagnostic accuracy in the assessment of PAD.
4:::Although all qualitative variables of PVD are not consistently provided in echocardiogram reports, the inter-rater reliability of cardiologists evaluating measures of PVD revealed strong agreement, especially at 36 weeks PMA. We speculate that establishment of a protocol for echocardiographic evaluation may improve the identification of PVD in preterm infants.
4:::Routine assessment using miniprobe EUS did not increase the accuracy of predicting invasion depth, compared to CE. However, EUS could be helpful in the treatment decision-making process for EGCs with lesions having irregular surfaces, fold change, size >2 cm, or ulcer scar.
4:::Standard use of sunbeds compliant with the European Union standard induced a transient increase of 25(OH)D levels, whereas no change in well-being was observed.
4:::Fertility rates in HIV-positive women are stable in the context of generally decreasing fertility. Despite a decrease in HIV-exposed infants, there has been an increase in ART-exposed infants.
4:::The faster recovery of S100B, lower systemic lactate levels and favourable regional antioxidant response suggest possible neuronal cellular and mitochondrial protection by RIPC, whereas better cardiac index underlines functional effects of RIPC. The exact humoural factor remains unclear.
4:::Honokiol can attenuate CL diet induced NASH and the mechanism in which possibly is polarizing macrophages to M2 phenotype via PPARγ activation.
4:::Classification tree analysis survival models offer many advantages over Cox regression, such as explicit maximization of predictive accuracy, parsimony, statistical robustness, and transparency. Therefore, researchers interested in accurate prognoses and clear decision rules should consider developing models using the CTA-survival framework.
4:::PFASs were transferred from mother to foetus, however, with different efficiencies. The concentrations of PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFUnDA, and PFDA in foetal organs were much lower than the maternal concentrations. Furthermore, a significant correlation between the exposure duration and all of the evaluated PFASs was found. The health-compromising concentrations of these substances during foetal development are unknown.
4:::Ramsay is both reliable and valid (high correlation with the RASS and RSAS scales) in assessing agitation and sedation in adult ICU patients.
4:::This novel surgical technique using a free graft and braided suture for simultaneous coracoclavicular ligament and AC joint capsular reconstruction successfully controls superior and posterior translations after type V AC joint dislocation and minimizes the incidence of persistent postoperative AC joint subluxation.
4:::After accounting for sociodemographic factors, women undergoing mastectomies at safety net hospitals remain less likely to undergo immediate breast reconstruction. However, the differences in rates of reconstruction between safety net and non-safety net hospitals have narrowed over time. The availability of immediate reconstruction lessens the psychological trauma of mastectomy, and it is critical to continue redirecting federal efforts toward this valuable component of breast cancer care.
4:::Quantitative assessment by MTV rather than by SUVmax and TLG on PET/CT may be helpful for stratifying patients who present with peritoneal carcinomatosis from EOC, in order to implement the appropriate therapeutic regimen.
4:::Emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection based on our systematic approach demonstrated excellent early and late outcomes. The temporary aortic crossclamping during cooling decreased the operation time without increasing early and late adverse events.
4:::Domestic DESs showed the same safety as imported DESs in this real-world cohort. But, patients implanted with domestic DESs had a higher risk of revascularization than imported DESs.
4:::In this cohort, maternal urinary triclosan concentrations during pregnancy were inversely associated with infants birth weight, length, head circumference, and gestational age.'
4:::Complications from patients seeking aesthetic procedures abroad will continues to increase. Patients should be encouraged to undergo cosmetic surgery in the United States to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction and because it is economically advantageous.
4:::Prefrontal activation during walking is dependent on age and task properties and that older adults apparently rely more on cognitive resources even during usual walking task.
4:::Significant improvement in clinical outcomes can be anticipated after arthroscopic treatment of FAI in adolescents. From a limited sample of our adolescent population, the risk of cam recurrence appears low; however, further follow-up is needed to ensure this does not represent a biased sample of the initial population.
4:::The authors newly developed oxygen-sensing paint-on bandage exhibits a comparable trend in oxygenation recordings in a rat model similar to conventional oxygenation assessment techniques. This technique could potentially prove to be a valuable tool in the routine clinical management of flaps following free tissue transfer. Incorporating oxygen-sensing capabilities into a simple wound dressing material has the added benefit of providing both wound protection and constant wound oxygenation assessment.'
4:::Medicaid PT/OT use and spending are higher for children with more CCCs and those with DD because children with DD receive more specialized PT/OT.
4:::One in four patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis carried a diagnosis of submucous cleft palate. The authors found that abnormal speech and language development occurs in one in 1.7 patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, and that speech therapy for such abnormal development is warranted in one in 3.4 of them-a prevalence two to five times higher compared with the general pediatric population.
4:::Infant regulatory difficulties are associated with a higher risk of obesity at preschool age. Helping parents manage and respond to difficult infant behaviors before preschool may serve as a focal point for future interventions.
4:::Retrograde superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy for T2-4N0 tongue cancer provided good overall survival and local control rates and was effective for occult neck metastasis.
4:::The influence of glucose-lowering rate on cardiomyocyte apoptosis and TNF-α was caused by the p-ERK1/2 pathway. During the glucose-lowering course, the p-ERK1/2 pathway promoted cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and TNF-α secretion was related to not only osmotic pressure but also ERK1/2 signal pathway activation.
4:::Prolactinomas have predominantly inferior growth compared to nonfunctioning adenomas and are less likely to cause vision changes.
4:::The presence of RC in patients undergoing OER for IGBC is associated with poor DSS in both high- and low-incidence countries, even when R0 resection is achieved. Residual cancer defines a high-risk cohort for whom adjuvant therapy may be beneficial.
4:::Pediatricians must educate parents and patients on how to safely use technology to minimize the potentially harmful outcomes.
4:::This study demonstrated altered axial length and anterior segment morphology in former preterm infants, especially in the first years of life. In addition, we observed that preterm infants seemed to catch up, so that the differences in ocular growth in terms of spherical equivalent, astigmatism, and axial length decreased within the first 8 years of life.
4:::Routine use of retrograde techniques tended to increase the procedural success rate. Clinical results after three months were acceptable, but the complication rate was higher than for non-CTO PCI. Individual patient and lesion characteristics had a low predictability for procedural success. Therefore, clinical symptoms, objective signs of myocardial ischemia and procedural risk should be focus points in coronary chronic total occlusion treatment strategies.
4:::Nearly one in five patients developed HM after CDP within 6 months with a highly consistent pattern. A thorough preoperative assessment, combining CT scan and MRI with a delay of less than three weeks before surgery, appears essential. A routine systematic postoperative CT scan at 8 weeks is also required prior to initiating adjuvant chemotherapy. The type of surgical intervention does not seem to be a risk factor, although the risk of HM occurrence appears to be related to the lymphovascular invasion of the tumor and maybe its degree of differentiation, elements not assessable by imaging.
4:::Our results partially confirm previous observations, showing that early disruptions in the maternal thyroid hormone supply may be associated with ADHD symptoms in offspring. Our study adds that there is no evidence for an effect on other types of problem behavior.
4:::Afterload changes should be taken into account in the evaluation of RVFWS during PAH follow-up, with the relationship to PASP likely to be linear.
4:::Besides being the first study to evaluate adrenomedullin levels to elucidate the etiology of childhood ADHD as well as NO, significant differences was not found between the case and the control groups in terms of NO and adrenomedullin levels.
4:::Our study has demonstrated that rFOV-DTI could provide information of optic nerve damage in chronic LHON, and can serve as technique for detecting and evaluating pathological changes in the optic nerve in LHON.
4:::Findings support mail-based and other tailored interventions for weight loss in this population, with an emphasis on diet quality for breast cancer survivors and caloric intake for their adult daughters.
4:::A structured PA program reduced the risk of MMD even in older adults with extreme obesity.
4:::Our data suggest that HRV in REM sleep categorizes healthy subjects and depressed patients, whereas REM sleep-derived prefrontal cordance may predict the response to antidepressant treatment in depressed patients.
4:::In a non-epidemic setting patients who have previously had CDI and have a MUST score of ≥2 are at increased risk of C. difficile colonization and could be targeted for active surveillance to prevent C. difficile transmission.
4:::The OMT classification can be used to describe hand anomalies that may present in over 1,400 diseases. CulaPhen was developed to provide a (hand) phenotype-based differential diagnosis. Differential diagnosis formulation based on the proposed system outperforms the system in current use.
4:::Engaging pregnant couples in CHTC can have prevention benefits for couples with an HIV-infected pregnant woman, but additional prevention approaches may be needed for couples with an HIV-uninfected pregnant woman.
4:::AVP and CIMT can predict CAD burden in a robust way. AVP may emerge as an exquisite bedside tool to predict atherosclerotic burden and guide in implementing preventive therapy for cardiovascular disease.
4:::CF complicated with ABPA shows higher attenuation bronchoceles on CT scans of the chest. Systematic density measurements of bronchoceles could help to raise the difficult diagnosis of ABPA in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis. Larger series could confirm a threshold in HU which could become a new imaging criterion for the diagnosis of ABPA.
4:::Alcohol-dependent individuals should no more be considered as constituting a unitary group regarding their affective and interpersonal difficulties, but rather as a population encompassing a wide variety of socio-emotional profiles. Future experimental studies on emotional and social variables should thus go beyond mere group comparisons to explore this heterogeneity, and prevention programs proposing an individualized evaluation and rehabilitation of these deficits should be promoted.
4:::The subretinal delivery procedure in this study was associated with a high rate of retinal perforations (n = 13) and retinal detachments (n = 6). When cells were sequestered in the subretinal space, palucorcel was well tolerated and may be associated with improvements in visual acuity. Larger randomized controlled studies are required to confirm these results. Future studies would require a modified surgical approach.
4:::Biembolization seems to induce safe, reproducible and effective FLR growth before extended right hepatectomy, in patients with primary or metastatic liver tumour.
4:::Moderate-to-severe PTH can be expected after TBI in patients with mTIH and post-traumatic seizure. PTH occurs more frequently in patients with mTIH than in those without mTIH.
4:::The study indicates that 3D MR bone models may offer a feasible alternative to traditional CT-based modeling. A single radiological examination using the MR imaging would allow simultaneous assessment of both bones and soft-tissues, providing anatomically comprehensive joint models for clinical evaluation, without the ionizing radiation of CT imaging.
4:::The retained instruments adequately represent the ICFs activities and participation, and body function domains. Body structure and environmental factors were assessed infrequently. Adoption of these CDEs may guide clinical decision making and facilitate comparative effectiveness trials for interventions focused on LSS.
4:::The published literature on combat surgical workload represents the high end of the spectrum of deployed surgical experience. These trends in surgical workload provide vital information that can be used to determine the manpower needs of future conflicts in ever-changing operational tempo environments. Our findings provide surgical types and surgical workload requirements that will be useful in surgical training and placement of medical assets in future conflicts.
4:::The protocol of 90kVp-IR3 and 100kVp-IR1 yielded similar calcium detectability, Agatston score and image quality as the reference protocol, with dose reduction up to 60.6%.
4:::Unilateral tDCS is effective for improving JTT performance, but not motor sequence learning.
4:::It was possible to estimate TCA accurately from anterior corneal data with a new formula. However, application of both this model on keratometric data and of direct Pentacam measurements in a group of 40 eyes with TIOLs did not completely eradicate the refractive error in TIOL calculation. More studies comparing Pentacam TCA and refractive astigmatism are required.
4:::Our proposed method clearly reduced inter-scanner variability in SUVs. A digital phantom developed by QIBA would be useful for harmonizing SUVs in multicenter trials using SPECT/CT.
4:::Counterweighted single-leg cycling elicits lower cardiorespiratory and perceptual responses than double-leg cycling at greater normalized power outputs.
4:::Older adults in Ireland with MHD are more likely to smoke than those without such difficulties. They also experience higher rates of smoking-related disease, although smoking had no mediating and no consistent moderating role in these analyses. Findings underscore the need for attention to the physical health of those with MHD including support in smoking cessation.
4:::These results open the possibility to consider embryos coming from 1PN 2PB ICSI zygotes for transfer when no other embryos from 2PN 2PB ICSI zygotes are available and if a PGS diagnosis of euploidy is obtained. Confirmation of biparental inheritance is strongly recommended.
4:::Both NT and ALIT are resistant to VILI caused by OD alone, but when combined with a HDS, significant tissue injury develops.
4:::Our results suggest that Rb1 promote translocation of GLUT4 by upregulation of leptin receptors and activation of PI3K.
4:::The presence of two different isoforms in the myocardium close to the insertion of pacing is suggestive of a differential state-specific expression of A2AR in cardiac tissue.
4:::The vonoprazan-based triple therapy showed superior efficacy in terms of H. pylori eradication as compared to the PPI-based triple therapy. In addition, the vonoprazan-based triple therapy showed comparable tolerability and incidence of adverse events.
4:::Overall, preictal periods in patients with focal hippocampal epilepsy were characterized with patient-specific changes in univariate and bivariate nonlinear measures.
4:::Recently, there has been a decrease in the prevalence and incidence of RAS blocker co-prescribing. Reassuringly, overall co-prescribing reduced in line with recommendations, although there was a decreasing trend prior to this likely due in part to prior publication of the data used in the EU review. © 2017 Crown copyright.

4:::Collectively, the studies reviewed indicate that telephone MI is a promising mode of intervention in treating and preventing substance abuse. The effectiveness of other alternative modes (SMS-based MI, Internet-based MI and group MI) remains inconclusive given the controversial findings and a limited number of studies. By synthesizing the currently available evidence, this systematic review suggested that telephone MI might be considered as an alternative to face-to-face MI for treating and preventing substance abuse. Further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of SMS-based MI, Internet MI, group MI and other alternative modes. Studies with methodological rigor and incorporating MI fidelity measures have great potential to advance the understanding in this field.
4:::Although considered diversion, sharing B-MAT is normative among B-MAT patients. Assessing B-MAT patients attitudes about diversion may help identify patients requiring enhanced oversight, education, or intervention aimed at modifying attitudes to reduce their likelihood to share or sell buprenorphine.'
4:::We observed no significant difference in major vascular complications or survival between patients who underwent the PC-DP technique and those who underwent arterial SGP.
4:::PER seems safe in PWE with ID. It is better tolerated by PWE with Moderate to profound ID than PWE with higher functioning. Caution is advised when history of mental health problems is present. The standardised approach of the Ep-ID register UK used confirms that responses to AEDs by different ID groups vary between themselves and General population.
4:::It is possible that a considerable number of children unnecessarily eliminate food because of suspected FA.
4:::Incretin-based treatment in patients with T1DM may improve glycemic control and reduce insulin dose and weight without increasing the risk of serious adverse event, such as severe hypoglycemia, ketosis or ketoacidosis. The current evidence for the aforementioned adverse effects, however, is weak. A rigorous monitoring of these adverse events should be implemented in well-designed observational studies.
4:::The macrolide resistance rate of M. pneumoniae has risen rapidly over 2 recent, consecutive epidemics, and this has been associated with a prolonged clinical course and increased use of corticosteroids to treat pediatric M. pneumoniae pneumonia.
4:::The effectiveness of accreditation as a strategy to improve safety and quality was shaped by the attitudes and experience of stakeholders. Strengths and weaknesses in the accreditation program influence, and are influenced by, stakeholder engagement and disengagement. After several accreditation cycles, the sector has the opportunity to reflect on, review and improve the process. This will be important if the continued or extended engagement of practices is to be realised to assure the continuation and effectiveness of the accreditation program.
4:::The incidence of PPCM in Alberta, Canada was approximately 1/2400 births and was modulated by the presence of DM in pregnancy. The relationship between DM status and PPCM may be confounded by other vascular risk factors, including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. There were few maternal or neonatal deaths in the overall cohort, but they were numerically higher in the PPCM group.
4:::Anti-CCR3 antibody significantly reduced the severity of eosinophilic inflammation, mucosal injury, and diarrhea in a mouse model of food allergen-induced GI eosinophilic inflammation. CCR3 may be a novel therapeutic target for treatment of EGE and other GI eosinophil-mediated diseases.
4:::This study introduced a methodology for preprocessing and analyzing cancer data, using a combination of data mining techniques that could be a useful tool for other researchers and further enhancement of the cancer registries.
4:::Better segmentation results are acquired by the Hue-texture-embedded region-based model compared with the traditional region-based active contour in these five cases: chronic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and atrophy, low grade neoplasia, high grade neoplasia and early gastric cancer. In the future, we are planning to expand the universality of our proposed methodology to segment other lesions such as intramucosal cancer etc. As long as these issues are solved, we can proceed with the classification of clinically relevant diseases in ME-NBI images to implement a fully automatic computer-assisted diagnosis system.
4:::Through this research, GA confirmed that at least 12h of dialysis should be conducted for a week. The optimized schedules from GA indicated that evenly distributing the intervals amongst sessions is efficient, and that scheduling a session at the start and end of a week is optimal to overcome a long weekend interval. The theoretical optimal schedule of HD may help distribution of frequent dialysis and provide more schedule options to patients.
4:::Breast-feeding was not found to be associated with an occurrence of AD in young children. Rather, parents with histories of allergic diseases tended to prefer breast-feeding and extend its duration. To clarify the role of breast-feeding in the development of AD, a nation-wide prospective study is needed.
4:::The CAD system presented in this paper simplifies the daily work of clinicians and provides them with objective and quantitative volume data for prospective and retrospective analyses.
4:::Partners wanted to talk about their concerns with a non-judgemental professional. However, the majority of help-seekers wanted advice and assistance in problem-solving, coping and the process of seeking further help. Future studies need to examine the impact of online help-seeking by partners.
4:::The study established the therapeutic benefit of interviewer interaction in reducing risky behavior among this young drug using population. The study demonstrated the efficacy and acceptability of a low threshold intervention in reducing drug use, sexual risk and related co-morbidities among a not-in-treatment young adult population that exhibits severe and complex levels of drug use, but that is also highly resistant to intervention.
4:::Abbreviated behavioral counseling can produce clinically meaningful weight loss regardless of whether self-monitoring is performed on paper or smartphone, but long-term superiority over standard of care self-guided treatment is challenging to maintain.
4:::The results of this study suggest that a) stress related working conditions (Job Strain, Social Support and ERI) are relevant predictors of risky driving in BRT operators, and b) that fatigue is the mechanism which links another kind of stress related to working conditions (job strain and low social support) with risky driving. The mechanism by which ERI increases risky driving in BRT operators remains unexplained.
4:::This study suggests that functional changes and maladaptive cognitive processes are present in adolescents with neck pain aged 16-18 years old. These findings need to be replicated in future studies.
4:::Research is needed regarding differential relationships between lifetime anxiety disorder and current anxiety symptoms and hastened/delayed depressive recurrence/recovery - specifically whether lifetime anxiety disorder versus current anxiety symptoms has marginally more robust association with hastened depressive recurrence, and whether both have marginally more robust associations with hastened depressive recurrence versus delayed depressive recovery, and related clinical implications.
4:::Results suggest that LVSI remains a controversial issue in the management of patients with endometrial cancer. Acquiring a deeper knowledge and uniform criteria could avoid the risk of undertreatment and overtreatment in this group of patients with early-stage endometrial cancer. The identification of vascular pseudoinvasion is recommended, although the clinical and prognostic implications still need to be determined.
4:::Attention to spatiality can shed light on important aspects of teaching and learning practices, and on the professional identities these practices shape and support. New configurations of time and space as part of educational initiatives can surface new insights into existing practices and learning models.
4:::In our case IOP elevation, glaucomatous visual field conversion, and structural progression were accompanied with significant progressive decrease of peripapillary PAFD. The simultaneous thinning of RNFLT and GCC and decrease of peripapillary PAFD suggest that PAFD may potentially be an additional indicator of early progression in primary open-angle glaucoma.
4:::The reproducibility of peripapillary RNFL thicknesses acquired with OCT was excellent. The variability between OCT measurements did not decrease with the ETS activated.
4:::RDI <85% is predicted by patients age, febrile neutropenia and hypersensitivity reactions to taxanes. The incidence of febrile neutropenia in FEC-D treatment indicates primary prophylaxis with G-CSF following docetaxel treatment. No relationship was found between RDI and (disease-free) survival, but longer follow-up is needed.'
4:::Molecular profiling of MPE is a viable alternative to testing solid tissue in NSCLC. This study shows successful detection of genetic aberrations in 59% of samples with minimal risk of false negative.
4:::The statistically significant decline of standardized incidence of hip fractures from 2010 onward could at least in part be the result of the high increase in consumption of antiosteoporotic medicines which in turn is strongly negatively correlated with the average price of osteoporosis medicines.
4:::The presence of contextually related non-target items produces both positive and negative effects on ADL performance. These types of non-target objects might help to cue the retrieval of the action schema related to the target task, particularly in patients with MCI. In contrast, the presence of these objects might also lead to distraction in dementia and MCI. (JINS, 2017, 23, 481-492).
4:::Neonates with large vein of Labbé infarctions are more likely to have poor language outcomes. This finding suggests a need for targeted surveillance to ensure early identification of deficits and referral for intervention.
4:::For patients with a chronic left ventricular dysfunction, Dallas-positive histopathology, β-blocker therapy and left ventricular ejection fraction are the most striking parameters for outcome prediction.
4:::Collectively, our data suggest that LOX functions as a tumor promoter in HGSOC and positively regulates several aspects of the metastatic cascade.
4:::Based on these results, parthenolide might be a candidate agent for preventing NAFLD due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative potency.
4:::Percutaneous PS closure in infants and children is safe and provide regression in respiratory symptoms and heart chamber dilatation if significant shunt is present. MRI is able to define aberrant artery course and PS parenchima, and might represent a valid instrument to study residual PS parenchima during growth.
4:::Histologically nephrogenic adenoma may simulate a variety of malignancies. Awareness of characteristic morphologic features of nephrogenic adenoma is needed to diagnose this lesion correctly.
4:::This meta-analysis suggests that the introduction of moxifloxacin into the recommended regimen for the treatment of non-drug resistant TB improves the clinical outcome by elevating the culture conversion rate and reducing the recurrence rate.
4:::Treatment of M. abscessus resulted in short term improvement in lung function that is inversely related to pre-treatment FEV1.
4:::The results suggest the existence of a ""thermal comfort zone"" covering a temperature range from 10 to 20°C in which the frequency of severe hypoglycemia was significantly lower than below 10°C and above 20°C.
4:::Documented brief intervention was not associated with resolving unhealthy alcohol use at follow-up screening among VA PLWH with unhealthy alcohol use. Effective methods of resolving unhealthy alcohol use in this vulnerable population are needed.
4:::The results of this study suggested the A-E sequence had longer combined PSA and total PSA-PFS compared to the E-A sequence in patients with CRPC. LDH values in sequential therapy may serve as a predictor of longer combined PFS.
4:::Subclinical seizures were more common and mortality was higher for preterm than term neonates. These data underscore the importance of electroencephalographic monitoring and the potential for improved management in preterm neonates.
4:::These indices are effective methods to incorporate the influence of comorbid conditions in models designed to assess the risk of in-hospital mortality and readmission using administrative data with limited clinical information, especially when small samples sizes are an issue.
4:::Our risk-adjustment model demonstrated strong validity for predicting discharge self-care scores. Although the model needs validation with national data, it represents an important first step in evaluation of IRF functional outcomes.
4:::In addition to age and atrial fibrillation, PASP estimated by Doppler echocardiography could help embolic risk stratification in patients with HCM.
4:::In patients with moderate-to-severe IMR, the addition of MV surgery to CABG was not associated with increased perioperative mortality. Although concomitant MV surgery reduced recurrence of moderate-to-severe MR at follow-up, this was not associated with a reduction in late mortality. Larger trials with longer follow-up duration are required to further assess long-term survival and freedom from reintervention.
4:::The incidence of PME as observed by SDOCT was higher than previously reported after uncomplicated cataract surgery. Eyes with POAG were at greater risk for PME, which was mainly associated with perioperative PGA use.
4:::Patients with PTSD presented a worse RDC/TMD Axis II profile, more pain after periodontal probing, and no difference related to periodontal clinical parameters. More studies are needed to confirm these findings.
4:::This study observed significant relationship between substance use and HIV risk behaviors within partnerships. Specifically, when either the participant, the partner, or both used any drugs there was an increased odds of sexual risk behaviors. Findings suggest that partner-level substance use behaviors should be taken in account when developing sexual risk reduction interventions.
4:::Overgrown connective tissue does not necessarily block regenerating nerves and itself may not cause pain. The morphologic findings on the 3DAC-PROPELLER were relevant to the severity of pain symptoms.
4:::A smoking cessation program using varenicline or NRT for 3 months resulted in a decrease of CO, oxidative stress, arterial stiffness and restored endothelial glycocalyx. These effects were more evident after varenicline treatment, likely because of a greater CO reduction, and were maintained after 1 year only in subjects who abstained from smoking.
4:::We demonstrated an association between the morphology of IEDs and the type of the seizure-onset pattern in mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy.
4:::Six-month AEX+WL, and not WL alone, is capable of enhancing skeletal muscle fatty acid metabolism in postmenopausal African-American and Caucasian women with NGT, IGT, and overweight/obesity.
4:::Unbiased pathologist review of archival RP specimens supports absent metastatic potential for contemporarily defined GS6 CaP. Reduced postoperative monitoring is appropriate for pGS6, but may require pathology review to confirm absent Gleason pattern 4.
4:::These results indicate that EELs has antioxidant, antinociceptive and topical anti-inflammatory activities, supporting the use of this plant in folk medicine.
4:::In this post-hoc analysis, lurasidone was found to be effective in treating post-menopausal MDD patients with mixed features (subthreshold hypomanic symptoms).
4:::It was found that the personality traits of nurses had an effect on some conflict management strategies adopted by them.
4:::The low level of concordance with national guidelines for surgical management of melanoma resulted in overtreatment of many patients. However, a fifth of patients were undertreated, which is likely to have resulted in increased locoregional recurrence rates. The better concordance achieved by physicians treating >30 melanomas per year suggests that a minimum caseload threshold for physicians treating melanoma patients would be desirable. High guideline concordance will ensure patients receive optimal care and minimize morbidity and health service costs.
4:::This study suggests the need for a more individual BP management accounting for pre-treatment BP and the acute BP course (ie, BPV) to achieve best possible outcome for the patient.
4:::Among participants with diabetes, glucose peaks are a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia. Targeting glucose peaks, in addition to average glycemia, may be an important avenue for prevention.
4:::Ileostomy closure (<3 months) is practical and safe. It does not increase morbidity and significantly reduces the time patient has a stoma. This may be advantageous in regards to having a reduced possibility of stoma related complications.
4:::Even if HbA1c ≥48mmol/mol is a valuable diagnostic tool, it is a blunt and insensitive tool for screening and would exclude most people with T2DM, independent of ancestry and age. HbA1c is an inefficient way to detect individuals with prediabetes.
4:::The incorporation of BNNTs up to 0.15wt% improved the chemical and mechanical properties of dental adhesives and promoted mineral deposition.
4:::SETs of day 6 cryopreserved blastocysts resulted in similar clinical and ongoing pregnancy rates compared to day 5, particularly after vitrification.
4:::The Ilizarov method has a role to play in the treatment of simple closed Tibial shaft fractures in patients who need to kneel. Patient education is a priority however; the patient must be made aware of the difficulty rate associated with the Ilizarov method when compared to the complication profile of alternative treatments.
4:::These findings demonstrated that the combined use of lower concentrations of γ-tocotrienol and jerantinine A induced potent cytotoxic effects on U87MG cancer cells resulting in a reduction on the required individual concentrations and thereby minimizing toxicity of jerantinine A towards non-cancerous MRC5 cells as well as probably overcoming the high-dose limiting application of γ-tocotrienol. The multi-targeted mechanisms of action of the combination approach have shown a therapeutic potential against brain cancer in vitro and therefore, further in vivo investigations using a suitable animal model should be the way forward.
4:::The results of this meta-analysis provide evidence to support moderate standardized effects, with and without consideration of walking speeds, for changes in lower extremity kinematics, joint moments and powers at the ankle, and ground reaction forces. The standardized effects of age for knee mechanics are less conclusive and would benefit from further research.
4:::The presented algorithm shows a better performance and more robustness compare to most of existing methods, and shows power in extracting optimal features from EEG.
4:::The study demonstrated that the CHIARA system satisfies clinical applicability and efficacy criteria in the treatment of AHF, in terms of adequate fluid removal through a single peripheral venous access.
4:::High expression of CD44 and CD90 was associated with significantly reduced relapse-free survival in NSCLC patients. These results suggest that CD44 and CD90 may be important markers of tumor progression in NSCLC.
4:::Few studies have specifically studied ERAS interventions in ovarian cancer. All studies on protocols including multiple interventions were susceptible to bias. Early feeding is the intervention that is best supported by randomized trials. Application of evidence for ERAS derived from nonovarian cancer is challenged by the differences not only in the scope of surgery but also in ovarian cancer patients comorbidities. Postoperative morbidity is particularly high in these patients because of their poor nutritional status, perioperative fluids shifts, and long operating times. These patients may also show excessive response to surgical stress. Innovative, randomized trials are needed to reliably determine the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of specific ERAS interventions in ovarian cancer.'
4:::Biochemical verification was both time- and cost-intensive, and yielded a relatively small number of samples due to low response rates and use of other nicotine products during the follow-up period. There was a high rate of discordance of self-reported abstinence and saliva testing. Costs for data collection may be prohibitive for studies with large sample sizes or limited budgets. Our findings echo previous statements that biochemical verification is not necessary in population-based studies, and add evidence specific to technology-based studies.
4:::CI increases speech intelligibility and improves quality of life in patients with USH2a.
4:::A transcanal endoscopic infracochlear approach is feasible for the management of cholesterol granuloma. The surgical access was wide enough to introduce the endoscope into the petrous apex cavity in each case. Further studies are needed to compare the efficacy and perioperative morbidity versus the traditional postauricular transtemporal approaches.
4:::These findings demonstrate that pulsons applied bilaterally on the abdominal vagus reduced food intake as a consequence of the activation of the brainstem and higher-order brain areas.
4:::A large proportion of patients seen for the chief complaint of dizziness in the neurotology clinic were found not to have a peripheral etiology of their symptoms. These data challenge a prevalent dogma that the most common causes of dizziness are peripheral: BPPV, vestibular neuritis, and Ménières disease. Age and sex are statistically significant predictors of peripheral etiology of dizziness.'
4:::Addition of bza to E2-treatment blocks E2-induced uteroproliferation but does not alter E2-mediated effects on thymus, B lymphopoiesis or B cell function.
4:::There is good evidence supporting the use of rifaximin as a chemoprophylactic agent against travellers diarrhoea, especially in individuals who are at high risk of severe complications from acute infectious diarrhoea. Rifaximin has an excellent tolerability/safety profile and demonstrated efficacy against diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli and even enteroinvasive bacteria such Campylobacter species. Future studies should study the most effective dosing regimen for rifaximin chemoprophylaxis, as well as profile local antimicrobial resistance/susceptibility data in less developed regions to further guide rifaximin use.'
4:::Negative opinions about the school meals policy consistently outnumbered positive ones. The findings discovered the publics opinions for policy improvement, contributed to the evidence base of health benefits for policy promotion and community collaboration, and revealed interesting gender and regional differences in the opinions. The social media analytics offers significant methodological implications for discovering the public opinions on food policies.'
4:::In young, asymptomatic individuals, self- or clinician-administered sustained mobilizations reduced activity levels of most scapular and shoulder muscles during shoulder abduction. This effect was observed only while the sustained glides were applied to the shoulder. At the immediate follow-up, muscle activity levels were similar to baseline measurements.
4:::The heat map facilitated easy-to-implement semi-quantitative visualization of increasing LOS through the SAPSIIs and number of ISs.
4:::Caregivers value interactive interventions that are tailored to their unique needs and the illness context. However, usage of the interventions was sporadic and declined over time, indicating that future interventions should address stage-specific needs across the caregiving trajectory. A systematic review has the potential to be conducted given the consistency in caregiver burden and depression as outcomes.
4:::Near real-time automated SOFA scoring was found to have strong agreement with manual score calculation and may be useful for the detection of sepsis utilizing the new SEPSIS-3 definition.
4:::Depression appears to affect men more seriously than women after acute phase treatment. Men had a younger age at onset and the first onset age, higher education, more functional impairment and lower satisfaction of quality of life in mood, work and sexual life. Gender differences affect acute treatment, remission and recovery.
4:::Reactive oxygen species may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of these common brain tumors. As the processes at the molecular level understood, targeted-treatment adjunct to surgical removal will be possible to cope with these devastating brain tumors.
4:::We demonstrated that propofol could attenuate TNF-α-induced HT22 apoptosis. More importantly, we indicated that the underlying mechanism may involve iNOS/NO, Ca(2+) and mitochondrial dysfunction.
4:::A pressure-dependent maintenance effect of the visual field was confirmed in progressive normal-tension glaucoma.
4:::Our review highlights the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of social media interventions for smoking cessation. Future research should continue to explore approaches for promoting user engagement and retention, and whether sustained engagement translates to clinically meaningful smoking cessation outcomes.
4:::Morse taper implant joints revealed a proper biomechanical behavior when compared to external hexagon systems concerning a significant volume of surrounding peri-implant bone subjected to lower stresses values.
4:::The findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of a BCI-driven neurorehabilitation approach using the unaffected hemisphere in this uncontrolled sample of chronic stroke survivors. They also demonstrate that BCI-driven neurorehabilitation can be effectively delivered in the home environment, thus increasing the probability of future clinical translation.
4:::These results support the hypothesis that intratumoral drug distribution following IP treatment is diffusion-controlled. An implanted device that continuously delivers low doses of IP chemotherapy would, therefore, be maximally effective against microscopic tumors.
4:::Our findings indicate that intestinal L cells are responsive to PANDER, and elevated PANDER levels impair GLP-1 production in vitro and in vivo.
4:::Associations with body mass index and asthma found by previous studies may be consequences of bipolar disorder or its treatment rather than risk factors. Inverse associations with all the outcome diagnoses for stress resilience, muscular strength and cognitive function may reflect general risks for these psychiatric disorders or intermediary factors.
4:::Painful loosening and capitellar instability are the primary reasons for surgical re-intervention with or without implant removal. Midterm clinical results are favourable despite an elevated rate of degenerative lesions after surgical re-intervention with implant retention.
4:::This paradigm forced a choice between immediate drinking reward and delayed monetary reward. In those with high impulsivity and/or low self-control, aripiprazole shifts the balance away from immediate drinking toward a later reward. Medications targeting cortical dopamine/serotonin balance might show clinical benefit of reduced drinking, among individuals with impulsivity/low self-control.
4:::The results show that the prevalence of anxiety throughout the lifespan is noticeable in people over 50 years, and should be taken into account, especially in the female population and in those with chronic diseases.
4:::32 months after surgical re-fixation of the distal biceps brachii tendon rupture, strength in all exercises is marginally reduced in comparison to the opposite arm. Re-fixation of the distal biceps brachii tendon is an adequate method to return the range of motion and the strength in the elbow joint to an almost normal level and that gives rise to a high level of patient satisfaction.
4:::Although neck failure after END can occur, SOHND is appropriate for END for OSCC. For tongue carcinoma, level IV dissection is recommended, and for tumors close to the midline, contralateral neck dissection is also recommended.
4:::Knowledge of Kommerells diverticulum presence and morphology as well as the LASA course during preinterventional work-up of patients with congenital heart defects is critical, since it may have surgical implications during corrective procedures.'
4:::Although CFTR modulator therapies provide hope for improving clinical outcomes, worsening depression and anxiety occurs in some patients when starting these novel agents. This phenomenon may be multifactorial, with hypothesized contributions from CFTR modulator-psychotropic medication interactions, direct effects of CFTR modulators on central nervous system function, the psychologic effect of starting a potentially life-altering drug, and typical triggers of depression and anxiety such as stress, pain, and inflammation. The medical and psychiatric complexity of many individuals with CF warrants more direct involvement of mental health specialists on the multidisciplinary CF team. Inclusion of mental health variables in patients with CF registries will facilitate further examination at an epidemiologic level.
4:::It is feasible to establish a regional glaucoma physician collaborative to improve standardization of care for patients with newly diagnosed POAG.
4:::The brain structural network is significantly disrupted in SVD+D and the impairment is related to severity of vascular damages and depressive symptoms. The study provides evidence for the role of structural network damage in SVD-related depressive symptoms and might be a potential novel disease marker for SVD and comorbid depression.
4:::This study provides evidence that different types of social support were associated with variations in the utilization of cancer screenings. Future longitudinal studies are needed to explore the causal relationship between social support and cancer screening use.
4:::Patients managed with surgery demonstrated improved survival on unadjusted analysis. However, on multivariate analysis that included the imaging extent of disease, surgery was not associated with outcome, which highlights the importance of patient selection and the need for additional research to identify variables critical for treatment selection.
4:::Culturally and linguistically isolated populations like Chinese older women are at risk of exclusion from advancements in precision medicine. Our findings provide cultural insights for tailoring interventions for Chinese older women to increase knowledge, change attitudes, and increase intention and participation in biospecimen research. We also highlight the need for individual, family, and community level interventions to promote healthy aging among Chinese older women.
4:::Combined interventions of large-scale antiviral ring prophylaxis and treatment and public health control measures could be applied to reduce the magnitude of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 outbreaks in closed settings.
4:::Induced membrane technique for the treatment of tibial osteomyelitis defects, seems a reliable method. The use of reconstructive locked plate as a temporary internal fixation at the first stage and exchanged with intramedullary nail at the second stage, potentially achieves good clinical efficacy. Care should be taken to restore the joint function especially in distal tibia.
4:::Findings from this study suggested that greater levels of PF impairment were associated with lower risk of EM among U.S. Chinese older adults in the Greater Chicago Area. Longitudinal studies are needed to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the pathways between PF and EM and its subtypes among Chinese aging populations.
4:::The results of this study, while not clearly supporting associations with these obesity-related hormones, suggest that the association between obesity and RCC may be partially modified through mechanisms related to elevated IGFBP-3.
4:::Overall, older immigrants with greater coping resources seemed to have less family and marital conflict. Particularly important are their own sense of control and available support from children and friends in the new society. Higher education could be a risk factor for these conflicts. Future studies are needed to distinguish everyday life conflict from acculturation-related conflict in this population.
4:::The development of a relapse affects the subsequent management and outcome of clubfoot deformity. The importance of bracing should be reinforced to parents. Bracing until at least age 4 years may be beneficial. For patients whose families are especially resistant to brace use and for older patients who experience a second relapse, regaining correction of the deformity via cast treatment followed by an Achilles lengthening procedure and/or tendon transfer may be the best alternative.
4:::Receipt of industry payments was associated with a decreased rate of generic drug prescribing. How this affects patient care and total medical costs warrants further study. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
4:::This survey highlights the gaps in transposing evidence-based or consensus guidelines in the real-world management of T/PLD administration; these findings could be useful in order to focus the attention on specific knowledge and/or experience gaps and plan pertinent educational programs.
4:::Neoadjuvant TC dose-dense in cervical carcinoma has a high response rate, comparable with TIP, and an acceptable toxicity.
4:::We presented the first fluid characterization of ascites in patients with cardiac cirrhosis. AFP was significantly lower than that from non-cirrhotic cardiac ascites, likely secondary to decreased serum protein level. AFP equal to or less than 4.3g/dl could be utilized to screen for concurrent cardiac cirrhosis with high sensitivity in patients with cardiogenic ascites without other predisposing factors for liver injury.
4:::Inclusion of quantitative information increases consistency of PET scan interpretations for early detection of cerebral amyloid-β plaque accumulation.
4:::Low serum BDNF levels are associated with characteristics related to alcohol consumption and mood disorders, and variants of the BDNF gene in alcohol use disorder patients. The factors that most strongly influenced changes in serum BDNF levels following treatment in an alcohol detoxification program were variants of the BDNF gene and ongoing depression.
4:::Electronic tracking of GWG is an effective component of electronic and mobile health interventions aiming to decrease the prevalence of excessive GWG in not-low-income women. Income group-specific motivators are needed to increase the prevalence of GWG tracking.
4:::Social support and strain were associated with cognitive outcomes. Future longitudinal studies should be conducted.
4:::The current work demonstrates a novel method of producing (212)Pb-based radioimmunoconjugates from a (224)Ra-solution, which may be simpler and less time-consuming for the end user compared with the method established for use in clinical trials of (212)Pb-TCMC-trastuzumab.
4:::Simulations predicted lower steady-state peak/trough olaparib exposure through 24-36 h post carboplatin pre-treatment, but this effect was lost by day 2 and thus no dose adjustment is recommended.
4:::We found a positive association between birth size and BMC in adolescence. However, this association was attenuated after adjustment for weight, height and physical activity during adolescence.
4:::our study proved that AcAE possess an important antihypertensive, hypotensive and vasorelaxant effect, which is mediated via calmodulin-NO-cGC-PKG pathway, and via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-operated calcium channels and activation of intracellular calcium mobilization into sarcoplasmic reticulum. Therefore, our findings give first evidence about the traditional use of A. campestris L. as antihypertensive plant.
4:::Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT was very well tolerated. We consider Ga-PSMA-11 to be safe for human application.
4:::Up to 10% of children admitted following trauma are victims of assault with traumatic brain injuries predominant in infants and firearm injuries predominant in adolescents. Injury patterns largely correlate to age and race. Assault in children is associated with a high mortality risk. These data highlight the magnitude of the problem and calls for further involvement of trauma surgeons to improve outcomes, bring awareness and promote preventative strategies to eliminate assault in children.
4:::The results provide evidence that IV alcohol suppresses ghrelin levels similarly to oral alcohol. This study is the first to show that ghrelin predicts subjective effects of alcohol, suggesting that ghrelin may have a role in the rewarding mechanisms for alcohol.
4:::The proposed method allows creating 3D axonal projection maps overlaid with brain area annotations based on the histological staining results of the same animal.
4:::Our data indicate that both isoforms of TFPI are present in advanced plaques and that anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages may be a potential source of TFPI.
4:::Surgical resection is associated with significantly longer survival for early SCLC. New randomized trials should assess trimodality therapy in stages I/II, and in node negative disease.
4:::Due to the crucial role of future-oriented beliefs in guiding decision-making and goal-directed behavior, this optimistic update bias for positive events may cognitively underpin the mania-typical engagement in highly pleasurable activities despite warnings for harmful consequences.
4:::Preoperative serum C-reactive protein level is an independent and significant indicator for elevated morbidity and mortality after pulmonary resection. We propose the evaluation of CRP levels as a preoperative diagnostic modality of risk assessment in addition to standardised functional testing.
4:::Invasive mediastinal staging should be strongly encouraged in central tumors and solid T2 tumors because the risk of occult nodal involvement is greater than 10% in these cohorts. However, for patients with peripheral T1 tumors or peripheral T2 tumors with a significant ground glass component, the yield of invasive staging after a negative PET-CT is very low and invasive staging may not be warranted.
4:::The results indicate that counseling may reduce symptom prevalence in women with vulvar neoplasia by a clinically relevant extent. The observed group differences between the 2 interventions slightly favor counseling over written information. The results justify testing the benefit of counseling thoroughly in a comparative phase III trial.
4:::The approach was fast and safe with excellent visualization. It allows surgeons to address other injuries in the same setting. It can be considered as a minimally-invasive open surgery without surgery-related morbidity. It is a reproducible technique that can be done at any trauma centre by surgeons with average experience. The subjective and objective results of the technique are excellent and comparable to the arthroscopic procedures that needs more specific centres with well-trained surgeons.
4:::Concomitant CM procedures performed with cryothermal energy alone or combined with bipolar radiofrequency ablation are safe and exceedingly effective. The association of cryothermal energy alone with higher rates of sinus rhythm and stroke reduction should be investigated further.
4:::This review highlights the importance of assessing the mechanical properties of dentin alongside to the newly formed apatite content in order to prove BAGs efficiency to remineralize this tissue. Though studies have confirmed that BAGs stimulate excellent apatite formation in dentin, it should be concluded that there isnt sufficient evidence for bioactive glass to effectively remineralize this tissue as the mechanical properties of the BAG treated dentin haven't been well explored.'
4:::The use of stents for the management of benign esophageal perforation has increased by over fourfold in just 8 years, but short-term outcomes have not changed over time for this population of patients. A national registry for off-label use of esophageal stents may clarify the indications for and risks and benefits of stenting benign esophageal perforations.

4:::There was no significant difference in survival outcome between stage IV MBC and FBC, but significant differences in clinicopathological features and patterns of metastases between the genders.
4:::Drainage of the abdominal cavity had no impact on postoperative abscess and reoperation rates. Standardization of drainage in this context is required.
4:::Collecting PRO data from lung cancer surgical patients and integrating the results into an institutional database is feasible. This pilot serves as a model for widespread incorporation of PRO data into the STS Database. Future integration of such data will continue to position the STS National Database as the gold standard for clinical registries. This will be necessary for assessing overall patient responses to different surgical therapies.
4:::This study is significant in the following three domains: 1) it contributed to student feedback because it examined the issue from a students perspective; 2) it explored the timing and channels for collecting feedback from the students' point of view; and 3) it showed the preferred uses of student feedback.'
4:::Irrespective of the type of irrigant, an increase in the apical preparation size significantly enhanced root canal disinfection. The disinfecting benefit of NaOCl over saline was significant at large apical preparation sizes.
4:::E-health interventions are a very successful way to increase PA. More research is required to look at what theoretical principles are best to underpin interventions and also to assess the length of intervention required for optimal results after intervention. Ideas surrounding implementation and the mediums used require more studies to evidence base these interventions for schools, colleges and university via intracurriculum or extracurriculum.
4:::Patients with preserved integrity of the CST showed better motor function than patients with discontinued integrity of the CST. In both groups, significant motor recovery was achieved during the first four months after onset. In addition, the most rapid motor recovery occurred during the first month and then decreased gradually with the passage of time.
4:::The low levels of selenium and rubidium in blood and plasma from CRRT patients, together with the loss via CRRT effluent, raises the possibility of the need for selenium supplementation in this group of patients, despite the unchanged levels during the short study period. Further investigations on the effect of additional administration of trace elements to CRRT patients would be of interest.
4:::A significant number of nerve fibers were present in the anterior and anterolateral positions, especially at the apex. The anterior nerves were closer to the prostate. This proximity suggests that the anterior nerves may participate in local physiology and that the cavernous nerves are probably formed by the posterior nerve fibers. It is likely that the safe distance of 2.5 mm from all surfaces of the prostate may be related to cavernous fiber preservation.
4:::In conclusion, we were unable to show that performance dentistry improved equine rideability assessed by rider scoring. The addition of more objective measurement tools and a longer assessment period may help to scientifically prove what is anecdotally believed.
4:::It poses a challenge but is nevertheless important for municipalities to develop support targeted at parents of adolescents which is tailored to their needs, and to reach out with information.
4:::In this pilot study, measurements can be performed in an appropriate timeline for clinical care with potential to serve as a prognostic marker. Further work is necessary to develop high-resolution respirometry as a clinical tool for assessing the severity of illness and guiding therapy.
4:::Psychological instability, violence and crime were found in all these categories of familicides. Perpetrators who had committed a suicide in addition to the familicide had more often been diagnosed with depression, but they sought treatment for mental health problems less often and had violence and self-destructiveness less often in their background than in other familicide categories. Social and healthcare professionals should be more sensitive to emerging family problems and be prepared for intervention.

4:::FLAPS is a new technique, in which the preparation of an ultrathin CAG is done by the FSL. After optimization in porcine eyes, the clinical trial in the first 6 eyes was performed without any complications and the FSL might assist in further standardizing the surgical procedure. Longer follow-up and larger cohorts are needed to assess recurrence rates.
4:::The effectiveness of an organized secondary prevention programme for stroke may be limited in patients from high-performing hospitals with regular post-discharge follow-up and communication with general practices.
4:::The low contribution of admission criteria to GPA suggests that there is no justification for raising the level of the present criteria.
4:::The progression rate was slower than in other spinocerebellar ataxias. A consistently recurrent intragenic haplotype was found, suggesting a common ancestry for most, if not all, patients.
4:::A higher bicarbonate concentration in the dialysate of animals undergoing hypercapnic respiratory failure was associated with improved blood pH control without increasing the PaCO2 levels.

Determining the grade in both the primary tumor and a metastasis is important for estimating prognosis and to help inform decisions regarding additional therapies.
4:::This study thus demonstrates the relaxant effect of αCGRP on rat MCA. The vasorelaxation is associated with a simultaneous decrease in intracellular calcium levels. Telcagepant reduced relaxation and thwarted the reduction in intracellular calcium levels localized in the vascular smooth muscle cells. In addition, telcagepant may act as a non-competitive antagonist at concentrations greater than 10(-8) M.
4:::This study outlined a relevant presence of symptoms of central sensitization among children with migraine. Severe allodynia and comorbidity for JFM seemed to cause a general decline of quality of life, which would suggest the opportunity of a routine assessment of these clinical features.
4:::All non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and warfarin were classified as beneficial or very beneficial in older persons (FORTA-A or -B), underlining the overall positive assessment of the risk/benefit ratio for these drugs. For other vitamin-K antagonists regionally used in Europe, the lack of evidence should challenge current practice.
4:::This work illustrates that e-beam lithography is a viable method to create spatial resolution test patterns in a thin film of high molecular weight polymer to allow unbiased judgment of intra-laboratory advancement and/or inter-laboratory comparison of instrument advances in nano-thermal analysis/atomic force microscopy/mass spectrometry chemical imaging. Published in 2017. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.
4:::We established efficient rat colonic stem cell cultures in vitro. This success will contribute to the study of rat intestinal-disease models.

4:::Lacosamide and zonisamide are viable options for the treatment of epilepsy in the elderly and have similar retention rates.
4:::The majority of patients with active MC responded to thiopurines, methotrexate, or anti-TNF therapy. Larger controlled studies are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of these medications in MC.
4:::The LC/LTQ-Orbitrap method offers adequate performance in comparison with previously validated method on a LC/MS/MS system resulting in acceptance of the transfer of the method from LC/MS/MS to LC/LTQ-Orbitrap. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
4:::LOR is still a big concern with anti-TNFa therapies. Stand-alone anti-TNFa trough and antibody levels are not useful at predicting LOR/disease progression at 1 year, but low trough levels do correlate well with elevated CRP, hypoalbuminaemia, and poor response rates.
4:::The geographic variation in HCC highlights the need for neighborhood-targeted interventions to address risk factors and barriers to care. The clusters of HCC by viral hepatitis status may serve as a basis for healthcare policymakers and practitioners to prioritize neighborhoods for cancer screening and control efforts.
4:::After a failed filtration surgery, a low-diffuse bleb was reestablished by pretreating with subconjunctival mitomycin C followed by ab interno bleb revision with the Grover-Fellman biplanar sclerostomy spatula, decreasing further more invasive glaucoma procedures.
4:::Scutellaria barbata D. Don could inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in A2780 cells through mitochondrial pathway. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of Scutellaria barbata D. Don on the migration of ovarian cancer cells was associated with the down-regulation of MMP-2/9 expression. These findings could shed a light on the therapy of ovarian cancer.
4:::Both transepithelial and accelerated epithelium-off CXL produced biomechanical and histopathologic improvements, which were not significantly different between the 2 pulsed-light accelerated CXL treatments.
4:::Although increased cultural awareness and a growing cultural competence was identified by the students undertaking international clinical placement, further research is required. It is important to investigate the best methods to support the students reflection such that the experiences lead to learning.'
4:::SEPs accurately predict clinical outcomes in newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and improve the EEG-based prediction particularly in those newborns with severely or moderately abnormal EEG findings.
4:::Results (a) show the importance of executive dysfunction in the context of other impaired cognitive domains when predicting functional decline in at-risk elders, and (b) support our previous work demonstrating that ADNIs MCI criteria may have resulted in false-positive MCI diagnoses, given the CDN's better FAQ trajectory than those of the cognitively impaired MCI groups. (JINS, 2017, 23, 521-527).'
4:::Individuals with effort-reward imbalance at work have an increased risk of coronary heart disease, and this appears to be independent of job strain experienced. These findings support expanding focus beyond just job strain in future research on work stress.
4:::Despite the recent introduction of sequencing-based methods, the HRM method deserves consideration in research fields of infectious diseases, being characterized by low cost, rapidity, flexibility and versatility. However, there are some limitations to HRM assays development, which should be carefully considered. The most common application of HRM for bacterial typing is related to Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)-based genotyping with the analysis of gene fragments within the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) loci, following an approach termed mini-MLST or Minim typing. Although the resolving power is not totally correspondent to MLST, the Simpsons Index of Diversity provided by HRM method typically >0.95. Furthermore, the cost of this approach is less than MLST, enabling low cost surveillance and rapid response for outbreak control. Hence, the potential of HRM technology can strongly facilitate routine research and diagnostics in the epidemiological studies, as well as advance and streamline the genetic characterization of bacterial pathogens.'
4:::These preliminary analyses suggest that subjective sleep disturbance (low efficiency, short sleep) is common in FND. Sleep quality was negatively associated with the functional impairment attributed to FND, independent of depression. Therefore, sleep disturbance may be a clinically important feature of FND.
4:::There was 95% agreement between the HGI and G-gap using GA among type 2 diabetes patients. Furthermore, a high HGI was associated with a higher prevalence of insulin use among type 2 diabetes patients.
4:::This study will provide a tool for the assessment of the complexity of care, with the goal of improving the quality of care for the patients and of interacting with the health administration system for the management of resources.
4:::Compared to clopidogrel and prasugrel, ticagrelor reduced neointimal formation, endothelial dysfunction, and peri-strut inflammation.
4:::The coverage achieved among the Tarantos ASL GPs during the 2015/16 season reaches the minimum threshold set by the Minister, but they could implement their knowledge and their participation in relation to the anti-influenza vaccine in order to discard all the wrong or clearly unfounded common beliefs. The best strategy in order to optimize the governance system seems to be the empowerment of primary care physicians, to be fulfilled through actions shared with the Public Healthcare Services based on training, communication and projects supporting vaccine coverage.'
4:::Culture is created locally by individual influencers. Cluster analysis is an effective way to identify common characteristics among members of an intensive care unit team that are noted as highly influential by their peers. To change culture, identifying and then integrating the influencers in intervention development and dissemination may create more sustainable and effective culture change. Additional studies are ongoing to test the effectiveness of utilising these influencers to disseminate patient safety interventions.
4:::It is not just the biomedical facts' of health conditions that are relevant, but rather the meaning attributed to these facts and how they are weighed in relation to other significant non-medical factors. By moving beyond the medical model of disability to recognize the importance of social and personal factors, and engaging in patient-centered communication, healthcare providers can facilitate pregnancy decision-making that is consistent with the values and preferences of women with disabilities and improve quality of care and support. In order to make motherhood a more viable option for women with disabilities, societal attitudes and a lack of role models for these women also need to be addressed.'
4:::The allele frequencies in the population studied are in accordance with the literature data. The study did not find an association between the analyzed SNPs and susceptibility to bacterial meningitis. The role of SNPs in genes coding toll-like receptors and the interactions between them in controlling inflammation in the central nervous system needs further evaluation.
4:::Metabolomic profiling revealed alterations of intermediate metabolism independently associated with the severity of hypercortisolism, consistent with disturbed protein synthesis/catabolism and incomplete β-oxidation, providing evidence for the occurrence of metabolic inflexibility in hypercortisolism.
4:::Suggestive evidence supports the contention that breastfeeding reduces the risk of type 1 diabetes. Among those who were breastfed, however, no evidence indicated that prolonging full or any breastfeeding was associated with a reduced risk of type 1 diabetes.
4:::This sign is highly specific for the diagnosis of peripherally induced hyperkinetic facial disorders. Its assessment should integrate the routine examination of patients with abnormal facial movements.
4:::Oncologic foot defects can be reliably reconstructed using well-contoured free perforator flaps with minimal functional morbidity.
4:::Preconditioning by opening of BKCa-channels with NS1619 improves cardiac performance after four weeks of reperfusion and reduces myocardial infarction scar.
4:::We demonstrated that the carfilzomib concentration gradient determines cellular uptake kinetics. The uptake kinetics in turn affects binding, saturation, and activity of the proteasome. Together, these data underscore the importance of steep concentrations for the in vitro efficacy of carfilzomib.
4:::Exposure to particulate air pollution during pregnancy is associated with increased levels of cord plasma insulin at birth. The public health relevance of this association is demonstrated by the fact that a 2.4μg/m(3) (SD) increase in PM2.5 during pregnancy on cord plasma insulin levels corresponds to the effect-size of a 9kg/m(2) higher early-pregnancy BMI on cord plasma. Particulate air pollution induced changes in cord plasma insulin levels during early life and might be a risk factor in the development of metabolic disease, such as glucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes, later in life.
4:::This study indicates that gut manipulations lead to increased alcohol intake, whereas RYGB promotes behaviors that may maintain alcohol misuse. Reductions in hedonic feeding and diminished GHSR control of VTA firing further distinguish gut manipulation from complete bypass and present a potential mechanism linking reduced appetite with alcohol misuse after RYGB surgery.
4:::The VRF pathway can be accurately detected in a nonfilled tooth using limited field of view CBCT imaging. The presence of gutta-percha generated a low beam hardening artifact that did not hinder the VRF extent. The presence of an intracanal gold post made the fracture line appear smaller than it really was in the sagittal images; in the axial images, a VRF was only detected when the apical third was involved. The presence of a metal crown did not generate additional artifacts on the root surface compared to the intracanal gold post by itself.
4:::The use of 3D printing technology enabled us to quickly and affordably create unique, complex designs, avoiding the constraints levied by traditional production methods, thereby boosting experimental success and improving the wellbeing of the animals.
4:::In a metropolitan hub-and-spoke network, PSC-door-to-comprehensive stroke center-door and DIDO times are long even in high-volume PSCs. Improving PSC workflow represents a major opportunity to expedite mechanical thrombectomy and improve patient outcomes.
4:::CBCT analysis allowed a more precise evaluation of periapical lesions and healing of endodontic microsurgery than periapical films. Significant differences existed between the 2 methods. Over the observation period, the mean periapical lesion sizes significantly decreased in volume. Given the correct indications, the use of CBCT imaging may be a valuable tool for the evaluation of healing of endodontic surgery.
4:::Our data suggest that the expression of MMP-14, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4 is associated with the development of periapical lesions.
4:::Endoscopic dilation is consistently effective in children and adults with EoE, resulting in improvement in 95% of patients with very low rates (<1%) of major complications.
4:::The software presented here will be valuable tool for researchers in neuroscience working with immunogold cytochemistry.
4:::CVDs remain a major cause of health loss for all regions of the world. Sociodemographic change over the past 25 years has been associated with dramatic declines in CVD in regions with very high SDI, but only a gradual decrease or no change in most regions. Future updates of the GBD study can be used to guide policymakers who are focused on reducing the overall burden of noncommunicable disease and achieving specific global health targets for CVD.
4:::Although this case series found oral ketamine to be safe and well tolerated, the findings also showed rather modest effectiveness of oral ketamine in treatment-resistant depression, with only approximately 30% reporting some benefit and approximately 70% reporting no change or worsening of mood. However, bearing in mind the limitations of this small, open-label case series, further exploration of the effectiveness of oral ketamine is warranted.
4:::Women are willing to report their participation in a range of sexual practices. Of those who participated in anal practices, 11% did not have anal intercourse. Adding additional sexual health questions to clinical intake forms may enable clinicians to better counsel their patients on risky sexual behaviors.
4:::Iliocaval stent reconstruction is an effective treatment for filter-associated thrombosis with 100% technical success and 96% clinical success at 6 months. Technical and clinical outcomes in patients who underwent filter retrieval versus filter exclusion were similar.
4:::The CDR and FP rate of surveillance MRI in this study were comparable to those reported for women with BRCA mutations. The addition of annual MRI to mammography should be considered for surveillance of women with a combination of these risk factors, particularly if they have a family history of BC and are not on anti-estrogen therapy.
4:::Several types of psychopathology, as well as a family history of alcohol problems, increased the likelihood of drinking despite health problems among individuals with liver disease. These findings highlight the need to intervene with heavily drinking individuals with liver disease, who may be drinking due to familial risk and/or comorbid psychopathology.
4:::The majority of anti-NMDAR encephalitis patients had abnormal EEG. EEG could sensitively reflect the abnormal brain functions of patients and could assist with early clinical diagnosis and prognosis prediction.
4:::Clinical findings highlighted the inverse association between lutein and IL-6 in CAD patients. Anti-inflammatory effects of lutein in PBMCs from CAD patients were consolidated in ex vivo experiments. Taken together, these results show that lutein has the potential to play a role in resolution of chronic inflammation in CAD patients.
4:::Biomarker screening by low SPGI among middle-aged men followed by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy decreased long-term and premature mortality due to gastric cancer. However, in spite of methodological corrections done, the results do not justify any firm conclusions or recommend general screening programs. Randomized trials are warranted for this purpose.
4:::When diagnosed at early stages, melanoma does not seem to alter the evolution of gestation, whereas patients with advanced stages of melanoma frequently deliver prematurely, by caesarean section, with lower neonatal weight, higher neonatal morbidity and mortality rates.
4:::The toxicity of robotic SBRT in a large clinical cohort of PCa patients was tolerable and the early PSA response was good in all risk groups. The hypofractionated SBRT offers a possibility to high dose per fraction and to provide the whole radiotherapy treatment within two to three weeks.
4:::Information from case reports indicates that CSII is safe and effective for the management of NDM.
4:::This oscillometric device met the 2007 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine guidelines for measurement of BP on the thoracic limb. There was good agreement between the oscillometer and invasive measurement of MAP at all locations.
4:::The collagen biomarkers PIIINP and ICTP, in part through pathophysiologically parallel associations with renal function, predicted ChrIRD and total death. Moreover, PIIINP predicted future cancer. These collagen markers may help differentiate healthy from unhealthy aging.
4:::Parental stress in parents of children with CDH seems to increase with the severity of the childs malformation. Mothers tend to score higher parental stress than fathers.'
4:::Children with adequately compensated chronic hypoxemia appear to have ScO2 values within the normal range. The ΔSaO2-ScO2 is inversely related to Hb, with the implication that in the presence of reduced Hb, particularly if coupled with a decreased cardiac output, the ScO2 can fall to values associated with brain injury in laboratory studies.
4:::It is proposed that the adoption of a proactive and more personalized approach in the clinic such as a treat-and-extend regimen will lead to benefits for both the patient and the physician, through a reduction in the associated treatment burden and better utilization of clinic resources. Implementation of the four principles should also lead to better VA outcomes for each patient, with a minimized risk of vision loss.
4:::Everolimus can effectively reduce tumor size, decrease cerebrospinal fluid protein, and allow successful ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement without the need for surgical resection of a symptomatic SEGA.
4:::The findings highlight the salient nature of social outcomes in the context of varying levels of RS. These findings may have implications for the design of interventions to improve social outcomes following TBI. (JINS, 2017, 23, 451-459).
4:::This study shows that, in normotensives, a single fixed submaximal mouth opening for 10 min is followed by prolonged albeit small reductions of blood pressure and heart rate.
4:::This work shows that SSS is important because it (a) has an independent association with BMI net of SES, which suggests that it captures unique aspects of social and economic conditions missed by objective indicators of SES and (b) may help link SES with BMI through perceptions of ones place in the status hierarchy of society. (PsycINFO Database Record'
4:::Longevity of posterior composite multisurface restoration is comparable to amalgam longevity.
4:::Medical nutrition therapy was associated with reduction of the fetal weight in women with GDM and the weight decreases with length of treatment. Birth weight above 4 kg was as prominent in the non-diabetic women as in the women with GDM without MNT.
4:::The M/P ratio was disproportionately reduced in PSP, suggesting its potential as a clinical marker of the PSP syndrome. Larger studies of pathologically confirmed cases are needed to establish the M/P ratio as a biomarker of PSP pathology.
4:::We demonstrate the capabilities of various NLP models and the use of two text inclusion strategies at categorizing medication related patient safety events. The NLP models and visualization could be used to improve the efficiency of patient safety event data review and analysis.
4:::Lymph node ratio may be an useful parameter to stratify risk of locoregional recurrence of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. Thus lymph node ratio might help to improve diagnosis and therapy of affected patients.
4:::Our study findings underscore the diagnostic superiority of enrichment culture and/or PCR over conventional microbiological culture for improved case detection of melioidosis from non-blood clinical specimens.
4:::The 2011 Occupy school movement in Chile had no detectable causal effect on substance use among Chilean adolescents. The increase in marijuana use from 2009 to 2013 seems to be part of broader social changes occurring among the school-age population.
4:::The nicotine content of these e-liquids matched the labels on the bottles, and was relatively constant across production batches. The content of propylene glycol and glycerol was also stable across batches, as was the pH.
4:::Our findings suggest that early life stress caused co-occurrence of anxiety and depression-like behavior at PND32 (mimics human early-adolescent period). This co-occurrence was lost at PND60 with demonstration of anxiety- but not depression-like behavior. Later, depression but not anxiety-like behavior was observed at PND90. It seems that behavioral adaptations occur at the critical PND60 stage (mimics human late-adolescent period), where behavioral and cognitive switching occurs, thereby, expressing susceptible and resilient phenotypes.
4:::These preliminary findings, though in need of replication, support the characterization of problem gambling with ASPD as a subtype of problem gambling associated with higher rates of impulsivity and executive function deficits. Taken together, these results may have treatment implications.
4:::Visuo-tactile temporal discrimination separates controls from patients with IAOCD and its 1st degree relatives. 36% of the latter had abnormal visuo-tactile thresholds supporting the role of visuo-tactile temporal discrimination as an endophenotype for IAOCD.
4:::Multilevel interventions designed to increase male client volume and sexually transmitted infection testing services in family planning clinics succeeded without affecting female client volume or services.
4:::The MUNIX technique shows an inherent variation attributable to SIP epochs at low contraction levels. It is recommended that more epochs should be sampled at these low contraction levels to improve the repeatability.
4:::We found no association between prenatal exposure to RFR and child neurodevelopment during the first three years of life; however, a potential combined effect of prenatal exposure to lead and mobile phone use was suggested.
4:::The Elder Abuse Nurse Examiner Curriculum and associated training materials were efficacious in improving SANEs self-reported knowledge of and perceived competence in delivering elder abuse care. Future steps will further evaluate these materials as a component of a pilot of a larger comprehensive Elder Abuse Intervention at multiple sites across Ontario.'
4:::Insulin and Gla have greater impacts on central nervous system than insulin analogs with high albumin sensitivity, such as Det and Deg. These pharmacological profiles should be taken into account for developing an insulin-based therapy to treat Alzheimers disease.'
4:::Nursing students had a positive perception of their clinical learning experience, although there remains room for improvement. Enabling a greater understanding of students perspective on the quality of clinical education is important for nursing education and future research.'
4:::A majority of patients with DED report some degree of ocular pain, which correlates only moderately with the OSDI score. Severity of ocular pain correlates with nonocular comorbidities such as use of antidepressant medications rather than with clinical signs of DED.
4:::Total laryngectomy determines olfactory and gustatory impairments that should be taken into account in clinical practice. Relationships between sensorial alterations, aging, follow-up period, and adjuvant treatments should be further evaluated in prospective studies.
4:::The current study showed that participation, attendance, acceptability, adherence, drop-out, and effectiveness of the SLIMMER intervention were in general not modified by socioeconomic status. The SLIMMER intervention can contribute to health promotion for individuals in both low and higher socioeconomic groups.
4:::IV Levetiracetam controls status epilepticus or cluster seizures with an efficacy comparable to that of phenytoin. Use of these two agents consecutively may control >90% of all such conditions without resort to anaesthetic agents. Further studies should explore its efficacy in larger cohorts of epileptic emergencies.
4:::This is the first study to show that observed positive parenting is associated with lower levels of inflammation in adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record
4:::Both algorithms provided very high and comparable safety as quantified by the NPV and sensitivity for AMI and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30 days in patients triaged toward rule-out, although sensitivity for MACE at 30 days was lower with both algorithms in cohort 2. Although the 2-h algorithm was more efficacious, not all patients ruled out for AMI by this algorithm were appropriate candidates for early discharge. The 2h-ADP seems superior in the selection of patients for early discharge from the ED.
4:::Migraine is not associated with excess atherosclerosis in large vessels in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Our findings suggest that the biological mechanisms by which migraine results in ischemic stroke are not related to macrovascular cerebral atherosclerosis.
4:::Assessment with the BROWSE model helped to identify cropping systems with decreased risks from pesticides for human health and to propose some improvements to the cropping systems by identifying the pesticides that led to unacceptable risks.
4:::Subjects with diabetes and pre-diabetes experience more cold-related cardiorespiratory symptoms and need instructions for proper protection from cold weather to reduce adverse health effects.
4:::Compounds from P. trinervia showed antigiardial activity; to enhance this activity, piquerol and trinervinol can be chemically modified.
4:::Middle-age adult Asians with the ADRB3 rs4994 minor alleles are at increased risk of T2DM.
4:::When injectable hydromorphone and diacetylmorphine are individually dosed and monitored, their opioid-related side effects, including potential fatal overdoses, are safely mitigated and treated by health care providers. In the midst of an opioid overdose epidemic, injectable options are timely to reach a very important minority of people who inject street opioids and are not attracted to other treatments.
4:::In healthy subjects, the sublingual microcirculatory physiological reserve can be assessed non-invasively by topical application of nitroglycerin without affecting systemic circulation.
4:::HCVcAg demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for detection of pre-treatment and post-treatment viraemia. This study indicates that confirmation of active HCV infection, including recurrent viraemia, by HCVcAg is possible. Reduced on-treatment sensitivity of HCVcAg may be a clinical advantage given the moves toward simplification of monitoring schedules.
4:::Frequent clustering of HIV-positive MSM shows that HCV infection has spread through a local network in Barcelona. This outbreak is related to a large international HCV transmission network among MSM. Public health efforts are needed to reduce HCV transmission among this high-risk group.
4:::The effects of TRT on cardiovascular risk markers were ambiguous. We observed potentially harmful changes in cardiovascular risk parameters, markedly reduced subcutaneous fat and unchanged ectopic fat during TRT and a reduction in adiponectin levels. On the other hand, the decrease in leptin and leptin:adiponectin ratio assessments could reflect an amelioration of the cardiovascular risk profile linked to hyperleptinaemia in ageing men with T2D.
4:::Cognitive avoidance in smokers during aversive stimulation might result in sustaining addictive behaviors. On the other hand, non-smokers may be able to emotionally confront the adverse effects of smoking.
4:::The correlative whole-body FCH PET/CT and pelvic DCE-MRI offer a complementary and comprehensive diagnostic workup for better management of PC patients with BCR following RP.
4:::Results show clear evidence that the exposure to the game-like simulation had a significant positive effect on all the constructs. After their first visit to the theatre, students in EG showed less fear (C1) and also perceived to have committed fewer errors (C3), while they showed higher perceived knowledge (C2) and a more collaborative attitude (C4).
4:::This suggests that, aside from oscillatory alpha power, additional neuronal mechanisms influence the excitability of early visual cortex. One of these may involve a more internally oriented mode of brain operation, engaged by closing the eyes. In this state, visual cortex may be more susceptible to top-down inputs, to facilitate for example multisensory integration or imagery/working memory, although alternative explanations remain possible.
4:::Arsenic in drinking water was positively associated with VLBW and PTB in a population where nearly all (>99%) of the population was exposed under the current maximum contaminant level of 10µg/L. Current regulatory standards may not be protective against reproductive effects of prenatal exposure to arsenic.
4:::Precise species and subspecies identification and the determination of macrolide susceptibility are recommended for the optimal treatment of extrapulmonary MABC infections.
4:::Based on a single study, sparse LDA showed the highest diagnostic accuracy. RCF is present in a considerable percentage of axonal patients.
4:::This was the first study to document the loss of nutrients from wasted food in the US food supply, to our knowledge. Although only a portion of discarded food can realistically be made available for human consumption, efforts to redistribute surplus foods where appropriate and prevent food waste in the first place could increase the availability of nutrients for Americans, while saving money and natural resources.
4:::Our patients with multilobar drug-resistant epilepsy showed evidence of multifocal epileptogenicity that specifically skipped the MA.
4:::The highest amplitude of dorsal sural SNAPs was constantly obtained by SSEs since SNAPs arising from whole digital branches of the DSN could be elicited by placement of SSEs.
4:::Myofibromas may resemble several other entities. Because of the potential for multiple (perhaps visceral) lesions and the possibility of overtreatment, accurate diagnosis is of utmost importance. Reports of cases with minimally invasive treatment are sparse, and no standardized treatment protocol has been established. This information should be a priority for future publications.
4:::HFX is associated with improved survival compared with CFX among patients treated with definitive radiotherapy for ESGC, particularly among patients with cT2 disease. HFX utilization increased over the study period; however, 40% of patients in our cohort did not receive HFX in the most recent year of our analysis.
4:::The tPA-TEG identifies trauma patients who require massive transfusion efficiently in a single assay that can be completed in a shorter time than other scoring systems, which has improved performance when combined with international normalized ratio. This new method is consistent with our understanding of the molecular events responsible for trauma-induced coagulopathy.
4:::We showed that harmonization increased the agreement of results from the participating immunoassays, and may allow them to adopt a more uniform RI in the future.
4:::Within the limitations of this study, hydroxy apatite enhanced osteogenesis ability of porous zirconia scaffolds.
4:::MIRT or MIRT+ALA reverse CORT-induced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors probably via their central antioxidant effects. Augmentation of MIRT with ALA may reverse sedation, an important side effect of MIRT. Randomized controlled studies are needed to examine the clinical efficacy of this combination in human depression.
4:::Denser aPVAT is associated with aPVAT volume and AC in SLE women. Adjusting for aPVAT volume attenuated the detected association between aPVAT density and AC, which may be indicative of adipose dysfunction.
4:::Markers of physical function-walking speed and grip strength-were consistently associated with survival and recovery after ischemic stroke. Inflammation, kidney function, and frailty also seemed to be determinants of survival and recovery after an ischemic stroke. These markers of vulnerability may identify targets for differing pre and poststroke medical management and rehabilitation among older adults at risk of poor stroke outcomes.
4:::A simple self-reported questionnaire can be used to identify those at high risk for stroke better than the gold standard FSRF. This instrument can be used clinically to easily identify individuals at high risk for stroke and also scientifically to identify a subpopulation enriched for stroke risk.
4:::This is the largest survey of clinical features in children with PTEN pathogenic mutations to date. It confirms earlier reports of increased rates of neurodevelopmental disorders. Dermatological, GI and thyroid abnormalities are age dependent and may not be present at the time of diagnosis, requiring regular monitoring and medical surveillance. Early paediatric diagnosis is important for institution of medical and developmental surveillance as well as for testing other at- risk family members.
4:::In patients with ≤5 cm hemangioma, surgical resection can be indicated when a malignant tumor cannot be ruled out. However, surgery for 5-10 cm asymptomatic hemangiomas should be limited. Experienced hepatic surgeons should conduct hepatectomy for tumors >15 cm to avoid serious morbidity or mortality.
4:::In-hospital events as well as short- and long-term mortality rates among TTS patients diagnosed with a significantly reduced LVEF on admission were significantly higher. There is an urgent need for randomized trials, which could help define uniform clinical management strategies for high risk TTS patients.
4:::Serum phosphate is inversely associated with measures of adiposity in both women and men, largely independently of PTH. FGF23 might mediate these associations. This relationship may be an unrecognized confounder in some of the correlates of serum phosphate already described.
4:::The contributions of this study are: (a) a set of thorough experiments that enable comparisons regarding the influence of different types of features on different classifiers, exploring two languages other than English; and (b) the use of ensembles of clusters of Brown trees and semantic spaces on EHRs to tackle the problem of scarcity of available annotated data.
4:::WIC-participating retailers must adhere to very different minimum stocking requirements across states, which may result in disparities in food and beverage products available to WIC recipients. Public Health Implications. The results provide benchmarks that can inform new local, state, and federal program and policy efforts to increase healthy food availability in retail settings.
4:::The shade selection program that was developed is a viable system that could reduce variability in observer selections while increasing patient satisfaction for potential use in clinical situations that require color matching a restoration to a tooth.
4:::Although we observed significant bivariate relationships between race/ethnicity dyads and use of force, these relationships largely dissipated after we controlled for other factors.
4:::This study highlights the importance of studying not only the influence of smoking but also of snuffing on the progression, severity and treatment outcome in individuals with alcohol dependence.
4:::This 11-fold rise in claims for breast pumps by women with private insurance suggests that these women will likely increase breastfeeding initiation or duration; however, without additional support for women with Medicaid, disparities in breastfeeding may increase.
4:::A spike in ZIKV cases occurred after the earthquake. Patients in the area closest to the epicenter had a delay in seeking care.
4:::A higher level of play may result in higher match injury incidence. Muscle and tendon injuries were the most common type of soft tissue injury, while the lower limb was the most common location of injury in rugby union players, and running was responsible for the highest injury incidence during non-contact events.
4:::The study showed that CD133/ALDH1 expression impacts HGSOC patients survival and first suggests that CSCs might undergo phenotypic change during the disease course similarly to non stem-like cancer cells, providing also a first evidence that there is no correlation between CSCs and BRCA status.'
4:::The Walk to Fly study demonstrated a significant and sustained increase in the number of airport travelers choosing to walk. Providing signage about options to walk in busy locations where reasonable walking options are available may improve population levels of physical activity and therefore improve public health.
4:::Though neuropsychiatric profiles were similar for men and women with current or recent alcohol dependence, plasma factors associated with increases in depression, anxiety, and memory impairment differed and support the need to tailor treatments based on sex.
4:::Our study demonstrates how hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic Nod2 regulate intestinal barrier function, improving our knowledge on the mechanisms involved in CD pathogenesis.
4:::Glycemic control seem to influence the severity of depressive symptoms, but the reciprocal association seems non-significant. AT and diabetes type may shape this relationship influencing distress and adherence to medications. Findings may aid interventions aimed at improving patients care and quality of life.'
4:::Greater distance to referral health care center was associated with increased risk for needing IBD-related surgery in patients with Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis.'
4:::These findings corroborate the therapeutic potential of the TM lectin-like domain in AAA. The attenuation of angiotensin II-infused AAA by one-time delivery of rAAV-TMD1 provides a proof-of-concept validation of its application as potential gene therapy for aneurysm development.
4:::This study did not demonstrate the superiority of baclofen in the maintenance of abstinence at the target dose of 180 mg/day. A tendency towards a reduction in alcohol consumption and a significantly decreased craving were observed in favour of baclofen.
4:::Our data confirm that consumption of carbonated soft drinks is frequent among young adolescents in LMICs. Our findings highlight the need for interventions in these countries to reduce adolescents carbonated soft drink consumption.'
4:::Pretreatment with BTX may induce the arteriolar resting diameter to be closer to their maximum potential diameter. Additionally, BTX does not display a synergistic effect with topical vasodilators on vasodilation.
4:::Findings provide no evidence that moral judgment is fundamentally compromised in schizophrenia. Evidence of slower moral judgment in schizophrenia does suggest, however, that patients were less influenced by automatic aversive responses to amoral conduct. The association found between poorer (self-reported) perspective-taking and greater condemnation of social transgressions also suggests that an insensitivity to others extenuating motives may exacerbate social misunderstandings in schizophrenia.'
4:::The proportion of treatment admissions reporting prescription opioid injection and smoking/inhalation abuse increased significantly in the U.S. between 2004 and 2013. Expanding prevention efforts as well as access to medication-assisted treatment and risk reduction services for people who inject drugs is urgently needed.
4:::We report a large prospective series of GEP-NEC which show the predominance of large cell type and advanced stage at diagnosis. Prognosis was found more homogeneous than previously reported, mainly impacted by PS and tumour burden.
4:::After 2 years follow-up, safety was maintained in this large group of patients with BRAF(V600) mutation-positive metastatic melanoma who are more representative of routine clinical practice than typical clinical trial populations. These data suggest that long-term vemurafenib treatment is effective and tolerable without the development of new safety signals.'
4:::Rates of syndemic conditions among this national sample of gay and bisexual men were generally comparable to previous studies, however elevated rates in nonurban men suggest the need for targeted intervention and support. Links observed between syndemics and HIV transmission risk behavior highlight the ongoing need to address psychosocial concerns among gay and bisexual men in order to reduce their disproportionately high rates of HIV infection. (PsycINFO Database Record
4:::This finding reinforced the association between telomere abnormalities and PCOS. Given the importance of telomere length in cellular proliferation, our findings provided novel insights into the pathophysiology of PCOS that abnormalities in telomere length possibly disturb folliculogenesis and subsequently result in PCOS.
4:::Early-onset pancreatitis is associated strongly with PRSS1 or CTRC mutations and family history of pancreatitis. Children with later-onset disease are more likely to have nongenetic risk factors. Future studies are needed to investigate whether the disease course, response to therapy, or clinical outcomes differ relative to the timing of disease onset.
4:::A positive FHAD confers a significantly increased risk of developing aortic dissection on family members, with a higher annual probability of aortic dissection, a shorter duration of ""exposure time"" before dissection occurs and a lower mean age at time of dissection.
4:::CRS and HIPEC is a well-established treatment for peritoneal surface malignancies worldwide. However, the coverage as well as the registration of treatment procedures differs widely. The most striking difference is the proportion of HIPEC procedures per capita which ranges from 1.3 to 57 patients per million. This suggests either a difference in patient selection, lack of access to HIPEC centres or lack of appropriate data collection.
4:::Evidence regarding the incidence of recurrent PM after curative surgery for colorectal cancer is poor. Situations at higher risk of recurrent PM are synchronous PM, synchronous isolated ovarian metastases, perforated primary tumour with serosa invasion and mucinous histological subtype.
4:::CRS and HIPEC appear to be safe and effective in patients with peritoneal metastases from unusual cancer sites of origin, especially from rare ovarian carcinomas, PM from neuroendocrine tumours. The respective roles of CRS and HIPEC remain unclear and should be evaluated.
4:::Our LC-MS/MS analysis uncovered a distinct CE profile in urinary sediment from patients with renal disease, suggesting a possible contribution of CEs in urothelial cells to the development of renal disease.
4:::These findings suggest that parental perspective-taking may have implications for biological processes relevant to childhood asthma. (PsycINFO Database Record
4:::Clinical inappropriateness and system factors that preclude alternative community care must be measured separately. They are two very different justifications for hospital admissions, requiring different solutions. Society has a duty to ensure availability of community alternatives for the management of ambulatory-sensitive conditions and facilitate skilling of staff to manage the terminally ill in non-acute settings. Only then would the evaluation of local variations in clinically inappropriate admissions and inappropriate length of stay be possible to undertake.
4:::Routine TVS at day 27 after ET could facilitate the diagnosis of HP, symptoms onset before or after day 27 are clues to early diagnosis. Prompt surgery after diagnosis may improve the prognosis of HP following ET.
4:::We consider that it is important to report not only muscle recovery, but also other aspects of recovery.
4:::We demonstrated beneficial effects of FS and its constituents, suggesting their potential for treatment of intestinal inflammation. These data could provide useful information for managing ulcerative colitis.
4:::Chronic treatment with RV diminishes lipid deposition in atherosclerotic mice, which may be justified, at least in part, by antioxidant systemic and local mechanisms, reinforcing the protective role this resin in the setting of vascular lipid deposition, independent of hypercholesterolemia.
4:::This study suggests the utility of MPA when the Allred score for PgR is ≥3. Future prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.
4:::In this external validation study, the BRA Score tissue expander/implant reconstruction models performed with generally good calibration, discrimination, and accuracy. Some weaknesses in certain models were identified as targets for future improvement. Taken together, these analyses validate the clinical utility of the BRA score risk models in predicting 30-day outcomes.
4:::Metformin treatment is associated with a significant reduction in OM irrespective of diabetes status in patients with EC. The survival benefit suggests that diabetes screening and maintenance of good glycemic control may improve outcomes in EC.
4:::Correction of anterior open bite with either non-extraction or extractions with continuous archwires and vertical anterior elastics uprights the mandibular posterior teeth.
4:::The menopause can be difficult for some women to deal with at work, partly due to the working environment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore womens descriptions of how they would like to be treated by employers/managers, and what would be helpful and unhelpful. The results have clear implications for communication about menopause at work and for employer-level policy and practice.'
4:::Although it should not completely replace RA, SA-based evaluation of Holter ECG reaches a high diagnostic effectiveness for the detection of pAF and can be used for a rapid and resource-saving analysis of ECG data to deal with prolonged monitoring times.
4:::In this cohort of patients newly initiated on antimuscarinic OAB treatment, substantial overlap of patients identified with PIM based on the 2015 Beers Criteria compared with the 2012 Beers Criteria was observed. In addition, the findings suggest that, when applied to antimuscarinic initiators, the 2015 Beers Criteria result in a greater prevalence of PIM and the identification of patients with less overall medical morbidity than the 2012 Beers Criteria.
4:::A vulnerable personality raises risk for hospital-diagnosed peptic ulcer, in part because of an association with health risk behaviors. Its impact is seen in idiopathic' and Helicobacter pylori-associated ulcers, and in acute surgical cases.'
4:::Individuals with GAD exhibited over-engagement of amygdala and frontal regions during the viewing of negative images, compared to HCs. Together, these aberrations may indicate that deficits in emotional reactivity rather than regulation contribute to emotion dysregulation in those with GAD.
4:::The 40-item ISEL may be a useful measure for those studying social support in the context of CG. Given the strikingly low levels of social support, intervention strategies for CG should include components addressing social support.
4:::TLR4 signaling promotes ingestion of sugar and fat by a mechanism involving increased preference for such obesogenic foods.
4:::These findings improve the understanding of the effects of short-term smoking abstinence on insula circuit connectivity and may contribute new insights into the neural basis of abstinence-induced craving to smoke.
4:::The study documented an overall deficit in care with significant regional differences noted compared to practice guidelines. Modifications to treatment modalities and the structure of care may improve outcomes.
4:::Our results suggest that the polymorphisms in CYP3A genes may modify the response to dietary MeHg exposure during early life development.
4:::These findings suggest that EMA is a feasible and reliable method for measuring tobacco message exposure, especially given the prevalence of messages encountered online and on social media. Recall measures are limited in their ability to accurately represent marketing exposure, but might be improved by a period of priming or clearer response categories.
4:::Seizures or epilepsy preceded 1.48% of strokes in patients >60years of age. Based on recent national incidence figures, 5-20% of incident cases of seizures or epilepsy after 60 years of age could herald stroke, depending on age group. These proportions are of a magnitude that merit further study on how to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with late-onset seizures or epilepsy.
4:::Findings of the study indicate that at higher level of distress tolerance, favorable external circumstances, higher internal motivation, and greater readiness to treatment are important indicators of substance abuse treatment retention. The study highlights the need for assessing CMR and distress tolerance levels among substance users entering treatment, and providing targeted interventions to increase substance abuse treatment retention and subsequent recovery from substance abuse among urban African American substance users.
4:::At 6 hours after ICH, excessive autophagy may participate in ER stress-induced brain injury; at 7 days after ICH, autophagy could enhance the protection of ER stress inhibitor possibly via clearing up the cell rubbish generated due to the early-stage damaged autophagic flux.
4:::GWAS-derived polymorphisms estimating body fat distribution are associated with distinct patterns of body fat distribution exactly measured by MR. Only the risk score associated with the waist-to-hip ratio in GWAS showed an unhealthy pattern of metabolism and body fat distribution. This score might be useful for predicting diseases associated with genetically determined, unhealthy obesity.
4:::Normative hand strength values need to be further assessed in a larger study to update normative standards for use in clinical practice.
4:::The paradoxical findings that lower fractional anisotropy was associated both with reading disability and also with better phonological awareness in typical reading development suggest that there are different maturational trajectories of white-matter microstructure in typical readers and children with reading disability, and that this difference is unique to the beginning stages of reading acquisition. The finding that reading disability was associated with radial diffusivity, but that variation in ability among typically developing readers was associated with axial diffusivity, suggests that different neural mechanisms may be associated with reading development in children with or without reading disability. (PsycINFO Database Record
4:::Baseline ASD among recovered BD patients may be a risk marker for hastened depressive recurrence, suggesting it could be an important therapeutic target between mood episodes.
4:::Results from this large multi-ethnic cohort suggest a low prevalence of screen-detected (previously undiagnosed) type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose regulation in adults with ID. However, the high levels of overweight and obesity we found emphasise the need for targeted lifestyle prevention strategies, which are specifically tailored for the needs of people with ID.
4:::The survey shows that many of the recommendations in the European Academy of Neurology/European Association for Palliative Care Taskforce on Neurology Consensus document are understood by neurologists, and several are now seen as part of normal clinical practice. However, there is still a need to develop a more collaborative approach between neurology and palliative care services, for the benefit of patients and families.
4:::Patients with stabbing-related upper extremity wounds had a significant survival advantage over patients without such injuries. However, a greater number of sustained upper extremity wounds may be an external sign of greater severity of thoracic and intraabdominal stabbing injuries.
4:::Although interobserver differences in pathology reporting on biopsy could result in a change of management strategy in approximately 13-20% of men on active surveillance, both pathological revision and tested biomarkers (Ki67 and ERG) did not improve prediction of outcome on radical prostatectomy. Undersampling of most aggressive tumor remains the main focus in order to increase accurate grading at time of treatment decision making.
4:::Echocardiogram use in patients meeting the ""rarely appropriate"" indication criteria is of little diagnostic utility and contributes to additional cost to the patient and health care system.
4:::In patients with BAV aortopathy, unbiased agreement between CTA and TTE imaging can be obtained between the CTA I-I method and TTE SAX mid-diastolic L-L method for the sinuses and the TTE LAX end-diastolic L-L method for the Asc-Ao. When using the CTA O-O method, the best agreement is obtained with the TTE SAX mid-diastolic L-L method for the sinuses (bias ∼2 mm) and the TTE LAX systolic L-L method (bias ∼1 mm) for the Asc-Ao.
4:::Collagen-based scaffolds are suitable for soft tissue engineering in conjunction with the AV loop technique. These scaffolds exhibit distinct patterns of angiogenesis, cell migration, and proliferation and may in the future serve as the basis of tissue-engineered free flaps as an individualized treatment concept for critical wounds.
4:::In this cohort, prenatal urinary DAP concentrations were not associated with childrens social behaviors; these associations were not modified by child PON1 genotype.'
4:::Findings highlight the role of MAT in reducing the disparity in treatment completion between Mexican Americans and non-Latino Whites. Implications for health policy and the dissemination of MAT are discussed.
4:::Aspirin was uncommonly administered as the sole prophylactic agent after hip or knee arthroplasty in this study. However, patients who received aspirin-only had similar rates of post-operative VTE compared to patients who received anticoagulants. Further research should focus on distinguishing which patients benefit more from anticoagulants versus aspirin after arthroplasty.
4:::Health and catastrophic expenditures were substantially lower than in previous studies, although different methods may explain some of the discrepancy. The 20% copayments required by social health insurance would present a financial burden to an additional 0.6% to 5.1% of ART patients. Ensuring access to health insurance for all ART patients will prevent an even higher level of financial hardship.
4:::Varying levels of hearing preservation with conventional length electrodes can be achieved in most pediatric subjects. In the current study, 82% of patients maintained detectable hearing thresholds and 65% maintained functional low-frequency acoustic hearing. These data may be used to guide preoperative counseling in pediatric patients with residual acoustic hearing. Additionally, the favorable rates of hearing preservation achieved in children provide further evidence for the expansion of pediatric cochlear implant candidacy to include patients with greater degrees of residual hearing.
4:::Patients with UC might achieve clinical response or remission by utilizing some of these agents with a favorable side effect profile. Further studies are needed to evaluate their short- and long-term efficacy and safety.
4:::The establishment of international partnerships to support postgraduate training of physician anesthetists in Zambia has created a significant increase in the number of anesthesia providers and has further developed nearly all aspects of anesthetic practice. The facilitation of the training program by a global health partnership has leveraged high-level support for the project and provided opportunities for North-South and international learning.
4:::Minimizing cochlear trauma during implant insertion is important to preserve residual hearing and optimize audiological performance. An overall 17.6% trauma rate suggests that CI insertion could be improved with more accurate and consistent electrode insertion such as in the form of robotic guidance. The correlation of cochlea trauma with post-operative hearing has yet to be determined.
4:::The overall intra-institute and inter-institute agreement was moderate. Central lymph-node levels were the most critical and variability increased as the complexity of the patients anatomy increased. These findings might have an effect on the interpretation of results from multicenter and even mono-institute studies.'
4:::In this work we isolated two new isoflavanones (1 and 2), and one new isoflavone (3) with a weak antimycobacterial activity. The (3R) absolute configuration was assigned to 1 by computational analysis of its ECD spectrum and to 2 and 5 by similarity of their ECD spectra with that of 1. We are also reporting by first time, activity against virulent strain of M. tuberculosis for compounds 4 and 5 and their antimycobacterial synergistic effect.
4:::pCR was associated with favorable tumor factors, insurance status, time between radiation and surgery, and institutional volume. It is not clear what is driving the higher rates of pCR at high-volume institutions. Research targeted at understanding processes that are associated with pCR in high-volume institutions is needed so that similar results can be achieved across the spectrum of facilities caring for patients in this population.
4:::Thus, participants receiving rTMS treatment showed a clinically significant decrease in reported anxiety symptoms as measured by the HARS. rTMS may be a treatment options for patients treatment refractory to pharmacotherapies. www.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00616447.
4:::We have verified that the use of neoadjuvant CRT in the treatment of locally advanced rectal carcinoma leads to a possible achievement of pCR. But in our group of patients this was not predictable nor was it with the use of multiparametric 3T MRI.
4:::Practice leads to improvements in endovascular simulator procedure and fluoroscopy times, especially for more novice trainees. Initial operator performance gaps can be approximated with a few sessions to expected proficiency. Incorporation of endovascular simulators in residency training may assist in shortening the learning curve in rarer endovascular procedures.
4:::Although S had a protective effect on cardiac tissue it had no protective effect on thoracic aorta when administered with RT + T.
4:::A low LBM percentage increases the risk of inadequate GFR calculation by CG formula, and carboplatin overdosage with severe thrombocytopenia. High CrCl/GFRcysC-creat ratio allows the identification of these patients.
4:::LIPUS treatment can be an alternative to surgery for established nonunions. Given that no spontaneous healing of established nonunions is expected, and that it is challenging to test the efficacy of LIPUS for nonunion by randomized clinical trial, findings are compelling. LIPUS may be most useful in patients for whom surgery is high risk, including elderly patients at risk of delirium, or patients with dementia, extreme hypertension, extensive soft-tissue trauma, mechanical ventilation, metabolic acidosis, multiple organ failure, or coma. With an overall average success rate for LIPUS >80% this is comparable to the success of surgical treatment of non-infected nonunions.
4:::Our study demonstrates an increase in hospitalization for AF in diabetic women. Women were older, had a higher comorbidity index and had CHAD2DS2-VASc score than men. Women with AF and T2DM undergo ablation or pacemaker implantation less frequently than their male counterparts. After multivariable adjustment sex did not predict mortality during admissions for AF.
4:::Memantine add-on treatment may be beneficial for treating psychopathological symptoms (especially negative symptoms) in schizophrenia patients. The negative-symptom effect size may be associated with younger adult schizophrenia patients.
4:::Individuals with anhedonia are likely less flat' or 'blunted' than generally thought. Although replication is warranted, impairments in high-arousal positive emotions may be of particular interest in the clinical treatment of anhedonia.'
4:::No specific risk factors could be identified for postpartum ACPO. A postpartum patient with abdominal distension and pain should have appropriate imaging to rule out colonic dilatation and/or perforation. Perforation may occur with a caecal diameter of less than 9cm but it is more likely if the diameter exceeded 12cm. The mortality risk appears to be low in the postpartum group compared to other patients with ACPO. There is a need for establishing national level databases to capture all the relevant data in a consistent manner, to understand this rare disease process.
4:::Fatty liver is an independent risk factor for progression from metabolically healthy status to metabolically abnormal phenotype, even in non-overweight individuals.
4:::This meta-analysis shows prevalence of GDM that is at the upper end of previous estimates in Europe.
4:::The exclusion of food transit is responsible for significant drop in gastric output, hardly representing a risk factor in the remnant carcinogenesis, being unexposed to alimentary carcinogenic agents.
4:::Renal sympathetic denervation using the second generation EnligHTN Renal Denervation System resulted in safe, rapid, and significant mean office blood pressure reduction that was sustained through 24 months. Future studies will need to address the utility of this system against an appropriate sham based comparator.
4:::Findings of this study suggest a substantial prevalence of khat use among pregnant women in Ethiopia and highlight the role of socio-demographic and cultural influences on khat use during pregnancy. Health care professionals in the region where khat is available are encouraged to ask their female patients about khat use and encourage them to refrain from use while they are pregnant. The positive link between khat and mental distress warrants further research focusing on biological, psychological, and social mechanisms of this relationship.
4:::Deguelin could inhibit EMT and metastasis, while overexpression of NEK2 promotes these processes. Deguelin could decrease NEK2 expression, while NEK2 overexpression could restore deguelin-induced inhibition of metastasis.
4:::Self-reported disruption of body-image was significantly greater in pregnant women who were experiencing lumbopelvic pain than those who werent and the extent of body-image disruption was associated with pain intensity. Only pain related catastrophisation was related to disrupted body-image.'
4:::There is a discrepancy in costs of inpatient versus outpatient IBD management and treating active disease compared with disease in remission. Proactive care may help prevent disease reaching a severity whereby reactive management of active disease is required.
4:::Low prevalence of H. pylori infection, frequent duodenal location, and high rebleeding rate are characteristics of patients with bleeding gastroduodenal ulcer under antithrombotic medications. Continuation of antithrombotic medications can be accepted for bleeding gastroduodenal ulcer.
4:::Long-term mortality and morbidity post stroke and TIA have declined, confirming trends for improved long-term outcomes for patients clinically stable during the initial high-risk period. However, increased long-term rates of institutionalization also suggest that stroke and TIA patients are at risk of long-term functional decline, despite improved clinical outcomes. Further studies evaluating challenges for sustaining functional gains after stroke and TIA are required.
4:::Our results suggest that impaired fetal growth caused by prenatal air pollution exposure can lead to impaired infant growth during the first year of life. Furthermore, molecular adaptations in placental mtDNA are associated with postnatal consequences of air pollution induced alterations in growth.
4:::FIR should be considered as feasible and safe for the treatment of breast cancer related lymphedema patients 5years after mastectomy. FIR does not promote recurrence or metastasis of breast cancer and is a well-tolerated therapy with no adverse reactions.
4:::Cardiac surgical providers recognize distinct critical time points during cardiac surgery. However, there is a high degree of variability within and between disciplines as to the importance of these times, suggesting an absence of a shared mental model among disciplines caring for cardiac surgical patients during the perioperative period. A lack of a shared mental model could be one of the factors contributing to preventable errors in cardiac operating rooms.
4:::Lesions receiving an average dose greater than 50 Gy are likely to have a significant response. For lesions receiving less than 50 Gy, dose heterogeneity is a significant prognostic factor. Lesions receiving an average dose less than 20 Gy are unlikely to respond. A reduction in TLG may be associated with improved overall survival.
4:::These results extend previous findings demonstrating enhanced sensitivity to PAE-induced craniofacial dysmorphology and support the hypothesis that genetic alterations in the Shh signaling pathway influences the vulnerability to alcohol-induced birth defects. Moreover, these results emphasize the importance of understanding the interactions between genes and prenatal exposure to alcohol or other teratogens.

4:::Histoacryl Flexible showed the lowest leakage rate compared to the other TA groups and to the 4-suture control group. Glubran 2 showed the highest AL rate and a high inflammatory response. Histoacryl Flexible was associated with the presence of more mature collagen and seems to promote anastomotic healing.
4:::In conclusion, these results provide further lines of evidence that substantial molecular changes occur at the onset of the disease, identifying potential key players, which might be useful as biomarkers for diagnostics and development of medical treatment in the future.
4:::In vulnerable populations, the age factor appears sufficiently significant to justify creating models formulated for younger populations. The data also support attention to housing needs for people in treatment. Findings from this paper can inform future research and program development.
4:::The use of these scores in helping physicians to determine the patients with ARDS most likely to benefit from ECMO should be limited in clinical practice because of their relatively poor performance in predicting death in subjects with severe ARDS receiving ECMO support. Before widespread use is initiated, these scoring systems should be tested in large prospective studies of subjects with severe ARDS undergoing ECMO treatment.
4:::Pharmaco-epidemiological studies on psychotropic medication prescription after a disaster provide important information about population-level mental health. Our results suggest that the Sewol Ferry disaster exerted a harmful effect on the mental health status of the affected community.
4:::We found a very low prevalence of DVAs on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in patients <1 year old which was significantly lower than other age groups. These findings suggest that postnatal changes in venous architecture and drainage patterns may contribute to the development of DVAs.
4:::DAN is safe, feasible, and associated with faster times of hospital arrival to recanalization. The clinical benefit of this approach should be assessed in a prospective randomized trial.
4:::The KOP-Q shows to function uniformly across both language groups and can therefore be used to assess nurses knowledge and their certainty about this knowledge which can be important for educational and/or quality improvement programs in the USA. Furthermore, the KOP-Q is suitable to make comparisons between the Netherlands and the USA using latent variable models. Before the KOP-Q can be used in other countries, cross-cultural tests should again be performed.'
4:::Acute infarct volume is a poor predictor of HRQOL domains after ischemic stroke, with the exception of the cognitive domain. Overall, clinical and imaging variables explained <50% of the variance in HRQOL outcomes at 3 months. Our data imply that a broad range of factors, some known and others undiscovered, may better predict poststroke HRQOL than what is currently available.
4:::The DPV registry provides data from real-life diabetes care. Our analysis predominantly confirmed results from clinical trials and provides additional information complementing the clinical study program of degludec.
4:::If the duration between TIA symptom onset and initial DWI is <2 hours, a repeat examination should be performed to minimize the risk of false-positive findings.
4:::This study showed that the FilmArray BioThreat-E test performs comparably to conventional molecular tests under field conditions, providing results and interpretation in approximately 1h. Due to its operational characteristics, it can be easily deployed in the field during an epidemic and could also be a useful tool for post-outbreak surveillance.
4:::Simeprevir-based triple therapy with reduced doses of PEG-IFN and ribavirin was safe and effective for IFN ineligible patients infected with genotype 1b HCV. IL28B polymorphism status was a useful predictor of the SVR.

4:::In a large community sample from four cities in the US, early age of onset of drunkenness predicts mortality risk. We discuss experiments to investigate the possible causal significance of this predictive association.
4:::Partial scalar invariance in two items may not have a strong impact in the calculation of the overall depression score. Given evidence for functional invariance, results provide support for the use of the14-item, three-factor CES-D scale to assess depression symptoms among Hispanic college students.
4:::Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis, unlike other paraneoplastic or autoimmune encephalitides, affects those 18 years and under an estimated 40% of the time based on prior studies. Recognizing the signs and symptoms of this condition is essential to making a diagnosis and initiating timely treatment. Child psychiatrists have an important role in this disorder.
4:::The overall performance of ARCHITECT and BioPlex was superior to Centaur, especially for detection of acute HIV infection.
4:::Ga-DOTATATA PET/CT could be the nuclear medicine imaging choice to evaluate suspected primary pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma, especially in the situation of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome.
4:::Physiologic distribution of Ga-PSMA comprises uptake in lacrimal and salivary glands, vocal cords, Waldeyer ring, liver, spleen, and kidneys as well as various parts of the intestine. Moreover, nonspecific tracer uptake is regularly found in the thyroid and the synovia of the knee. Incidental Ga-PSMA uptake can occasionally reveal nonprostate cancer-associated remodeling processes, such as fibrous dysplasia.
4:::Self-reported smoking and serum cotinine test ≥ 10ng/ml are accurate ,complementary and more reliable methods to assess the patients smoking status and could be used in studies evaluating serum samples in large population and multicenter studies.'
4:::Although the main indication of CBCT of the maxillary sinus in dentistry is sinus floor elevation/treatment planning and evaluation prior to dental implant placement, this imaging modality is increasingly also used for endodontic and periodontal purposes. There is no consensus regarding the cutoff point beyond which mucosal thickening of the maxillary sinus should be regarded as pathological, and the definition of maxillary sinusitis moreover varies greatly in the scientific literature. In this regard, international consensus is required in relation to these concepts, with a clear distinction between healthy and diseased maxillary sinuses.
4:::Antibiotic prophylaxis in comatose patients reduced the incidence of EO-VAP and decreased the ICU stay slightly. Future trials are needed to confirm these results.
4:::Low-dose alteplase may improve outcomes in thrombolysis-treated acute ischemic stroke patients on prior APT, but this requires further evaluation in a randomized controlled trial.
4:::We believe this method may be useful in improving reproducibility, assessing safety, and ultimately aiding understanding of mechanisms of action in electrical and magnetic neuromodulation modalities.
4:::Multimodal interventions can improve long-term perception of recovery, as well as balance, gait, grip strength, and working memory in a mixed population of individuals in late phase after stroke.
4:::Good control of diabetes and hypertension comorbidity with pharmacological treatment in elderly patients is challenging. Some drug combinations achieved better control than others. The greatest effort should focus on improving the low adherence to diabetes treatment.
4:::This study demonstrates that there are distinct sleep quality subtypes in children that could have implications for HRQOL. These findings may inform future strategies to promote improved sleep and HRQOL in children.
4:::Calcium volume scoring thresholds which are relative to LA are more predictive of PVR post-TAVR than those which use fixed cutoffs. A threshold of LA+100 HU had the highest predictive value.
4:::The partial strong invariance of the ISI supports that it is a valid outcome measure for CBT-I. In contrast, various changes in the factor model of the PSQI indicate that it may not be an appropriate outcome measure for CBT-I. Some possible causes for the changes of the constructs of the PSQI following CBT-I are discussed.
4:::The present study shows abnormal spontaneous brain activity in PMS patients revealed by fALFF, which could provide neuroimaging evidence to further improve our understanding of the underlying neural mechanism of PMS.
4:::This study shows that sleep quality and fragmentation are closely related to atrophic changes in hippocampus and putamen. In addition, atrophic changes in global subcortical structures are associated with impaired cognitive function in patients with chronic insomnia.
4:::We observed no difference in DFS, OS, or MSS between the 2 groups. Pregnant patients should be screened for melanoma in a similar manner to nonpregnant patients and should be counseled that their survival is not adversely affected by their pregnancy.
4:::Breastfeeding discontinuation and cesarean section delivery were associated with PPD during the 6-month postpartum period. Our results support the implementation of breastfeeding promoting policies, and PPD screening and treatment programs during the early postpartum period.
4:::Maternal depressive symptoms and pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms were both associated with decrements in visuospatial working memory/executive functioning. Depressive symptoms seem to present more stable relationship with cognitive deficits, while pregnancy-related anxiety was associated only concurrently. Future studies could investigate, how stable these cognitive differences are, and whether they affect maternal ability to deal with demands of pregnancy and later parenting.
4:::Our study shows that in hospitalised patients with metastatic oesophageal or gastric cancer, the use of chemotherapy decreases while the use of artificial nutrition increases as death approaches. This raises important questions, as clinical guidelines clearly recommend to limit the use of artificial nutrition in contexts of limited life expectancy.
4:::While social prescribing may help patients self-esteem and well-being, it may not decrease GP workload. Further research is required to optimise social prescribing benefits.'
4:::The MSCRQ appears to be a reliable and valid measure of metacognitions about self-critical rumination whilst the MCQ-30 is a better predictor of general emotional distress.
4:::Student nurses started their studies with many dreams, such as caring for people and having the opportunity to deliver excellent nursing care. When their expectations were not met, their dreams became disappointments which caused them to consider stopping and even to leave (attrition). The role of lecturers and mentors seems invaluable in protecting and guiding students through their programme and placements. Optimal cooperation between lecturers and mentors is of paramount importance to retain student nurses in their training programmes.
4:::Taking part in sport clubs increases the risk of sports related injuries in adolescents with and without LTID, but not with affected LTID. Few adolescents with affected LTID participate in sports clubs and were less likely to report the most serious type of injury to be from sports. These results could be used for devising sports based injury prevention and health promotion strategies for children with LTID.
4:::Firefighters perceive cancer risks as the result of performing essential job tasks and from indirect job factors related to being a firefighter. The two categories of cancer risks suggest different points of entry for intervention.
4:::(1) A somewhat below-norm level of respiratory parameters among preterm-born girls entering pubescence may attest to continued negative impact on their respiratory system. (2) A significant improvement in their spirometric results 1 year later may indicate that pubescence helps compensate for the earlier negative effect of preterm birth. (3) No significant differences were seen in lung function in preterm-born adults as compared with a reference group of adults, although the preterm-born group did exhibit lower values of all parameters studied and more frequent obstructive disorders.
4:::This first-in-human study of ABP-700 shows that ABP-700 was safe and well tolerated after single-bolus injections up to 1.00 mg/kg. Bolus doses of 0.25 and 0.35 mg/kg were found to provide the most beneficial clinical effect versus side-effect profile.
4:::OJ reduces inflammatory response, and this probably explains its positive impact on the prostatitis associated inflammation.
4:::In patients with narcolepsy, JZP-110 significantly improved the ability to stay awake compared with placebo, with large effect sizes using both the 40-min and 20-min censored MWT data.
4:::The kinetics of collagen type I and III synthesis in DCM move in opposite directions, with production of collagen type I consistently increasing, and the synthesis of collagen type III decreasing. Levels of TGF and CTGF, which are proven fibrosis-stimulating factors, had a tendency to decrease. Regardless of disease duration or fibrosis status, the kinetics of serum markers of collagen synthesis, TGF and CTGF were similar in DCM. A better understanding of the kinetics of serum markers of fibrosis in DCM may help to develop more tailored therapeutic approaches to fibrosis.
4:::Our study validated Skindex symptom, Skindex function and SCI social subscales for QoL measurement during treatment with topical 5-FU. The study could not provide evidence for construct validity of the other subscales. Skindex was more responsive than SCI in the context of 5-FU treatment.
4:::We described the largest cohort of severe systemic capillary-leak syndrome flares requiring ICU admission. High-volume fluid therapy was independently associated with poorer outcomes. IV immunoglobulin use was not associated with improved survival; hence, their use should be considered prudently and needs further evaluation in future studies.
4:::Double prepuncture is a useful technical adjunct both for simultaneous endovenous ablation of multiple adjacent incompetent veins and when catheter passage is impeded. This technique aids in efficient and successful application of endovenous ablation to complex venous anatomy.
4:::Low volume hospitals were less likely to screen by skeletal survey, but head CT ratios were not affected by ED volume. Low volume hospitals were also less likely to admit or transfer.
4:::An affective continuum strongly associated with mood and anxious comorbidity emerged in AN. Such an evaluation could have several research and clinical implications given the need of improving treatment individualization and early interventions for such a complex disorder.
4:::IVL with IVCE or ICE is a rare disease with nonspecific manifestations. Surgery is the primary treatment. The postoperative recurrence rate is high, and postoperative antiestrogen hormone therapy is not significantly correlated with recurrence.
4:::Pain and depressive symptoms are associated in patients with dementia. Because reduced pain is associated with less depressive symptoms, these patients should be assessed regularly for untreated pain. The benefit of analgesic treatment should be weighed carefully against the potential for adverse effects.
4:::Our study demonstrates a survival advantage of the use of HIPEC as a prophylactic strategy and suggests that patients whose disease burden is limited to positive cytology and limited nodal involvement may benefit the most from HIPEC. For patients with extensive carcinomatosis, the completeness of cytoreductive surgery is a critical prognostic factor for survival. Future RCTs should better define patient selection criteria.
4:::A choriovitelline placenta is not formed early in gestation nor is it present at term. Early in development invasive trophoblast spreads laterally to form a trophoblastic plate. We found evidence to support the idea that the colugo placenta is intermediate between the labyrinthine placenta of rodents and the trabecular type of Neotropical primates.
4:::Large PVs exhibit thrombosis more frequently than HVs during MW ablation procedures. Biologic differences in thrombogenicity, rather than heat transfer, between PVs and HVs may contribute to their different rates of thrombosis.
4:::Among cT1-2 N0 pN(+) esophageal cancer patients, adjuvant chemotherapy may be sufficient for margin-negative patients, whereas adjuvant chemoradiation therapy appears necessary for margin-positive patients. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm the results.
4:::MIS techniques successfully stabilized ASD patients with Group 0 and + deformities and improved HRQoL. This study suggests that severe sagittal imbalance is not adequately treated with MIS approaches.
4:::Although, the ICS group was expected to have more adverse long-term clinical outcomes, it was not associated with the increased incidence of major adverse clinical outcomes compared with the non-ICS group up to 3years. Longer term follow-up studies are needed.
4:::Our results indicated that MEPM-SMA-DDST was the most cost-effective assay for the detection of IMP-producing isolates. Therefore, we conclude that MEPM-SMA-DDST is the optimal available assay for clinical first-line screening in IMP-endemic areas such as Japan. However, this assay could not detect NDM-producing isolates, whereas the Etest MP/MPI and MAST-CDS could. When MEPM-SMA-DDST is negative, the Etest MP/MPI and MAST-CDS could be used to obtain supportive data and prevent detection failure for NDM-producing isolates.
4:::In this retrospective study with over 5000 patients, implantation of both trifocal IOL models provided good functional distance, intermediate, and near visual acuity, resulting in high levels of both spectacle independence and patient satisfaction.
4:::Our findings indicate that miR-372 has a prominent role in inhibiting tumor growth and it is a valuable target for ovarian cancer therapy.
4:::In veteran patients hospitalized for HF, pharmacist-managed HF bridge clinic significantly reduced the time to initial follow-up compared with usual care. Improved short-term outcomes and trend toward improvement of longer-term outcomes in bridge clinic patients was shown.
4:::Respiratory failure secondary to progressive obstructive lung disease during infancy may be the presenting phenotype of FLNA-associated periventricular nodular heterotopia. We describe a cohort of patients with progressive respiratory failure related to a pathogenic variant in FLNA and present lung transplantation as a viable therapeutic option for this group of patients.
4:::There are no substantial clinically relevant differences in the risk of cardiovascular events, including hospitalization for heart failure, between 3 of the DPP-4 inhibitors and placebo.

4:::The visual guides that we have generated for scoring atherosclerotic luminal narrowing of coronary arteries should be helpful for a broad group of pathologists, from beginning pathology residents to experienced cardiovascular pathologists.
4:::Detection of HR-HPV type-specific antibodies highly correlated with HPV-attributable OPSCC and was associated with better survival. HR-HPV antibodies are promising diagnostic, prognostic and potentially screening markers in HR-HPV-attributable OPSCC.
4:::Rivaroxaban (10 mg/d) for 5 to 10 days seems to be an efficacious and safe alternative for EHIT prophylaxis in EVLA with or without phlebectomy.
4:::Our findings provide insight into fMRI predictive measures of treatment response to rTMS treatment, and demonstrate the potential of RSNs-based biomarkers in predicting response to rTMS treatment. Future studies are needed to validate the application of these measures to inform individual treatment indications.
4:::This is the largest meta-analysis for GWES in MDD. The examination of convergence of genome-wide evidence and of the functional enrichment analysis provides a global overview of potential neural signaling mechanisms dysregulated in MDD. Our comprehensive analysis of several brain regions identified lists of DE genes for MDD that are interesting candidates for further studies.

4:::We developed and validated two prediction models for predicting the 6-month risk of hypoglycemia. The 16-variable model had slightly better performance than the 6-variable model, but in some practice settings, use of the simpler model may be preferred.
4:::Lung ultrasound had high diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of radiographically-confirmed pneumonia. Added benefits of lung ultrasound include rapid testing and high inter-rater agreement. Lung ultrasound may serve as an alternative tool for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia.
4:::This analysis demonstrated that the SGRQ has acceptable psychometric properties in patients with severe asthma, exceeding the thresholds for adequate reliability, validity and responsiveness. The SGRQ appears to be a good instrument for identifying response to therapy in patients with severe asthma.
4:::We statistically tested the transitions between time-variant exposure sub-groups and transitions in individual-level syringe coverage. Our results give important insights into means of improving coverage at the individual level, suggesting that methamphetamine injectors should be targeted, whilst both OST prescription and NSP should be expanded.
4:::Although several instruments have been used to assess the impact of COPD on caregivers, an increased understanding of their properties is needed before their widespread implementation.
4:::More than ¾ of the blood samples testing positive for THC, among subjects apprehended in Norway, also tested positive for CBD, suggesting frequent consumption of high CBD cannabis products. The simultaneous presence of CBD in blood does, however, not appear to affect THC-induced impairment on a CTI. Seizure sample analysis did not reveal high potency cannabis products, and while CBD content appeared high in hashish, it was almost absent in marijuana.
4:::Findings from this meta-analysis indicate an eveningness orientation is somewhat associated with more severe mood symptoms. Chronobiological approaches may contribute to the prevention and treatment of depressive disorders.
4:::We showed that after long-term expansion, phenotype of bmMSCs and ucMSCs remains stable and cells exhibit similar immunogenic properties compared with lower passage cells. However, immunosuppressive properties of MSCs are reduced. These findings reveal the consequences of application of higher passage MSCs in the clinic, which will help increase the yield of therapeutic MSCs but may interfere with their efficacy.
4:::The results suggest a promising electrophysiological approach to identifying individuals with convergence insufficiency and a history of concussion.
4:::Betadine 5% application significantly decreases epithelial integrity of the cornea, decreases functional vision, and increases subjective complaints.
4:::Frey syndrome is common after parotidectomy. Tumor size is the only statistically significant predictor of its development. Routine preventive interventions, for example, use of acellular dermal matrix, dermofat graft or muscle flaps to prevent Frey syndrome, should be considered for high risk patients.
4:::In BRAF- and RAS-mutant patients, cetuximab- and bevacizumab-based treatment had comparable survival times. ETS represents an early parameter associated with the benefit from anti-EGFR, while this was not the case with vascular endothelial growth factor A blockade.
4:::The prevalence of PCLs detected by magnetic resonance imaging in a preventive medical examination was 13.7%. Pancreatic cystic lesions were significantly associated with DM and obesity.
4:::Our study confirms rapid and deep ovarian reserve alteration in young women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer, and shows moderate AMH recovery in some patients. Although AMH cannot alone predict fertility potential, these new data emphasise the need for post-treatment ovarian insufficiency follow-up, strongly support the use of fertility preservation strategies and may provide new tools for improved counselling.
4:::PolyVD significantly increased the risk of major cardiovascular events and all-cause death in the asymptomatic community population. Performing invasive screening tests for polyVD is useful in the high-risk asymptomatic population.
4:::Exosomal markers (CD63 and CD9) expression assessment using immunohistochemistry is feasible in RPS. The expression of CD63 and CD9 is higher in PTs and malignant PTs compared with their ANTs.
4:::Our results showed that MEG3/miR-421/E-cadherin regulatory axis may be a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer.
4:::We demonstrate poor concordance between sPFT and sEUS suggesting that a combined shortened functional and structural test using a single instrument may not be a feasible test for diagnosis of suspected CP when a cutoff of 80 mEq/L is used.
4:::We observed response and resistance to alkylating agents in MGMT-deficient and MGMT-intact tumors. O-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase status should not guide alkylating agent therapy in WD panNETs.
4:::A Research and EBP course is an effective way to improve student perceptions of and confidence in research and EBP, increasing the likelihood of applying these skills to future nursing practice.
4:::Experiences in coordinating care for women Veterans with gynecologic malignancies receiving concurrent VA and community cancer care reveal challenges inherent in delivering care across health care systems, as well as potential approaches for addressing them.
4:::This paper provides evidence for the cumulative health impact of stressful life events, both those that are perpetrated against an individual (violence) and those undertaken with a degree of personal agency (caregiving). The findings underscore the need to understand the drivers of poor health, for clinicians to ask about life circumstances of patients experiencing poor health, and for the provision of referral pathways for complex cases.
4:::Disparities between UB-SDM educational efforts and entrenched dental practice cultures must be addressed in order for our graduates to fully embrace BP and CBS assessments in practice.
4:::The implementation of the ACA in California has helped reduce some of the disparities in health care access, utilization, and medication use between non-Latino whites and Mexican-heritage Latinos with hypertension. However, sustained progress is threatened by looming repeals of ACA provisions.
4:::Current major depression or depression symptoms may promote tobacco dependence, persistence and relapse by increasing sensitivity to both acute negative mood and abstinence induced tobacco-seeking behavior. Treatments should seek to break the association between adverse states and smoking to cope.
4:::Odds of stroke after cardiac surgery are increased in patients with a low minimum PaO2 within 24 hours of surgery. Results should be validated in an independent cohort. Further characterizing the underlying etiology of hypoxic episodes will be important to improve patient outcomes.
4:::Anterior lumbar interbody fusion with PPF can be an effective treatment choice and yield good clinical outcomes in patients with multiple-level isthmic spondylolisthesis.
4:::Results supported the conclusion that pain catastrophizing and sex moderate the relationship between pain intensity and opioid prescription. Although men and women patients had similar Pain Catastrophizing Scale scores, historically ""subthreshold"" levels of pain catastrophizing were significantly associated with opioid prescription only for women patients. These findings suggest that pain intensity and catastrophizing contribute to different patterns of opioid prescription for men and women patients, highlighting a potential need for examination and intervention in future studies.
4:::Loss of the STS could not distinguish between PD and Parkinson-Plus patients. The STS can be identified at both 1.5 T and 3 T.
4:::Agreement between gastroenterologists and IBD patients regarding the presence of clinically significant anxiety or depression was low, with no further action taken after consultation for 50% of patients who were identified by gastroenterologists as being anxious or depressed. This study highlights the need for educating gastroenterologists to improve their ability to identify IBD patient distress.
4:::Study results suggest that MBSR(BC) affects cytokine levels in BCS, mainly with increases in TNFα and IL-6. The data further suggest that B-cell modulation may be a part of immune recovery during breast cancer management and that increases in TNFα and IL-6 may be markers for MBSR(BC)-related recovery.
4:::Eight-weeks of FES can benefit the gait pattern of people with MS under non-fatigued and fatigued conditions. Implications for rehabilitation In some people with MS prolonged use of FES may be necessary before observing positive orthotic effects. Improvements in the neuromuscular control of the more affected lower limb may develop with prolonged use of FES in people with MS. Only some therapeutic benefits of FES are maintained during fatigued walking in people with MS. FES may be considered as a gait retraining device as well as an orthotic intervention for people with MS.
4:::Results indicate that female sex workers do not have an increased risk for E. histolytica infection in Durango City, Mexico. Further studies to determine the risk of infection with E. histolytica by sexual contact should be conducted.
4:::These data can be used by long-term care clinicians to assist in planning interventions and care approaches which promote physical activity and good sleep practices, and are individualized to physical and cognitive capabilities. Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12614000508673).
4:::GTN patients with FIGO score≥12 have a poor prognosis. More emphasis should be placed on non-molar antecedent pregnancy, brain metastases, and previous multiagent chemotherapy failure. Moreover, salvage surgery may improve the prognosis. Floxuridine-based multiagent chemotherapy is effective with manageable toxicity for ultra high-risk GTN patients.
4:::These data demonstrate chest compliance increases significantly over time as demonstrated by the significant increase in the measured AP distance after 5min of CPR. These findings suggest that adjustments in compression and decompression forces may be needed to optimize CPR over time.
4:::Smoking history predicted for efficacy with a veliparib-chemotherapy combination; toxicity was acceptable regardless of smoking history. A prespecified analysis of recent smokers is planned for ongoing phase 3 studies of veliparib in NSCLC.
4:::The data collected through this study demonstrate a significant increase in systemic ADMA levels following major laparoscopic colorectal surgery.
4:::Circulating PCSK9 is associated with NODAT in RTRs. The PCSK9 pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis of NODAT.
4:::No clinical evidence was found to indicate that African Americans should be more often deemed ineligible for HCV treatment than other racial groups. Diabetes and renal disease do not fully explain the HCV treatment ineligibility racial disparity, because HCV patients with these conditions are priority patients for HCV treatment because of their greater risk for cirrhosis, steatosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The findings suggest that an underlying contributor to the HCV treatment eligibility disparity disfavoring African Americans could be racial discrimination.
4:::Higher proportion of NK cells expressing inhibitory CD158b and CD158e receptors is associated with significant liver injury.
4:::Patients with IPVD appear to have a substantial risk of developing oxygenation impairment over time and progress to HPS. In our cohort, survival in patients with HPS and isolated IPVD is not different when compared to those without IPVDs.
4:::Nurses in inpatient pediatric care settings that care for fewer patients each and practice in a professionally supportive work environment miss care less often, increasing quality of patient care.
4:::A detailed framework for a structured TaTME training curriculum has been proposed. It encompasses various training modalities and assessment, as well as having the potential to provide quality control and future research initiatives for this novel technique.
4:::Based on these results, it is concluded that osseointegration of MDIs is similar to that of standard implants.
4:::Mini-laparoscopy can be safely and effectively used to perform benign adnexal mass surgery.
4:::Ulcers recurred in a minority of CEAP clinical C5 and C6 patients after EVTA of the saphenous veins. Ulcer recurrence was less frequent in patients without concomitant deep venous reflux and in those treated with phlebectomy of varicose veins at the time of EVTA. We suggest consideration of phlebectomy at the time of EVTA for patients with C5 and C6 venous insufficiency, particularly in those with isolated superficial venous insufficiency.
4:::In patients with central vein occlusion and exhaustion of conventional insertion sites, a tunneled central venous catheter can be safely placed through SVC puncture by the transcutaneous route.
4:::Although band 3 peptides 241-251 and 282-296 induced to the highest IL-10 production by CD4 T cells in vitro but fail to reverse the RBC autoantibody response in vivo. Modifications to improve solubility these peptides might help to modulate the immune response toward a T helper-2 profile and decrease the severity of anemia.
4:::Autochthonous HEV infection is a clinical issue with increasing burden. Future work should focus on increasing awareness of HEV infection in the developed world, emphasising the need for clinicians to have a low threshold for HEV testing, particularly in immunosuppressed patients. Patients at potential risk of chronic HEV infection must also be educated and given advice regarding prevention of infection.
4:::To date, this is the first study to report the costs of failed primary instrumented lumbar fusions using ICBG and subsequent secondary fusions using rhBMP-2 from a primary payer perspective. On the basis of this evidence, a policy of using rhBMP-2 in all patients undergoing a primary instrumented lumbar fusion cannot be recommended.
4:::Post-marketing data confirm the excellent safety of vedolizumab observed in registration trials. The signal of post-operative complications should be interpreted with caution, but warrants further study. Although comparative studies are needed, Vedolizumab may be a safe alternative in patients who best avoid systematic immunosuppression, including those pre-disposed to infection, malignancy or the elderly.
4:::The effects of childhood chronic physical illness on the risk of emotional problems persist beyond childhood and adolescence. Mental health prevention and intervention strategies targeting children with chronic physical illnesses can have long-term benefits.
4:::The present study showed positive correlation between the volume of removed disc tissue and decrease in postoperative ISV and ISH. There were no statistically significant differences in ISV and ISH between the group with end-plate perforation and the control group 6 months after lumbar discectomy. Clinical outcome and disability were significantly improved in both groups 3 and 6 months after surgery.
4:::The reproducibility of assigning the IETA color score for assessing endometrial vascularization using 3-dimensional volumes is good or very good regardless of the experience of the examiner.
4:::Self-reported pain was reduced with MT and sham ultrasound treatment 24 hours after treatment, but inflammatory markers within venous circulation and quantitative sensory tests were unable to differentiate between study groups. Therefore, we were unable to characterize mechanisms underlying chronic LBP.
4:::Lumbar retrolisthesis, together with thoracolumbar kyphosis, appears to be associated with mechanisms associated with regulation of sagittal balance. Low PI and disk instability due to degeneration may contribute to the development and progression of retrolisthesis.
4:::The Siremobil Iso-C 3D provides high-quality 3D scans in slender spine regions (eg, cervical spine), whereas the Vision FD Vario 3D appears to have advantages in the lumbar spine. Further evolution and novel devices are needed to optimize image quality and handling.
4:::TB incident rate among patients with type 2 diabetes was substantially higher among men than among women. The risk of TB was reversely associated with initial BMI. The severity of poor glucose control among patients with diabetes was also linearly associated with the risk of TB.
4:::Smaller DCSA in the early postoperative period was associated with radicular pain after lumbar decompression surgery. The best cutoff value for postoperative radicular pain was 67.7 mm. Absence of a suction drain at the time of early postoperative MRI was related to smaller DCSA.
4:::This study identifies Adal as a genetically protective factor against alcohol consumption in mice, in which elevated Adal levels contribute to low alcohol preference.
4:::The reported practice of Australian paediatricians is not consistent with international standards on CMA. Australian practice could be improved by a standardised approach to ordering CMA, consenting patients and interpreting results. We provide resources for CMA ordering and make recommendations about preparation for next generation sequencing.
4:::Computer-assisted navigation facilitated minimally invasive spine surgery-TLIF. CAMISS-TLIF was superior to open TLIF for treating 1-level degenerative lumbar disease, although it required longer operation time in the initial stage. CAMISS-TLIF showed several benefits compared with open TLIF, including less intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, and pain; earlier rehabilitation; and shorter postoperative hospitalization.
4:::Almost half of the oncology nurses providing advice on nutrition and PA perceived themselves as having insufficient knowledge to be able to provide such advice. In particular, younger oncology nurses and oncology nurses with an intermediate vocational education may benefit most from education about these topics.  .
4:::The outcomes reported in clinical trials involving children with CKD are extremely heterogeneous and are most often surrogate outcomes, rather than clinical and patient-centered outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and quality of life. Efforts to ensure consistent reporting of outcomes that are important to patients and clinicians will improve the value of trials to guide clinical decision-making. In our study, non-English articles were excluded.
4:::This review highlights the inconsistencies in measuring or assessing hyperglycemia and the lack of standardized guidelines in treating hyperglycemia. Failure to have a standard approach to the measurement and management of hyperglycemia impedes the ability of healthcare providers to determine the significance of its impact on health outcomes. Further research is needed to establish appropriate measurement guidelines to address hyperglycemia in people with cancer. .
4:::People who are at risk or vaccinated regularly display a higher vaccine uptake and better knowledge of influenza and vaccination. The opinions and attitudes of this study population may assist in developing strategies for changing attitudes of the public toward influenza vaccination.
4:::Findings from this study may guide the timing of interventions that could improve school achievement among survivors.  .
4:::The findings suggest that gender had a minimal effect on physical health and no effect on physical activity levels in older caregivers. Depression and poor sleep quality were high in some caregivers but did not predict physical activity levels.  .
4:::Based on these results, the specific emotions of shame and guilt contextualized to the body differentially predict BCS health motivations and behavior over time. .'
4:::Most nurses working with patients with cancer are interested in the integration of CIM into supportive cancer care.  .
4:::Our results and early experience suggests that the less-invasive retroperitoneal approach is safe and effective for anterior lumbar surgery. Compared with the conventional approach, significantly better postoperative rehabilitation and abdominal muscle preservation were seen with this novel approach.
4:::Our findings indicate that markers of endothelial damage are elevated in RP patients who subsequently develop SSc or other CTDs, even in the absence of capillaroscopic abnormalities.
4:::Seventy-four percent of patients after ADR met strict clinical success after 2-year follow-up. The clinical success versus failure rate did not change from their 3-month follow-up in 85 of the 91 patients (93%). Overall clinical success may be improved most by patient selection and implant type.
4:::Under combination therapy, AZA dose reduction, but not withdrawal, appears to be as effective as continuation of AZA at full dose.
4:::Moral distress, resulting from therapeutic obstinacy and the provision of futile care, is an important issue among critical care providers team, and it was significantly associated with severe burnout.'
4:::Maternal BMI and glycemia have metabolic signatures that are both shared and unique to each phenotype. These signatures largely remain consistent across different ancestry groups and may contribute to the common and independent effects of these two phenotypes on adverse pregnancy outcomes.
4:::IHC4 was strongly predictive of pCR or near pCR in ER+ breast cancers following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Ki67 was an important component of this predictive ability, but was not as predictive as IHC4.
4:::The results indicate that in Japan, the rates of the major causes of visual impairment altered in the most recent 10-year period reflecting the recent changes in the social background and advances in ocular and systemic treatment.
4:::The most critical period was the first 2 months of dialysis initiation. Patients who were older, female, diabetic and hypertensive had higher risk of early mortality. Our analysis highlighted that the transitional period from sever CKD stages to dialysis initiation, when optimal supportive care should be adopted, was crucial for patients survival.'
4:::CCXBB achieved significant horizontal crestal width allowing for staged implant placement in most of the patients. In light of the histological outcomes and implant failures, special attention must be placed to prevent soft tissue dehiscence when CCXBB is used in severe atrophic alveolar crests.
4:::This 10-year descriptive study, the largest cohort to date, provides early respiratory samples from seawater drowning patients. The microorganisms retrieved were either mostly part of the human oro-pharyngeal flora or Enterobacteriaceae and displayed low rates of antimicrobial resistance. Respiratory samples should nonetheless be collected at admittance to the ICU to avoid inappropriate treatment. Empiric use of cephalosporin could be restricted to severe patients or if Gram-negative bacilli are found after direct examination.

4:::The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of CA may protect tissues such as the liver from diabetes-induced oxidative damage.
4:::The findings of the present study suggest that an anatomic association exists between recalcitrant postoperative radiculopathy and NFB following an MIS-TLIF with BMP. Increased total bone growth as measured on serial axial and sagittal sections was associated with postoperative radiculopathy. The association between radiculopathy and the extension of BMP-induced bone growth toward the traversing nerve root appeared the most significant.
4:::This study establishes normative macular GC-IPL and RNFL thickness in children with refractive errors. Our results suggest that high definition optical coherence tomography RNFL parameters and minimum GC-IPL are not affected by AL or myopia in children, and therefore warrants further evaluation in pediatric glaucoma patients.
4:::A multifaceted intervention was associated with improved compliance with evidence-based interventions and decreases in ventilator-associated event, infection-related ventilator-associated complication, and probable ventilator-associated pneumonia. Our study is the largest to date affirming that best practices can prevent ventilator-associated events.
4:::The detection of EXT-1 in both mature and newly-differentiated cells indicates a role in the odontoblast function, and EXT-1 staining in the predentin indicates a function in the dentin formation. Detection of EXT-1 in developing teeth indicates a role in tooth development.
4:::Our results suggest that ambient exposure to BTEXS, particularly benzene, may be associated with hematologic effects, including decreased hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and increased red cell distribution width.
4:::This study demonstrates an age-dependent decrease in width of the pubic symphysis and left and right SI joints. By contrast, the widths of the triradiate cartilage remain relatively stable until closure.

4:::The results of this study demonstrated that plain radiographs alone can be used to classify and manage most pediatric fractures, confirming Silber previous findings. Furthermore, we recommend the specific instances of Schreck and Haasz et al in which CT scans should be used, sparing the general pediatric population unnecessary radiation. Such cases include patients with an abnormal abdominal or pelvic examination, complex fracture patterns, displacement greater than 1 cm, femur deformities, hematuria, Glasgow Coma Scale <13, hemodynamic instability, an aspartate aminotransferase > 200 U/L, an Hct < 30%, or an abnormal chest x-ray.
4:::Primary PVS still has a guarded prognosis in the current era despite adoption of the sutureless technique. Postoperative pulmonary hypertension and severity of disease evaluated by a new severity score are independent prognostic factors regardless of surgical technique.

4:::The NASS allows for a comprehensive description of IVF cycles in women ≥40 years in the USA. Although live birth rate is less than 20%, identifying factors associated with IVF success can facilitate treatment option counseling.
4:::T2 dark strands and fascial tail are characteristic features of awdt, whereas other subjective/qualitative findings are not useful. Quantitative findings such as ADC measurements and DCE curve analysis may have additional value to differentiate awdt from ndawt, but will require further analysis.
4:::The fluorescence-based methodologies proved to be sensitive and rapid in detecting phase separation, even at the nanoscale, in the ITZ-HPMC ASDs. Fluorescence-based methods thus show promise for miscibility evaluation of spray-dried ASDs.
4:::Conservative treatment along with oral anticoagulation may be reasonable for some AVAs, but to date, there is no clear guideline or evidence-based threshold for surgical or interventional therapy. In review of the existing data and from our clinical and scientific knowledge, interventional or surgical treatment should strongly be considered in cases with clinical symptoms, pulmonary embolism or pulmonary arterial hypertension, thrombus formation within the AVA in patients with oral anticoagulation or for patients with a contraindication to oral anticoagulants, considerable increase in diameter or compression of adjacent structures, saccular AVA, or an underlying connective tissue disease. The most common procedure is surgical ligation of the AVA, although endovascular occlusion of the aneurysms is becoming more frequent.
4:::Our results provide evidence for MCP-1 involvement in the development of PVVs and indicate that inflammation could be implicated in the pathogenesis of this condition.
4:::Whole-liver CT-texture analysis has potential to predict patients at risk of developing early liver metastases ≤6 months, but is not robust enough to identify patients at risk of developing metastases at later stage.
4:::N/L ratio may be used as a prognostic marker for patients with odontogenic infections. These patients may need a higher dose of antibiotics and stay more than 1 day in hospital for the treatment of odontogenic infection when the N/L ratio is detected to be more than 5.19.
4:::Urinary concentrations of OH-PAHs, especially 9-OHPhe, were elevated in Chongqing Children compared to children in other countries. Being female, older age, school location near an industrial site, frequent consumption of smoked foods and lower family income were all associated with higher OH-PAHs concentrations. Further cohort studies are needed to confirm the associations between potential exposure sources and childrens exposure to PAHs, in order to provide recommendations to reduce exposure.'

4:::Autofluorescence analysis in BRSC patients contributes to evaluating disease activity and could be useful to guide follow-up and treatment.
4:::The results of the current study suggested that NNT-AS1 might play an important role in cervical carcinogenesis and might serve as a potentially therapeutic target and prognostic marker in the treatment of cervical cancer.
4:::All MSC populations are not equivalent; care should be taken to select cells for clinical use that minimize potential safety problems and maximize chance of patient benefit. Adipose-derived MSCs seem more consistently procoagulant than BM-MSCs, presenting a potential safety concern for systemic administration in coagulopathic patients. Donor variation exists between different cell populations, and culture handling conditions may also determine coagulation activity. Cells must be routinely monitored during preparation to ensure that they retain the desired characteristics before patient administration.

4:::The Pecs block reduces postsurgical opioid consumption during the PACU stay time for patients undergoing breast surgery.
4:::There is high quality evidence that sevoflurane reduces death within 180 to 365days of surgery and, inotropic and vasoconstrictor support compared to propofol for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. There is also some evidence showing that the cardiac index is minimally influenced by administration of sevoflurane and desflurane compared to propofol.
4:::The utilization of automated anesthesia carts reduced the drug recording errors in medication administrations of anesthesia.
4:::Seasonal variation with winter predominance exists in AMI admissions and was significant in NSTEMI admissions but not in STEMI admissions. Seasonal variation was only significant in warmer southern states.

4:::In the Trivandrum Heart Failure Registry, 1 of 3 HF patients died within 1 year of follow-up during their productive life years. Suboptimal adherence to guideline-directed treatment is associated with increased propensity of readmission and death. Quality improvement programs aiming to improve adherence to guideline-based therapy and reducing readmission may result in significant survival benefits in the relatively younger cohort of HF patients in India.
4:::HCC can potentially reduce the risk of perinatal HIV transmission by improving maternal virologic control during pregnancy and postpartum and increasing postpartum contraceptive use.
4:::A decline in pVO2 between consecutive CPETs predicts increased risk for death or transplant in adults with a Fontan circulation independent of baseline pVO2. These results support the additive clinical value of serial CPET in this population.
4:::MitraClip was associated with a reduced rate of all-cause and HF hospitalizations and an increased rate of bleeding hospitalizations. One-year Medicare costs were reduced in those who survived a full year after the MitraClip procedure. Payors and providers seeking to reduce HF hospitalizations and associated Medicare costs may consider MitraClip among appropriate patients likely to survive 1 year.

4:::When ascertaining hip fractures, a definition using outpatient and provider claims identified 11% more fractures than a definition with only inpatient claims. Future studies should publish their definition of fracture and specify if diagnostic codes from contiguous fracture sites were used.
4:::Relapse is a frequent problem in PD, and long-term treatment does not protect these patients in the long run. Treatment with clonazepam predicts lower relapse when compared with paroxetine.
4:::While comparable data are scarce, our findings provide preliminary support for the prediction that mountain gorillas reach maximum body size at earlier ages compared to more frugivorous western gorillas. Data from other wild populations are needed to better understand comparative great ape development, and investigate links between trajectories of physical, behavioral, and reproductive maturation.
4:::Cognitive performance decreases during migraine, and cognitive dysfunction can be related to the duration and frequency of a migraine attack.
4:::Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation is effective at reducing important clinical outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease. While our analysis was constrained by the quality of included trials and missing information about intervention components, there appears to be little differential effect of variations in exercise intervention, particularly on mortality outcomes. Given the observed effect between higher adherence and improved outcomes, it may be more important to provide exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs which focus on achieving increased adherence to the exercise intervention.
4:::While inulin, and perhaps other fermentable fibers, can ameliorate low-grade inflammation and associated metabolic disease, it also has the potential to exacerbate disease severity in response to inducers of acute colitis.
4:::There are high rates of morbidity and mortality in South Africa, and adults living in households where family members are ill or have died are significantly more vulnerable to depression. These findings highlight the importance of providing counselling and psychiatric support not only to those directly affected by negative health events, but also to their family or household members.
4:::Lipid profile was totally different between sepsis and trauma in ICU patients: HDL levels were low in septic patients, whereas their concentration was not altered in trauma patients. This major difference reinforces the necessity to explore the therapeutic potential of HDL in sepsis.
4:::After smoking cessation, indicators of mental health improve over time, especially in the first year. The findings support the idea that smoking cessation should be a part of the management of common mood and anxiety disorders. However, due to its observational nature this study in itself cannot confirm causality, sustained abstinence may be an effect of improved mental health rather than its cause.
4:::One in three patients developed delayed post-injection pain. Flare phenomenon had no determinate effect on outcome. Patients pain response by 6 weeks is predictive of final outcome at 6 months and may help clinicians plan further treatment without delay.'
4:::Hydrodilatation results in a significant improvement of symptoms in patients with adhesive capsulitis.
4:::Ruminators fail to recruit regions with the default network (DN) that support APS. In particular, a failure to recruit the AG during APS may drive the abstract thinking style previously shown to explain depressed ruminators difficulty generating concrete solutions. Targeting this mechanism directly may reduce rumination.'
4:::Several cadaveric studies have shown superior biomechanical outcomes with LTO techniques compared to tenotomy. In the majority of studies, the strongest subscapularis repair technique in terms of biomechanical outcomes is a compression LTO. Using three or more sutures wrapped around the implant and the addition of a tension suture may increase the biomechanical strength of the LTO repair.
4:::Psychostimulants are insufficiently studied as adjunctive or monotherapy in adults with mood disorders. Most published studies have significant methodological limitations (eg, heterogeneous samples, dependent measures, type/dose of agent). In addition to improvements in methodological factors, a testable hypothesis is that psychostimulants may be more appropriately tested in select domains of psychopathology (eg, cognitive emotional processing), rather than as ""broad-spectrum"" antidepressants.
4:::Our data suggest that targeting the IP receptor with MRE-269 is a novel strategy to reduce cerebral ischemia injury and promote long-term neurological recovery in ischemic stroke.
4:::The BRAVE-ONLINE program may be useful in reducing anxiety symptoms in HFASD children, although the effects are less strong than those found in neurotypical children for a variety of reasons.
4:::FRAIL and CFS are simple frailty measures that may identify older adults at highest risk of adverse outcomes of hospitalization. FRAIL performed better in predicting in-hospital mortality.
4:::Our results suggest that an increased plasma thrombin potential is characteristic in patients with clinically stable CAD, irrespective of previous MI history and independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
4:::This preliminary research is the first to examine expectancy effects as mediators of the relationship between Native American and Caucasian race and drinking. Further understanding of the differences in positive expectancy effects between groups may have important implications for prevention and treatment of alcohol use among Native American college students.
4:::This study identified six non-technical skills that serve as the foundation for shared mental models of the patient, the current situation, and team resources. These findings contribute three important additions to the shared mental model construct: planning and preparation, risk assessment, and leadership. Shared mental models are crucial for patient safety because they enable VATS teams to anticipate problems through adaptive patterns of both implicit and explicit coordination.
4:::The results indicate the potential role of autophagy in the treatment of PM2.5-induced ocular corneal diseases and provide direct evidence for the cytotoxicity, possibly involving an autophagic process, of PM2.5 in HCECs.
4:::These findings suggested that FALEC may be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in patients with prostate cancer.
4:::Using a scenario-based learning approach with nursing and midwifery students can change attitudes and knowledge towards sustainability and climate change.

4:::Subacromial HA injections combined with physical therapy have high efficacy in the treatment of supraspinatus tendinopathy, leading to an earlier return to pre-injury activity and the need for fewer rehabilitation sessions, which may benefit both patients and the healthcare system.
4:::This ecological study provides further evidence that severe respiratory infections may trigger the onset of cardiovascular events, implicating the influenza virus as a contributing factor.
4:::Bipolar disorder is associated with increased risk of fracture, and higher cumulative dose of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics did not further increase the risk of fracture.
4:::A small increase in internal rotation, but not in adduction, was observed after arthroscopic cheilectomy and -rim trimming in cadaver hips. The hip flexion angle of the FADIR test was reproducible. dRSA kinematic analysis is a new and clinically applicable method with good potential to evaluate hip joint kinematics and to test FAI pathomechanics and other surgical corrections of the hip.
4:::Based on intra- and extra-oral evaluations with the limitation, both CR and M4M combined with a ceramic primer are indicated as promising materials to fill the access-hole. Further long-term investigation is necessary to confirm this finding.
4:::Patients supported by the Pharm Booklet were twice as likely to choose to intensify therapy. The Pharm Booklets effects are partially mediated through persuasive communication techniques that influence patients' beliefs that symptoms will improve, and increase social normative beliefs, rather than by increasing the relevant knowledge, clarifying patient values about positive or negative treatment outcomes, or increasing their self-efficacy.'
4:::Emergent status and operative procedure are the 2 highest risk factors for postoperative venous thromboembolism. Extended venous thromboembolism prophylaxis might be appropriate for patients undergoing these high-risk procedures or any emergent colorectal procedures. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A339.
4:::Bowel function deteriorates frequently after low anterior resection for rectal cancer. Severe bowel dysfunction is significantly associated with preoperative long-course radiotherapy and a lower-third tumor, and the thickening of rectal wall after radiation is a strong predictor. Treatment decisions and patient consent should be implemented with raising awareness of bowel symptom burdens. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A317.
4:::Rectal cancer surgery with or without radiation is associated with a higher risk of urinary complications requiring procedures. Patients who undergo low anterior resection without radiation tend toward the lowest risk for a urinary adverse event.
4:::Single-site laparoscopic colectomy with complete mesocolic excision for colon cancer provided acceptable perioperative outcomes and oncological outcomes, similar to those achieved with conventional multiport laparoscopic colectomy. Evidence accumulation from randomized controlled trials will be necessary to promote the wide acceptance of single-site laparoscopic colectomy. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A326.
4:::For CSM patients between 2001 and 2010, combined surgical approach increased sixfold, posterior only approach increased threefold, and ACDF doubled; laminoplasties without fusion volume remained the same. Mortality decreased whereas morbidity and total charges increased. Length of stay decreased only for ACDF approach. This study provides clinically useful data to direct future research, improving patient outcomes.
4:::Iris plasmacytoma is rare and should prompt systemic evaluation to rule out multiple myeloma. Solitary iris plasmacytoma can be successfully treated with plaque radiotherapy.
4:::We found that risk adjustment for SDH changed hospitals readmissions rate rank order. Hospital-level changes in relative readmissions performance can have considerable financial implications; thus, for pay for performance measures calculated at the hospital level, and for research associated therewith, our findings support the inclusion of SDH variables in risk adjustment.'
4:::Under the conditions of this study, the root canal configurations of an Egyptian population showed that the most common Vertucci classifications for the mesiobuccal root for maxillary first molars were type II (2-1), type IV (2-2), and type I (1). For maxillary second molars, the most common types were type II (2-1), type I (1), and type IV (2-2). Pre-evaluation of the endodontic case using cone-beam computed tomographic digital imaging provides better information of root canal morphology, which might improve the management and prognosis of the case.
4:::FE-DMEK shows efficacy similar to that of M-DMEK with apparently less graft detachment and reduced need for rebubbling.
4:::Although MTA presented higher frequency of complete sealing and greater thickness and area of newly formed mineralized tissue, Biodentine also had good histopathologic results and can be considered as an adequate furcation perforation repair material.
4:::Shorter TL was found in PCOS patients. The TA levels did not change significantly in PCOS patients. PCOS patients with a lower TA level and shorter telomeres had an earlier onset of infertility symptoms. No predictive value was found for TA and TL in terms of embryo quality or IVF outcomes in PCOS patients, and no effect OCP pretreatment was observed on either TA and TL.
4:::In our early clinical experience with the absorbable polymer matrix scaffold P4HB, it seemed to provide superior clinical performance and value-based benefit compared with porcine cadaveric biologic mesh.
4:::The most common cause of hirsutism is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In some cases, hirsutism is mild and requires only reassurance and local (nonsystemic) therapy, while in others it causes significant psychological distress and requires more extensive therapy. In case of rapid progressive hair growth should be first exclude androgen-secerning tumour (ovarian, adrenal) as the most serious condition.
4:::Cancer poses a major threat to public health and the cancer burden keep raising in China. The annual updated cancer statistics can provide scientific basis for cancer prevention and control.
4:::Although there are relationships between drug use and criminal behavior, these behaviors alone are insufficient explanations for one another in an adult reentry population. Alternatively, the compounding social and personal needs of the reentry population, and the extent to which they received support or services to address these needs, appear to have the strongest influence on both behaviors in the reentry context.
4:::A correlation exists at provider and operator level in RAMRs for PCI and cardiac surgery procedures performed in New York State. Beyond patients risk profile, that is the strongest predictor of early mortality after a cardiac procedure, hospitals and operators have a small but statistically significant contribution to variation in post-operative outcome.'
4:::Lag screws fixation of posterior wall through single ilioinguinal approach in associated both column fractures of acetabulum is a safe and effective method. Our results shown that the presence of posterior wall fracture in cases of associated both column fractures does not compromise the clinical outcomes.
4:::ORAC assessment revealed a robust effect of RFR, however the other experiments revealed equivocal effects. Further studies examining the combination of ORAC with NMDA are warranted to elucidate more clearly the effect of RFR on the brain.
4:::These data suggests that ACKR2 functions as a regulator of mechanically-induced bone remodeling by affecting the differentiation and activity of bone cells and the availability of CC chemokines at periodontal microenvironment. Therapeutic strategies based on increase of ACKR2 might be useful to hinder bone loss in inflammatory conditions.
4:::In a population with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, there were numerically fewer events of acute pancreatitis among liraglutide-treated patients (regardless of previous history of pancreatitis) compared with the placebo group. Liraglutide was associated with increases in serum lipase and amylase, which were not predictive of an event of subsequent acute pancreatitis.
4:::The presence of ANCA-associated vasculitides is rare in the eastern Metropolitan area of Mexico City. GPW was predominant over CCS, and MPA was absent. They are multi-system vasculitides with high scores of initial activity and moderate damage.
4:::The HRQoL and depression levels we found are alarming. They show the importance of evaluating objective and subjective indicators; in addition, we emphasize the need of assisting the severe cases detected and suggest the activities to face these health issues.
4:::The present study confirmed that both T and DHT accumulated in the stroma of enlarged prostates; the degree of accumulation correlated with prostate volume.
4:::Elderly patients experienced more postoperative cardiopulmonary toxicities and mortality than did younger patients after nCRT. Compared with contemporary outcomes for trimodality therapy, both cohorts had acceptable rates for adverse events and disease control. For appropriately selected elderly patients, trimodality therapy for esophageal cancer is a reasonable treatment option.
4:::In this randomized prospective trial, iNPWT did not decrease the incidence of deep infections when compared to gauze dressings in patients with acetabular fractures. Although not statistically significant, patients in the iNPWT cohort were 2.77 times more likely to develop a deep infection.
4:::For Japanese people, moderate levels of total physical activity, particularly achieved by moderate-intensity activities, may be optimal for stroke prevention because excessive vigorous-intensity activities might not be beneficial or even disadvantageous for prevention of hemorrhagic stroke.
4:::our results suggest that 2 weeks of oral taurine supplementation increases the taurine levels and has anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory effects prior to and following incremental exercise in HF patients.
4:::Indexing RV function, assessed by speckle-tracking analysis, with an estimation of pulmonary systolic arterial pressure provides a parameter of ventricular arterial coupling that is independently associated with an increased risk of mortality.
4:::This meta-analysis suggests that GLP-1 RAs therapy causes a significant reduction in CRP.
4:::A school nurse healthy relationships intervention was feasible to implement and acceptable to the students as well as the implementing nurses. While challenges arose with the initial uptake of the program, school nurses identified strategies to achieve school and student support for this intervention.
4:::The ED EMC(2) Opioid Strategy embeds a risk communication strategy into the electronic health record and promotes medication counseling with minimal workflow disruption. This trial will evaluate the strategys effectiveness and implementation fidelity as compared to usual care.'
4:::Whereas the majority of responding households did not report difficulties during this school closure, households with 1 adult losing pay during the closure reported incurring additional expenses for childcare.
4:::Our findings suggest that the peer-led comprehensive sexual health education approach embodied in Teen PEP can be an important educational mechanism for teaching students information and skills to promote sexual health.
4:::Active dissemination of environmental and policy interventions by engaging school administrators and teachers in planning and implementation shows potential for increasing physical activity in rural school settings.
4:::Ortho-Choice Ortho-Coat, and Profluorid and Enamel Pro varnishes could be utilized successfully to reduce enamel demineralization around brackets bonded to either bleached or non-bleached enamel. GC MI Paste Plus and GC Tooth Mousse were effective only in non-bleached enamel.
4:::Locally elevated perihematoma PS was found in most spontaneous basal ganglia ICH patients within 24 to 72 h after symptom onset. Perihematoma PS was higher in larger hematomas and was associated with larger edema volume. At this period, BBB leakage is likely to be an important factor in edema formation.
4:::Incidental STICs in women over age 50 are uncommon. However, the significance of lesser tubal atypias (0.3% in this study), risk of STIC in women with no epithelial pathology and the risk imposed by coexisting endometrioid neoplasia are unclear and require further study.
4:::Psychotic, mixed, and atypical features of BDs were found to be correlated with long-term treatment outcomes. Lithium and valproate showed similar efficacy but moderate/poor responders preferred to use polypharmacy.
4:::The hypothalamic injury and the high-calorie diet induce dyslipidemia and glycemic dysregulation in addition to obesity in rats. The usual therapeutic dose of exenatide in humans is antidiabetogenic in both these obesity models, but is anti-obesogenic and hypolipidemic only in diet-induced obesity. Agonists of GLP-1R are promising anti-obesogenic and antidyslipidemic drugs in the early stages of the obesity, in which the integrity of the nervous system was unaffected.
4:::The quality of early caregiving experience mediated the association between both interventions and height-for-age. The effect of maternal depressive symptoms on growth was mediated by diarrhoeal illness. Programmatic approaches to child nutrition and growth must address all these potentially modifiable factors.
4:::Interventions, especially in the control group, are poorly described in the clinical trials published in leading physical therapy journals. A complete description of the intervention in a published report is crucial for physical therapists to be able to use the intervention in clinical practice.
4:::Baseline evaluation of NH quality shows remarkable variability among facilities and ample room for improvement.
4:::Infliximab drug levels are associated with the depth of response/remission in patients with Crohns disease, but no such relationship was observed for adalimumab. More data are needed to explain the variation in drug levels.'
4:::Several modifiable lifestyle factors were associated with male osteoporosis. Current smokers at any age and underweight men below age 50 were more likely to have osteoporosis, whereas men who were overweight, obese, or had a regular exercise habit were more likely to have normal bone status, regardless of age.
4:::The undergraduate syllabus must be revised to include sufficient content and training to allow the student to indicate implant-based treatments based on evidence. Students would prefer training to be included in the undergraduate syllabus.
4:::The patient interval is the main component of the pathway to treatment since the detection of a bodily change until the definitive diagnosis. Therefore, strategies focused on risk groups to shorten this interval should be implemented in order to ease an early diagnosis of symptomatic oral cancer.
4:::Youth with PHIV demonstrated stable memory and EF during a 2-year period of adolescence, allowing cautious optimism regarding long-term outcomes.
4:::HD patients in Slovenia have compromised oral health and increased serum inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers. Edentulousness was an independent predictor for the increased CRP, indicating a need for improved dental care to retain the teeth as long as possible.
4:::In conclusion, both BD1 and BD2 had bimodal AAO distributions, but EO subgroups had a diagnostic-specific clinical delineation.
4:::Port-A-Caths that are retained after attempted removal is a complication encountered predominantly in catheters that have been in use for a prolonged duration. Furthermore, factor replacement therapy in haemophiliacs may be a risk factor for this complication.
4:::Our routine HNC IMRT QA program resulted in the implementation of a significant number of major changes. The high compliance with the program is indicative of the belief in its clinical value. This study can inform discussion on optimal RT QA processes in routine clinical practice.
4:::The longitudinal data are suggestive of a trend towards earlier fusion of the SOS in patients with Crouzon syndrome and OSA as compared to patients with Crouzon syndrome without OSA. Although the SNA increases with age, our results suggest that this increase in independent closure of the SOS.
4:::Paramedic infusion initiation using gravity-controlled tubing permits rapid achievement of target serum levels of potential neuroprotective agents. The absence of association of clinical outcomes with achieved magnesium levels provides further evidence that magnesium is not biologically neuroprotective in acute stroke.
4:::Integrated VSRs and traditional VSFs graduate with comparable overall vascular surgery clinical experience. VSRs reported, on average, a significantly higher number of major vascular procedures during their tenure as trainees as well as a significantly increased number of cases in six of the other ACGME categories.
4:::LILS was a potential method for the treatment of vaginal vault prolapse. The technique could be performed easily and might be an alternative to other POP surgeries. However, further studies were required to focus on its long-term efficacy.
4:::PedsSNM frequently presented as Grade IV tumors. The nasal cavity was the most common primary site and rhabdomyosarcoma was the most frequent histology. Patients receiving surgery alone had the highest survival; however, this may be a reflection of smaller, less aggressive tumors preferentially being treated with surgery alone.
4:::The youngest generation favored the largest signal to noise ratio (radio level above background noise), a preference which waned with increasing background noise.
4:::Our study indicates that swimming in a chlorinated pool induces perturbations of the immune response through acute alterations of patterns of cytokine and chemokine secretion. The observed effects could not be uniquely attributed to either exposure to DBPs or physical activity. Evidence in the literature suggests that observed decreases in immune markers are possibly due to an immunosuppressive effect of DBPs, while the increase in IL-1RA might be due to physical activity.
4:::In this hospital-based NHS program, the screening rate plateaued at ∼50% when the National Health Authority was not involved, but increased to ∼70% when the cost for low-income families was covered by the government. Among infants needing active hearing rehabilitation due to bilateral moderate to profound SNHL, 15% were lost to follow-up. These results demonstrate the need for a universal, mandatory NHS program to systematically register hearing-impaired infants within the government-sponsored public healthcare system.

4:::The decrease in quantifiable metrics of plan revisions and incident reports suggests automatic RT plan-checking software enhances patient safety and clinical efficiency. Although only modest time savings may be gained using Verifier for the QCR itself, the greater impact on efficiency is through avoiding late-stage plan modifications and improving documentation via automation. We encourage other institutions to consider working toward adding similar technologies to enhance their RT quality assurance programs.
4:::The present study demonstrates that grafting NSCs modified by noggin gene provides better neuroprotection for cerebrovascular disease.
4:::We validated that a combination of mean lung dose, pre IL-8 level, and TGF-β1 2w/pre ratio provided a more accurate model to predict the risk of RILT2 compared with MLD alone.
4:::PD patients with ICB have abnormal performance on a psychophysical task assessing sense of agency, which might be related to a deficit in action representation at cognitive/experiential level. Yet, they have no deficit on tasks evaluating externally and internally triggered inhibitory control, or in reward-based decision-making. We conclude that impaired sense of agency may be a factor contributing to ICB in PD patients.
4:::This prospective study suggests a potential benefit of hippocampal sparing in limiting the neuropsychological sequelae of brain radiation, but with a risk of failures in the spared region. These data strongly support continued enrollment on ongoing cooperative group randomized trials. Clinical Trials registration number: NCT01797159.

4:::Herein we report acceptable tolerability and preliminary efficacy of DM/Q up to 45/10mg administered every 12h in patients with TRD. Future larger placebo controlled randomized trials in this population are warranted.
4:::The application of LA strain is specific to the component measured. LA pump strain is independent of LV mechanics.
4:::Our findings support the suggestion that TCTEX1D2 mutations have variable expressivity and may be associated with disturbances of embryonic development caused by both, ciliary signaling and motile dysfunction. The presence of molar-incisor-malformation in the living patient raises the possibility of a pathogenetic link of this rare dental anomaly to ciliary dysfunction during tooth development at least in some individuals.
4:::The RCADS is a reliable instrument for cross-cultural use, with the advantage of providing more information with a low number of items in the assessment of both anxiety and depression symptoms in children and adolescents.
4:::The use of PET/MR is clinically feasible in pediatric patients with a histiocytic disease. PET/MR demonstrates comparable image quality and lesion detection to PET/CT while maintaining strongly correlated quantitative performance. Given the significant radiation dose savings, PET/MR represents an appealing alternative to PET/CT in the care of children with histiocytic disorders.
4:::Exposing critically ill patients to high workload/staffing ratios is associated with a substantial reduction in the odds of survival.
4:::This cross-sectional study demonstrates a broad heterogeneity of care giving between the clinical national and international guidelines and the actual practice in Spain. Although most of the responders refer to base their endometrial cancer management on Spanish and European Society of Gynaecologic Oncology guidelines (64.1%), many discrepancies have been observed, mainly in the management of intermediate-risk cases and follow-up. It may be caused by the lack of consensus on certain points, lack of facilities in lower case load centers, and also due to disagreement or unawareness on the current knowledge.
4:::Low-volume disease was present in one third of patients with nodal metastases, the largest metastatic deposit only in patients who had SLN dissection; these patients were significantly more likely to have grade 1 endometrioid carcinoma with less than 50% myometrial invasion, traditional ""low-risk"" features.
4:::More research is needed to understand the behavioral aspects of gender difference in CRN. Patient-centered healthcare needs to take gender difference into account when addressing cost-related non-adherence behavior.

4:::These findings show progress in ARV treatment, although ARV coverage remains low compared with other populations at risk for HIV. Efforts to improve ARV coverage among PWIDs are needed.
4:::Although syphilis screening among MSM increased during 2008-2014, less than half of MSM reported recent syphilis screening in 2014. Given continued increases in syphilis among MSM, innovative interventions are needed to improve compliance with screening recommendations.
4:::Cortisol after 1 mg-DST is independently associated with the CVE occurrence. The ANNs might help for assessing the CVE risk in AI patients.
4:::This trend analysis suggests declining HIV prevalence among NYC PWID. However, HCV seroprevalence was high and risk behaviors were considerable. Longitudinal surveillance of HIV and HCV risk behaviors and infections is needed to monitor trends and for ongoing data-informed prevention among PWID.
4:::The results of this study demonstrated a relationship in performance of different single leg hop tests in professional decathletes. Adversely there is no correlation of the single leg hop tests and the performance in the star excursion balance test. To minimize the time effort of testing procedures, to avoid redundant testing and to determine overall postural control in decathletes, test-batteries should include the SEBT and at least one SLHT.
4:::Both IU to meet men and meeting the last partner online increased since 2008. Although men who used the internet more frequently reported more partners in the past 12 months, they were also more likely to report testing in the past 12 months and were more likely to be HIV-positive aware.
4:::Addressing HIV in cities with high levels of MSMW may have the dual effect of improving the health of MSM populations that have a high burden of HIV and to improve the health of their larger communities.
4:::Our findings suggest that the NEUROD2 gene could play a role in the pathophysiology of neurocognitive dysfunctions as well as in the change of cognitive symptoms under antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.
4:::The grooved stent provides a potential percutaneous means to deliver sufficient numbers of viable and functional cells to a vessel segment during vascular intervention.

Posterosuperior part of nasal cavity moved minimally in lateral direction and width of nasal cavity at the floor of the nose increased, there was downward and forward movement of maxilla with a tendency toward posterior rotation. Maximum von Mises stresses were found along midpalatal, pterygomaxillary, nasomaxillary and frontomaxillary sutures.
4:::The studied elderly population showed evidence of similar long-term clinical efficacy after definitive CCRT when compared with cohorts of younger patients with similar prognostic status. An increased rate of pulmonary toxicity was identified, without evidence of differences for nonpulmonary severe adverse events. Understanding the prognostic risk factors of pulmonary toxicity after CCRT may effectuate improved long-term outcomes for elderly population.
4:::The use of adjuvant CRT is increasing among elderly patients with resected squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck exhibiting ECE or positive margins. Chemoradiotherapy was associated with an improvement in OS on multivariable analysis but not propensity-weighted analysis. Among fit elderly patients with ECE or positive margins after definitive surgical resection, concurrent chemotherapy can be carefully considered.
4:::Taken together with results from the in vivo study indicated that implantation of hyaluronan thiomer as a combination of gel and matrix might enhance articular cartilage regeneration in an empty defect. Despite their benefits, the intrinsic healing capacity of New Zealand rabbits is a limitation for comparative test subject in pre-clinical models of cartilage defects.

4:::Irregular shape may identify the ruptured sIA better than size in patients presenting with aSAH and multiple sIAs.
4:::Few interventions have been tested for IBD abdominal pain. The limited evidence suggests that relaxation and changing cognitions are promising, possibly with individualised dietary changes. There is a need to develop interventions for abdominal pain management in IBD.
4:::Results indicate feasibility for larger, more definitive study. Both groups had significant reductions in alcohol consumption over time and high-treatment engagement rates. Both oral and injectable formulations are feasible to initiate prior to discharge for hospital inpatients identified as having an AUD.
4:::REEc1 can be considered the best accurate model of REE estimation in Brazilian young men, providing the REE and metabolically active tissue-organ of four components. Caution should be exercised with the use of DXA metabolic maps in populations with greater weight and greater weight-height.
4:::These findings illustrate differences between dual-condom LARC and LARC-only college users. It is likely that relationship status and number of partners influences perceived risk for STIs and decision making for dual use among this population.
4:::Estimated gonorrhea rate among MSM increased in a network of 6 geographically diverse US jurisdictions. Estimating the size of this population, determining MSM among reported cases and estimating rates are essential first steps for better understanding the changing epidemiology of gonorrhea.
4:::Rectal STI are independently associated with HIV acquisition. These findings support the hypothesis that rectal STI play a biologically mediated causal role in HIV acquisition and support screening/treatment of STI for HIV prevention.
4:::The rate of periocular allergic reactions to NPD ophthalmic ointment is significantly lower than reported in the literature for other topical preparations of neomycin and polymyxin B. The low rate of allergy in this study suggests that NPD ophthalmic ointment can safely be applied to the periocular skin with a very minimal risk of inciting an allergic reaction.
4:::RBC transfusion is commonly used in the early resuscitation of septic patients with hematological malignancies. Although it was preferentially provided to the most severe patients, we found it possibly associated with an increased risk of death.
4:::Haptoglobin β protein offers a novel therapeutic approach to fight against various inflammatory diseases caused by excessive HMGB1 release.
4:::Proportional ventilation during exercise results in higher work efficiency and less increase in VO2 compared to ventilation with PSV. These preliminary findings suggest that proportional ventilation could enhance the training effect and facilitate rehabilitation.
4:::Although few ESBL-PE carriers developed ESBL-PE pneumonia overall, a high proportion of pneumonia were caused by ESBL-PE in carriers developing ICUAP. ESBL-PE pneumonia was not an independent predictor of mortality. As pneumonia caused by CRB is increasing, knowledge of factors associated with ESBL-PE or CRB pneumonia may help empiric therapy of pneumonia among ESBL-PE carriers.
4:::Defining the precise risk of LNM could lead to proper selection of patients in whom any lymph nodal procedure, including SLN, could be avoided.
4:::Our study found that geriatric care was not superior to orthopedic directed management in the treatment of elderly patients with hip fractures in terms of in-hospital complications, and hospitalization times.
4:::These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which MBP directly acts on ghrelin secretion. Additionally, the elevated ghrelin level induced by MBP may act as a mediator for bone formation.
4:::Complications of distal phalanx fractures in children are frequent. The incidence varies by fracture type, the highest of which are for Salter-Harris IV, Seymour, and mallet fractures. Special care needs to be taken to reduce the complication rates of these common fractures.

4:::We have demonstrated that the endoscopic surgery is safe and effective for repairing CDH. The endoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure with fast post-operative recovery and a good cosmetic outcome.
4:::Our experience confirms the feasibility and safety of LESS in a variety of benign adnexal pathology. Both the SIMP and HMGP approaches seem comparable. Performing LESS without the use of specialised access ports or instruments makes it cost effective and suitable for wider application.
4:::Compatibility is a key characteristic of multi-herb prescriptions. It often results in the change of the therapeutic material basis and, thus, produces the effect of reducing toxicity and/or increasing curative efficacy.
4:::There is noticeable public interest in learning Hands-Only CPR by using an airport kiosk and an airport is an opportune place to engage a layperson in learning Hands-Only CPR. The average quality of Hands-Only CPR by the public needs improvement and adding kiosks to other locations in the airport could reach more people and could be replicated in other major airports in the United States.
4:::The results of the present study suggested that SSB intake is associated with obesity and that coffee/tea, water, and milk may be good alternatives for SSB. Further longitudinal and intervention studies are warranted to examine the effects of beverage substitution on obesity.
4:::Bariatric Surgery is the most effective treatment for weight loss and metabolic improvement. However, in our study, surgery did not achieve the expected outcome in patients with specific metabolic, anthropometric and surgical characteristics (BMI>50 kg/m2, presence of metabolic syndrome, presence of T2DM with high preoperative HbA1c% level and gastric pouch volume greater than 60 mL).
4:::ω-3 PUFAs may have a therapeutic role in decreasing pain associated with RA, with doses of 3 to 6 g/d appearing to have a greater effect. Due to the limitations identified in the RCTs included in this review, more research is needed to investigate ω-3 PUFAs in larger populations and over extended periods of time.
4:::Cigarette smoking may be associated with serous OvCa among AA, which differs from associations reported among Caucasians. Exposure misclassification or reverse causality may partially explain the absence of increased risk among current smokers and lack of dose-response associations. Better characterization of smoking patterns is needed in this understudied population.
4:::Quantitative ER status is inversely associated with tumor response in BC patients treated with NCT. A cut-off of 60 and 80% predicts best the association with tumor size reduction and pCR, respectively. Therefore, patients with an ER status higher than the cut-off might benefit from a neoadjuvant endocrine therapy approach. Patients with pCR had better survival outcomes independently of their tumor phenotype. Further prospective studies are needed to validate the clinical utility of quantitative ER as a predictive marker of tumor response.
4:::Pre-operative simulation, changes in ports for insertion of the scope and robotic first arm, continuation of the coaxial operation, and use of a powered stapler made Delta applicable for RADG. Delta can be considered as a useful reconstruction method.
4:::Although the risk for AKI was lower than for patients treated with TVR/BOC-based regimens, AKI was seen during 11% of SOF-based regimens and was mostly reversible. Patients with ascites and patients using NSAIDs have an increased risk for AKI during SOF-based antiviral therapy.
4:::Persons experiencing epilepsy should be educated on the proper use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs); moreover, their preferences should be considered when types of therapy are prescribed. Patients who deviate from recommended use of medication should report these practices to medical personnel so that potential changes in health status can be addressed properly.
4:::Community therapist reports suggest that most adaptations undertaken involve engaging with the practice to augment the fit of the EBPs for local contexts; however, when practices were perceived negatively, therapists were more likely to make adaptations reducing or rearranging components. (PsycINFO Database Record
4:::This study demonstrated that similar to subjects with DM, subjects with IFG also have IOP levels that are higher than those with normal serum glucose. Moreover, there is a direct correlation between fasting serum glucose levels and changes in IOP. These findings highlight another end-organ effect of uncontrolled glucose levels.
4:::In this prospective observational study, we found no differences in the incidence of pneumonia and/or ARDS between patients undergoing lung resection with tidal volumes <8 or ≥8 mL/kg. Our data suggest that when fluid restriction and peak airway pressures are limited, the clinical impact of PLV in this patient population is small. Future randomized trials are needed to better understand the benefits of a small tidal volume strategy during OLV on clinically important outcomes.
4:::The different cardiovascular effects of the isometheptene enantiomers are probably due to differences in their mechanism of action, namely: (i) a mixed sympathomimetic action for (S)-isometheptene (a tyramine-like action and a direct stimulation of α1-adrenoceptors); and (ii) exclusively a tyramine like action for (R)-isometheptene. Thus, (R)-isometheptene may represent a superior therapeutic benefit as an antimigraine agent.
4:::This represents the longest prospective trial of a medical therapy for Cushings disease to date. A subset of patients treated with pasireotide maintained biochemical and clinical improvements for 5 years, with no new safety signals emerging. These data support the use of pasireotide as an effective long-term therapy for some patients with Cushing's disease.'
4:::This regimen was feasible and highly active resulting in encouraging survival in patients with LAPC. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the effectiveness of this treatment strategy in future studies. Clinical trials information: UMIN000006332.
4:::MSFA with BC resulted in adequate amounts of new bone formation allowing successful implant installation; adding EMD did not have a significant effect.
4:::The present results suggest that oleandrin induces apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells via the mitochondrial pathway. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism of anti-cancer property of oleandrin.
4:::In middle-aged men, it is important to include metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma in the differential diagnosis of cavernous sinus syndrome, even in the absence of primary tumor diagnosis.
4:::In this Canadian cohort of patients with cryptogenic IS or TIA, the prevalence of Fabry was 0.3% if p.R118C variant is considered as pathogenic. This suggests that more cost-effective methods should be applied for diagnosis of Fabry rather than systematic genetic screening in this population. Overall, cryptogenic IS in young adults is associated with favorable outcomes.
4:::Adjuvant radiation is indicated for advanced stage tumors or early stage tumors with adverse features. For early stage tumors without adverse features, there was no survival benefit from radiation therapy. Adjuvant radiation should be decided on a case-by-case basis for these patients.
4:::There is an emerging trend towards following similar practices for the management of low-grade gliomas in Europe. Our results are descriptive and formalise current discussions in our group. Also, they contribute towards the development of a European assessment protocol.
4:::Our study suggests that among patients with ICH, previous use of CAPT, but not SAPT, was associated with higher risk for in-hospital mortality.
4:::The thermodynamic properties of the Gd2 O3 -Y2 O3 -HfO2 system, i.e., the component activities in the samples and the excess Gibbs energy, obtained in the present study at 2500 K, exhibited negative deviations from ideal behavior. The concentration dependence of excess Gibbs energy of the Gd2 O3 -Y2 O3 -HfO2 system was approximated with an empirical equation. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
4:::Independent of other risk factors, higher vegetable nitrate was associated with a lower CCA-IMT and a lower risk of an ischemic cerebrovascular disease event.
4:::Tranexamic acid inhibits NMDA receptors likely by reducing the binding of the co-agonist glycine and also inhibits α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid and kainate receptors. Receptor blockade occurs at high millimolar concentrations of tranexamic acid, similar to the concentrations that occur after topical application to peripheral tissues. Glutamate receptors in tissues including bone, heart, and nerves play various physiologic roles, and tranexamic acid inhibition of these receptors may contribute to adverse drug effects.
4:::We found supporting evidence for two out of three hypothesized resilience indicators to be related to frailty levels in older adults. By mirroring the dynamical resilience indicators to a frailty index, we delivered a first empirical base to validate and quantify the construct of systemic resilience in older adults in a dynamic way.
4:::Routine childhood vaccination is an important public health tool to reduce infectious diseases. The present study provides important epidemiological evidence significantly associating increasing Hg exposure from Thimerosal-containing childhood vaccines and the subsequent risk of atypical autism diagnosis, and suggests that Thimerosal should be eliminated from vaccines.
4:::Extending the focus of care and research to improving the capacity to respond to stressors could benefit older adults in promoting a healthier life span.
4:::Our results show equal fluctuation of LEV serum concentrations with branded LEV and the generic LEV. Most importantly, within-subject variability was much larger than the small, non-significant differences between brands.
4:::Aptima demonstrated excellent precision, linearity, and accuracy in all genotypes tested. Good concordance was observed between Aptima and RealTime assays in clinical samples. The performance of the Aptima assay, on the fully automated Panther platform, makes it an excellent candidate for the detection and monitoring of HCV RNA in plasma and serum samples.
4:::Our review of 624 patients is the largest study in this subject and the results demonstrate that wearing a cervical collar following PRM for BPPV concedes no significant benefit. Excluding this from postprocedure guidance allows patients to manage without the inconvenience of wearing a cervical collar, and allows departments to update clinical guidance.
4:::We observed wide variation in the diagnosis of FEA among U.S. pathologists. This suggests that perceptions of diagnostic criteria and any implied risk associated with FEA may also vary. Surgical excision following a core biopsy diagnosis of FEA should be reconsidered and studied further.
4:::Nurse-led vascular care in hypertensive community-dwelling older persons did not diminish WMH accumulation over 3 years. However, our results do suggest this type of intervention could be effective in persons with high WMH volumes. There was no effect on lacunar infarcts incidence but numbers were low.
4:::The VERIS HIV-1 Assay for use on the DxN VERIS System demonstrated comparable clinical performance to COBAS(®) HIV-1 Test, RealTime HIV-1 Assay, and VERSANT HIV-1 Assay.
4:::Scanning of pregnant women for both depression and childhood trauma will give change to health providers to support this vulnerable group and their prospective children.
4:::We found that intervention was more common in the later time period, with good results concerning safety, and less readmissions. A majority of the conservatively treated patients had surgical intervention within two years after delivery. Our results support surgical intervention in pregnancy.
4:::Despite higher costs in year zero, annual costs thereafter were lowest in the two-stent treatment arm. Two-stent treatment may reduce OAG-related health resource use, leading to direct savings, especially over medications only or at longer time horizons.
4:::Our findings suggest that long-term maintenance of PA increases resulting from group meetings in an active intervention occur when followed by a maintenance intervention.
4:::Abnormal UES function was noted in one-third of patients with LPR or GERD. However, there were no abnormalities on esophageal function testing specific for LPR.
4:::Findings may assist mental health professionals in enhancing health-promoting behaviors and reduce the psychological distress of community residents to improve well-being.
4:::False-negative/weakly-reactive HIV rapid tests and false-recent HIV incidence assay results were observed in virally-suppressed individuals, regardless of pre-ART CD4 cell count. Downregulation of the antibody response to HIV infection in the setting of ART may impact population-level surveys of HIV prevalence and incidence.
4:::Our findings add valuable insights into the patterns of sedentary behaviors among older adults. Concentrated research efforts should be made to gain a clearer understanding of patterns and enablers to sedentary behaviors, which will allow for development of targeted interventions for this high-risk population.
4:::Use of this in-line digestive cartridge was safe and well tolerated, and resulted in significantly increased levels of plasma omega-3 FA used with enteral formula, suggesting an overall increased fat absorption.
4:::This result was unexpected and suggests that further research needs to be conducted with a more robust sample size to account for any moderating influences that might explain why a hopeful message that communicates togetherness would have a negative attitudinal impact on male viewers.
4:::Patients with bipolar disorder show degenerative changes detected by OCT in relation to healthy controls.
4:::The use of the Dutch painDETECT and the DN4 in patients with suspected radiculopathy should not be recommended yet. A combination of both screening tools seems most suitable to rule out neuropathic pain in patients suspected of radiculopathy.
4:::Various types of social interventions can be effective in reducing adult depression. Social interventions can be tailored to diverse groups, are feasible in resource-scarce communities, and have the potential to reduce population-level depression due to their group formats.
4:::The study adds to the understanding of what may exacerbate schizotypal symptoms in the first 12 months postpartum as parental attachment insecurity and parental stress together predicted elevated self-reported experiences of schizotypal symptoms.
4:::Our findings indicate that although the MDQ items cohere to define a total score, their structure is best modeled by meaningful Positive Activation and Negative Activation factors. Researchers and clinicians should be aware of these distinct sets of MDQ content, as high scorers on Positive Activation are less likely to identify past symptoms as problematic and show distinct clinical profiles from high scorers on Negative Activation.
4:::having a positive mindset and a balanced perspective on the pregnancy and bodily changes are important factors in being able to work throughout pregnancy. Support, in various arenas, might positively influence pregnant women´s positive mindset, having a favourable effect on their health resources and ability to continue working when bearing children.
4:::Baseline and postoperative CRP levels predict immediate and long-term mortality in all stages of operable lung cancer. Patients with higher CRP levels could be candidate to randomised adjuvant trials with anti-inflammatory agents.
4:::This study showed that stromal ERα and PRB expressions are independent prognostic indicators of cervical squamous cell carcinoma.
4:::Familiarity with and use of data sharing projects was high among GPs and PMs. Both their individual and organisational characteristics were associated with the reported frequency of discussions and patients responses. Improved awareness of the impact of provider characteristics and attitudes on patients' decisions about data sharing may enhance the equity and autonomy of those decisions.'
4:::Our results indicate that GAS5 is a direct target of miR-21 and can predict the clinical staging of cervical cancer. Most importantly, GAS5 can also influence cisplatin resistance in cervical cancer via regulating the phosphorylation of Akt. All of these suggest that GAS5 may be a novel therapeutic target for treating cervical cancer.
4:::COMT Val158Met polymorphism may be associated with mammographic density at least in healthy women. Menopausal status and HRT should be taken into account in future studies to avoid masking of the underlying effects.
4:::Our findings are highly supportive of the practice of analyzing the impact of clinical decision support on performance metrics. This was the most common user-centered design practice in our study, and was the practice associated with higher perceived utility of clinical decision support. This practice may be particularly helpful at community-based clinics, which are typically less connected to VA medical center resources.
4:::SYD985 is a novel ADC with remarkable activity against EOC with strong (3+) as well as moderate to low (i.e., 2+ and 1+) HER2/neu expression. SYD985 is more potent than T-DM1 in comparative experiments and unlike T-DM1, it is active against EOC demonstrating moderate/low or heterogeneous HER2/neu expression.
4:::This early warning tool can be used as an indicator for other communicable diseases in order to apply effective and timely public health measures especially in the setting of weak surveillance systems.
4:::This report illustrates that while toe morphology remains the earliest indicator of FOP, toe morphology alone is not an unequivocal clinical diagnostic feature of FOP, and supports that embryonic development of the great toe is highly sensitive to dysregulated signaling from at least two BMP type I receptors.
4:::Oral HPV DNA is uncommon in young women in Latin America, and often appears to clear within a few years at similar rates to cervical HPV.
4:::Our case of an erythematous maculopapular rash during lithium treatment was the first to present a challenge-de-challenge-re-challenge sequence that suggests causality. Although meta-analysis does not point to an increased rate of adverse skin reaction during lithium treatment, clinicians should not neglect to monitor cutaneous symptoms during lithium treatment.
