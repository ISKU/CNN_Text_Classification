The seasonal or monthly variation in symptom score differences was analyzed through generalized estimating equation analysis.'
2::Demographic, procedural, and outcome data of all patients with EVLA of the great, accessory, or small saphenous vein and EHIT prophylaxis with 10 mg/d rivaroxaban between 2012 and 2014 were reviewed and analyzed in this investigator-initiated multicenter retrospective observational single-arm study.
2::Professionals in Quebec, Canada, working in childcare fields such as education, social services, health, community services and management answered a self-report questionnaire between 2013 and 2015. The 296 respondents (90% female) had a mean age of 39 (20-65), were from urban, semi-urban and rural settings and provided services to families with children up to five years of age.
2::This was a cross-sectional survey of contraceptive use among 2390 currently married women across 25 townships in Myanmar in 2014. Social franchise program measures were from programmatic records.
2::We did a cluster-randomised trial in Rusizi district, western Rwanda. We defined villages as clusters. We assessed villages for eligibility then randomly selected 150 for the study using a simple random sampling routine in Stata. We stratified villages by wealth index and by the proportion of children younger than 2 years with caregiver-reported diarrhoea within the past 7 days. We randomly allocated these villages to three study groups: no intervention (control; n=50), eight community health club sessions (Lite intervention; n=50), or 20 community health club sessions (Classic intervention; n=50). Households in these villages were enrolled in 2013 for a baseline survey, then re-enrolled in 2015 for an endline survey. The primary outcome was caregiver-reported diarrhoea within the previous 7 days in children younger than 5 years. Analysis was by intention to treat and per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01836731.
2::Hippocampal astrocytes and neurons isolated from neonatal Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to propofol at a clinically relevant dose of 30 μM or dimethyl sulfoxide as control for 6 hours. Propofol-induced cell death was determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining in astrocyte-alone cultures, neuron-alone cultures, or cocultures containing either low or high density of astrocytes (1:9 or 1:1 ratio of astrocytes to neurons ratio [ANR], respectively). The astrocyte-conditioned medium was collected 12 hours after propofol exposure and measured by protein array assay. BDNF concentration in astrocyte-conditioned medium was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Neuron-alone cultures were treated with BDNF, tyrosine receptor kinase B inhibitor cyclotraxin-B, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) inhibitor CHIR99021, or mitochondrial fission inhibitor Mdivi-1 before propofol exposure. Western blot was performed for quantification of the level of protein kinase B and GSK3β. Mitochondrial shape was visualized through translocase of the outer membrane 20 staining.
2::This was a population-based matched case-control and case-crossover study based on secondary data linked together from Swedish national registers. Cases were drivers aged 50-80 years involved in a vehicle crash resulting in injuries between January 2006 and December 2009 for the case-control study (n = 27,096) and from February 2006 to December 2009 for the case-crossover study (n = 26,586). For the first design, four controls were matched to each case by sex, age, and residential area, and exposure was categorized into new, occasional, and frequent use of zolpidem only, zopiclone only, and combined zolpidem and zopiclone. For the case-crossover study, newly dispensed zolpidem or zopiclone users were assessed during the 28 days prior to the crash and compared with an equally long control period using a 12-week washout period. Matched adjusted odds ratios (OR) were computed using conditional logistic regression.
2::This single-center, retrospective study was performed from October 2009 through September 2015 in patients with ILD who were ≥18 years old and had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, ILD related to collagen tissue disease, or combined pulmonary fibrosis/emphysema. The primary outcome measure was AE development within three months from each D-dimer measurement. The secondary outcome measures were respiratory-related hospitalization, all-cause hospitalization, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and all-cause mortality within three months.
2::A female proband, her brother, and her mother underwent complete ophthalmologic examinations that included optical coherence tomography and visual field assessments using a Humphrey Field Analyzer with both standard automated perimetry (SAP) and short-wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP). Genomic DNA from each patient was examined to detect genomic rearrangements involving OPA1; the genetic analysis involved both multiplex ligation probe amplification and conventional Sanger sequencing.
2::A retrospective record review of trauma cases admitted to the PICU at CHBAH from 2011 to 2013 was performed.
2::The data used in this study were derived from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The analysis included 2967 postmenopausal women under 70 years of age, and there were no missing data. Questionnaire responses regarding MHT, current life habits, reproductive history, and rhinitis were reviewed. The levels of total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific IgE for Dermatophagoides farinae, cockroaches, and dogs were measured, using approximately 10% of all samples. We compared women who were users of MHT and non-users of MHT. We also compared women with and without chronic rhinitis.
2::Data were collected on Scottish 11-, 13-, and 15-year-olds by the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study between 1990 and 2014 (n = 42,312). Logistic regression was used to examine changes in the prevalence of over- and underweight perceptions. Ordinal and linear regressions were used to examine changes in the association between body perception and mental well-being.
2::A total of 48 patients with COPD and 48 matched controlled subjects completed measures of anxiety sensitivity, agoraphobic avoidance, anxiety and depression. Objective COPD severity was measured using forced expiratory volume in the first second.
2::Patients who underwent arthroscopic arthrolysis of the elbow between 2010 and 2015 were included in this study. Forty-two patients with an average age of 41.0 ± 13.5 years were available for evaluation. The mean follow-up was 28.3 ± 14.9 months. With regard to aetiology of elbow contractures, patients were divided into post-traumatic (group A) and degenerative (group B) cohort. General patients data, previous surgical treatment and ROM were recorded. At follow-up evaluation, the clinical outcome was assessed by the ROM, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain assessment and the Elbow Self-Assessment Score (ESAS).'
2::Retrospective analysis over a 6-year period (2010-2015) in Piedmont and Aosta Valley regions (5,305,940 inhabitants, 141,174 diabetics treated with metformin) of all MALA-RRT cases.
2::Symptomatic patients undergoing evaluation for suspected choledocolithiasis from January 2008 to February 2011 were reviewed. In the cohort without choledocolithiasis, the relationship between aging and CBD size was examined as a continuous variable and by comparing mean CBD size across stratified age groups. Multivariate analysis examined the relationship between increasing age and diagnostic probability of choledocolithiasis in all patients.
2::The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit were used to assess arousal level and delirium prospectively in all patients with severe aortic stenosis who had transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement at an academic medical center. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between procedure type and occurrence of delirium. Cox regression was used to assess the association between postoperative delirium and 6-month mortality.
2::A 1-time survey of 268 care providers in 10 intensive care units across the country who had worked at least 4 shifts per month to examine their attitudes toward workload burden, difficulty carrying out the bundle, perceived safety, confidence, and perceived strength of evidence. Logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship of unit-level provider attitudes with ABCDE bundle adherence in 101 patients, adjusted for patients age, severity of illness, and comorbidity.'
2::The study sample consisted of five male and 11 female patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic colorectal surgery; patients were between 41 and 77 years of age. Venous whole blood (8 - 10 mL) was collected from patients prior to colorectal surgery, as well as on postoperative day 1 and 2. Arginine, citrulline, ADMA, and symmetric dimethylarginine levels were measured in collected blood using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.
2::Wrist and ankle actigraphy data were collected for 48 hours in consenting MICU patients. Actigraphy-based measures of estimated sleep and activity were summarized by using descriptive statistics. Agreement between wrist and ankle measurements was evaluated using Cohen κ statistics (for sleep quantity) and intraclass correlation coefficients (for activity).
2::A cross-sectional study using registered nurse survey data from 2006 to 2008 was conducted. Data from 2187 NICU, PICU, and general pediatric nurses in 223 hospitals in 4 US states were analyzed. For 12 nursing activities, nurses reported about necessary activities that were not done on their last shift because of time constraints. Nurses reported their patient assignment and rated their work environment.
2::Between January 2012 and September 2013, we consecutively enrolled children aged 2-59 months with primary respiratory complaints at the outpatient clinics, emergency department, and inpatient wards of the Instituto Nacional de Salud del Niño in Lima, Peru. All participants underwent clinical evaluation by a pediatrician and lung ultrasonography by one of three general practitioners. We also consecutively enrolled children without respiratory symptoms. Children with respiratory symptoms had a chest radiograph. We obtained ancillary laboratory testing in a subset.
2::We included employees (N = 8968) who participated in the Danish Work Environment Cohort Study (DWECS), based on a representative sample of the Danish working population. Three dichotomous independent variables were created: MJH in general, combination MJH (i.e. second job as employee) and hybrid MJH (i.e. self-employed in second job). LTSA (≥5 weeks) was measured using the Danish Register for Evaluation of Marginalization during 78 weeks of follow-up. Potential confounders included demographics, health, and work characteristics. Logistic regression analyses were performed to study whether LTSA was associated with MJH in general, combination MJH, and hybrid MJH. Interaction effects for gender, age, total working hours per week (≤37 or >37 h a week), and shift work were tested.
2::The expression of MMP-2 and -9 in the cornea after suture inplacement, treated with SB-3CT or negative control, was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Inflammatory corneal neovascularization (NV) was induced by corneal suture placement. Mice were treated with SB-3CT eye drops (twice daily for 1 week, 5 μL per drop; 50, 100, or 200 μM). The outgrowth of blood and lymphatic vessels, and macrophage recruitment were analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. The expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and its receptor VEGFR-3 were tested by real-time PCR.
2::This was a blinded and randomized trial in which fifty healthy subjects taste tested iopamidol (Isovue, Bracco Diagnostics), iohexol (Omnipaque, GE Healthcare), diatrizoate meglumine and diatrizoate sodium solution (Gastrografin, Bracco Diagnostics), and barium sulfate suspension 2.1% w/v, 2.0% w/w (READI-CAT2, E-Z-EM). Participants scored palatability on a continuous scale from 0 to 40 (0 = intolerable, 10 = unpleasant but tolerable, 20 = neutral, 30 = kind of like, 40 = strongly like).
2::This cross-sectional analysis included 5296 individuals who underwent a preventive medical examination between October 2006 and June 2013 at our institution. Magnetic resonance imaging, including magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, was performed using a 3.0-T system as part of a comprehensive health screening program. We investigated the prevalence and risk factors of PCLs.
2::Forty-five extracted human single-rooted teeth were used for this study. The samples were divided into three groups (n = 15) according to the instrumentation technique used: manual instrumentation (K-File), rotary instrumentation (ProTaper), and reciprocating instrumentation (Reciproc R25). Chlorhexidine gel (2%) was used as auxiliary chemical substance during root canal preparation. Longitudinal grooves were carved on the free surfaces of the roots, providing two halves of each root and resulting in 30 samples per group. Each group was randomly divided into three subgroups (n = 10), and substantivity was evaluated after 48 h, 7 days, and 30 days of incubation. The amount of CHX (in mg/mL) was measured through reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance and the Tukey test for post hoc comparisons (α = 0.05).
2::Human PDX-derived PC tumors were implanted directly into the pancreas of NOD.Cg-Prkdc Il2rg/SzJ mice. Tumor growth, metastasis, and muscle wasting were then evaluated.
2::We developed a questionnaire including 29 questions. It was spread out to healthcare professionals working at the future implementation sites (in Austria, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and Great Britain) of the U-PGx project in preparation of an educational programme. Aim of the survey was to analyse the current educational situation at the implementation sites.
2::A computer search was performed to identify all patients who received parotidectomy from January 2009 to December 2011 in Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. Individual case notes were reviewed to retrieve details for analysis.
2::A systematic computer-based literature search was conducted on PubMed database.
2::This post hoc analysis of canagliflozin in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients was divided into Study 1 (pooled analysis of 12- and 24-week placebo-controlled, monotherapy studies) and Study 2 (52-week monotherapy/combination therapy study). The canagliflozin 100 mg group data were compared with placebo or baseline ALT subgroup (baseline ALT >30 or ≤30 U/L) data. The primary endpoint was change in ALT level from baseline. Secondary endpoints were changes in efficacy-related parameters. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated.
2::Ten subjects were chosen to participate in this study (average age 40.6 ± 19.6; age range 22-68). LogMAR acuity, contrast sensitivity, corneal fluorescein staining, and subjective complaints were measured before and after 60 μl of Betadine 5% or saline were applied to one eye (eligibility visit, baseline, 5, 30, and 60 minutes and 4 and 24 hours post-application). Contrast sensitivity at 14 cpd was determined with a spatial two-alternative, forced choice procedure (Beethoven software). The National Eye Institute (NEI) grid pattern was used to grade corneal staining with sodium fluorescein. To avoid the detrimental effects of sodium fluorescein administration on functional vision, the corneal staining baseline was measured at the eligibility visit. Subjective complaints were monitored using the Schein dry eye questionnaire.
2::69 ovarian cancer patients who underwent surgery and completed their primary induction chemotherapy were treated with consolidation carboplatin (AUC 10) based HIPEC and compared to a historical cohort that received surgery and primary chemotherapy alone (n = 69). The demographic and clinical characteristics on which we were primarily focused, included patient age, body mass index, surgery and pathology data, chemotherapy regimen, toxicity, and progression free/overall survival.
2::Sustained stimuli included 2-rev/s, 85% contrast checkerboard patterns of 1- and 2-degree check sizes, whereas transient stimuli comprised 4-rev/s, 10% contrast vertical sinusoidal gratings with column width of 0.25 and 0.50 cycles/degree. We tested two models: an a priori clinical model based on an assumption of at least a minimal (beyond instrumentations margin of error) 2-millisecond lag of transient response latencies behind sustained response latencies in concussed patients and a statistical model derived from the sample data.'
2::This is a longitudinal study of FP cycles from 2012 to 2016. We studied three groups: those without CHC exposure (NO CHC), those with CHC usage with a CHC break (BREAK), and without a break (NO BREAK) prior to ovarian stimulation. We assessed ovarian reserve by AFC at initial consultation and discussed the possibility of CHC suppression of AFC. Patients chose between ovarian stimulation with no CHC break versus ovarian stimulation after a CHC break. AFC was measured serially in the BREAK group. We assessed whether AFC suppression was reversed in the BREAK group. Total oocyte yield was compared among the NO CHC, BREAK, and NO BREAK groups. T tests, ANOVA, and linear/logistic regressions were used.
2::In a retrospective interventional case series of 58 eyes of 58 patients with PCV, we assessed best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), central choroidal thickness (CCT), and number of injections for 2 years. Polypoidal lesions were also evaluated before treatment and after the loading phase by indocyanine green angiography.
2::Searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycINFO and in references of key articles, until November 2016 (PROSPERO: CRD42016041401). Instruments used to assess the impact of COPD on caregivers were identified and their properties described. Quality of studies was rated using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist. Quality of the measurement properties of instruments was rated as positive', 'negative' or 'indeterminate'.'
2::This was a post-hoc analysis of pooled data from MENSA (N = 576; NCT01691508) and SIRIUS (N = 135; NCT01691521), two randomized, placebo controlled trials of mepolizumab in patients with severe asthma. Patients completed the SGRQ at Baseline and Exit (MENSA Week 32; SIRIUS Week 24). Distributional characteristics, internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, known-groups validity and responsiveness were assessed.
2::In a single-center open-label trial, 35 patients with inadequate glycemic control on sitagliptin therapy (50 mg once daily) were randomly switched to treatment with vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) or alogliptin (25 mg once daily). After 12 weeks, patients who failed to achieve the target HbA1c level of < 7.0% with vildagliptin or alogliptin treatment were switched to high-dose sitagliptin (100 mg once daily) and the effect on glycemic control was assessed.
2::Using the Aperio ScanScope XT at a magnification of 20× we created digital whole-slide images of 20 representative microscopic cross sections of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, stained with either hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Movats pentachrome stain. These cross sections illustrated a variety of luminal profiles and degrees of stenosis. Three representative types of images were selected and a visual guide was constructed with Adobe Photoshop CS5. Using the ""Scale"" and ""Measurement"" tools, we created a series of representations of stenosis with luminal cross sections depicting 20%, 40%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% occlusion of the LAD branch. Four pathologists independently reviewed and scored the degree of atherosclerotic luminal narrowing based on our visual guides. In addition, digital technology was employed to determine the degree of narrowing by measuring the cross-sectional area of the 20 microscopic sections of the vessels, first assuming no narrowing and then comparing this to the percent of narrowing determined by precise measurement.'
2::In a prospective cohort study, data were collected 3, 6, and 12 months after discontinuation of ECMO and discharge. Postal surveys included the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, the EuroQol-5-Dimensions-5-Levels health questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Telephone interviews were used to track adverse physical outcomes. The Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status questionnaire was administered at the end of each call.
2::The sample consisted of 3 groups: 27 patients admitted to intensive care during a 7- to 14-day period who received mechanical ventilation, 29 patients admitted during the same period who did not receive mechanical ventilation, and 27 healthy patients who had no lesions in the mouth. For all 3 groups, samples were collected from the buccal mucosa by using cytology brushes. Smears were applied to glass slides before Papanicolaou staining and were codified for blind analyses by a cytopathologist. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests were used to analyze the results.
2::We analyzed subcortical brain morphology and compared the shape changes with clinical and neuropsychological features in patients with chronic insomnia.
2::A clinical data set including scores on the Chinese versions of the ISI and the PSQI obtained from 114 insomnia patients prior to and after a 6-week CBT-I program in Taiwan was analyzed. A series of measurement invariance (MI) tests were conducted to compare the factorial parameters of the ISI and the PSQI before and after the CBT-I treatment program.
2::The relevant clinical studies on the diagnostic value of CTA were searched on PubMed, Embase and other electronic documents databases with the deadline of 2016 September. Language was limited to English. A diagnostic meta-analysis was performed by using Meta-DiSc software. The effect sizes included sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The Cochran-Q test and I(2) statistic based on χ(2) test were used for estimation of the heterogeneity. Meta-regression was performed to explore the source of heterogeneity. SROC curve was established.
2::This paper utilized data from two waves of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, a cohort study that follows a representative population of children in Australia. This paper examined data from Waves 4 and 5 of the LSAC (covering the period 2010-2012) and included 3974 children aged 10-11 years at Wave 4 (51.4% male). Multiple dimensions of sleep quality were assessed using a combination of child- and parent-reported measures. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed through the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory.
2::From January 2003 to June 2016, all patients who underwent surgical treatment for periampullary carcinoma by CDP at our institution and with adequate pre- and postoperative CT scans were included. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to determine factors associated with very early HM and recurrence.
2::Participants were assigned to rhythm-and-music therapy, horse-riding therapy, or control using concealed randomization, stratified with respect to sex and stroke laterality. Therapy was given twice a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was change in participants perception of stroke recovery as assessed by the Stroke Impact Scale with an intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary objective outcome measures were changes in balance, gait, grip strength, and cognition. Blinded assessments were performed at baseline, postintervention, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up.'
2::We evaluated neurological symptoms/signs, and results of brain diffusion-weighted resonance imaging (DW-MRI), electroencephalographic recordings (EEG) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker studies in 120 patients with a definite (n=93) or probable (n=27) diagnosis of sCJDVV2.
2::Twenty-five patients (50 affected optic nerves) with chronic LHON and 28 healthy controls (56 normal optic nerves) were enrolled. The rFOV-DTI was performed in the bilateral optic nerves for all the subjects. The fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), principal eigenvalue (λ//), and orthogonal eigenvalue (λ⊥) were calculated for quantitative analysis. Visual field (VF) and visual acuity (VA) were measured in all subjects. The peripapillary RNFL thickness was assessed using optical coherence tomography (OCT). The correlation of DTI diffusion parameters with visual function and peripapillary RNFL thickness was evaluated.
2::A thorax phantom containing 100 calcifications was scanned with the reference protocol (120kVp, 90 ref mAs, FBP) and 30 dose-reduced protocols (70-110kVp, 90 ref mAs, FBP and iterative reconstruction (IR) levels 1-5) with 3rd generation dual-source CT. For protocols that yielded similar detectability and calcium scores as the reference protocol, additional scans were acquired at reduced ref mAs. Kendalls τb and independent-samples-median test were used to determine trends and differences in contrast/signal-to-noise ratio (CNR and SNR), dose and calcium scores.'
2::We searched for studies published through December 2015 that evaluated systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in comatose patients. Two authors independently selected and evaluated full-length reports of randomized clinical trials or prospective cohorts in patients aged >16 years that evaluated the impact of systemic antibiotics at the time of intubation on EO-VAP compared to placebo or no prophylaxis. The outcome variables were the incidence of EO-VAP, the duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and ICU mortality.
2::We performed an epigenome-wide association study of COPD and spirometric parameters, including forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1/FVC, in blood DNA using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 (n = 100, a Korean COPD cohort).
2::CT and MR (SPACE, TrueFISP, VIBE) images were acquired from the left knee joint of a fresh-frozen cadaver. The distal femur, proximal tibia, proximal fibula and patella were manually segmented from the MR and CT examinations. The MR bone models obtained from manual segmentations of all three sequences were compared to CT models using a similarity measure based on absolute mesh differences.
2::We randomized 932 veterans at high risk for developing a KC to either topical 5-FU or vehicle control cream applied to the face and ears for up to 1 month. We collected their Skindex-29 and SCI scores at baseline and follow-up visits.
2::In this prospective, IRB-approved study, 40 PAD patients (30 male, mean age 72 years) underwent CTA on a dual-source CT scanner at 80kV tube voltage. The reference amplitude for tube current modulation was personalized based on the body mass index (BMI) with 120 mAs for [BMI≤25] or 150 mAs for [25<BMI≤30]. Iterative image reconstruction was applied. The presence of significant stenoses (>70%) was assessed by two readers independently and compared to subsequent DSA. Radiation exposure was assessed with the computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol) and the dosis-length product (DLP). Objective image quality was assessed via contrast- and signal-to-noise ratio (CNR and SNR) measurements. Radiation exposure and image quality were compared between the BMI groups and between the BMI-adjusted ultra-low-dose protocol and the low-dose institutional standard protocol (ISP).
2::Among 3285 alteplase-treated patients (mean age, 66.6 years; 38% women) randomly assigned to low-dose (0.6 mg/kg) or standard-dose (0.9 mg/kg) intravenous alteplase within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, 752 (22.9%) reported prior APT use. Primary outcome at 90 days was the combined end point of death or disability (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] scores, 2-6). Other outcomes included mRS scores 3 to 6, ordinal mRS shift, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage by various standard criteria.
2::In a 4-week, placebo-controlled crossover design (Study 201; N = 33) and a 12-week parallel-group design (Study 202; N = 93), JZP-110 was evaluated in narcolepsy patients using changes from baseline in the 40-min MWT as the primary endpoint. Effect sizes based on the change from baseline in mean MWT sleep latency were calculated using 20-min censored MWT data and compared to 40-min MWT data.
2::We analyzed data on 139 Chinese patients with class III/IV ± V LN diagnosed from January 1983 to December 2013. We also compared data before and after 1998, when maintenance immunosuppression was changed from azathioprine (AZA) to mycophenolic acid (MPA).
2::Using alternate definitions of adherence, patients were classified as adherent ""timely"" anti-TNF users, nonadherent ""late"" anti-TNF users, adherent nonusers (""no anti-TNF need""), nonadherent nonusers (""unmet anti-TNF need""). Multivariate models were fitted to examine the effect of adherence on quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), total costs, and nonbiologic costs 1 year following an index date. Generalized linear regression models assuming a γ-distribution with log link were used for costs outcomes and linear regression models for QALY outcomes.
2::During the period between January 2014 and December 2016, a total number of 132 laparoscopic surgeries were performed for bening adnexal masses in our clinic. Seventy women underwent CLS and 62 women underwent MLS. Pathological results and operating time of procedures, estimated blood loss, preoperative and postoperative complications, patient scale and observer scale (POSAS) and length of hospital stay were recorded.
2::We performed an age- and gender-matched case-control study of 187 female sex workers and 374 women without sex work. Cases and controls were tested for the presence of E. histolytica IgG antibodies using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassay. Seroprevalence association with the characteristics of female sex workers was determined by bivariate analysis.
2::Protein conformational changes and aggregation after loading and release was evaluated by circular dichroism (CD), steady-state tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, electrophoresis and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Finally, the capacity of both released proteins to bind to VEGF was tested by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology.
2::The prevalence of physical conditions and mental health disorders, and patterns of service use for any reason and service use for mental health issues were compared among Ontario adults with IDD and HIV (n = 107) and without HIV (n = 63 901) in log-binomial models adjusted for age, sex and neighbourhood income and rurality.
2::Before consultation, patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Survey. After the consultation, the gastroenterologist recorded whether they believed the patient was anxious and depressed and if so, whether any further action had been taken.
2::Several meta-analyses have attempted to clarify the debate. Arguably the most influential is the Appendicitis Acuta (APPAC) Trial.
2::The authors conducted a retrospective observational study of the relationships between opioid prescription, pain intensity, and pain catastrophizing in 1,794 adults (1,129 women; 63%) presenting for new evaluation at a large tertiary care pain treatment center. Data were sourced primarily from an open-source, learning health system and pain registry and secondarily from manual review of electronic medical records. A binary opioid prescription variable (yes/no) constituted the dependent variable; independent variables were age, sex, pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, depression, and anxiety.
2::In this study of 251 adult patients who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass procedures at a single center from 2003 to 2006, cases (patients with a postoperative stroke at least 24 hours after surgery) were matched 1:2 to controls without stroke. Minimum and average partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) values, from arterial blood gas values during and up to 24 hours after surgery, were evaluated as continuous and categorical predictors. Conditional logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders (demographics, comorbidities, and intraoperative variables) were used to evaluate associations between PaO2 variables and stroke status.
2::A total of 70 girls (aged 12.2 ± 1.5 years in 1997) who had been born preterm (at 34.7 ± 1.86 weeks, none having experienced bronchopulmonary dysplasia) took part in spriometric examinations in 1997 and again in 1998. Of those, after a gap of 17 years, a group of 12 were successfully recontacted and participated in the 2015 examination as adults (then aged 27.6 ± 2.6 years, born at 34.5 ± 1.92 weeks).

2::One hundred and six pwMS (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS 0-6.5) stratified in three sub-groups (Class 1 EDSS 0-1.5, Class 2 EDSS 2-4 and Class 3 EDSS 4.5-6.5) and 42 healthy controls (HC) participated in the study. All underwent static posturography and instrumented Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) performed using a wearable inertial sensor. Raw data were processed to extract postural sway features, overall duration of TUG and its main sub-phases (i.e. sit-to-stand, 180° turns and stand-to-sit).
2::We reviewed pathology reports from 9171 children (ages 0-18) with at least 1 duodenal biopsy, and 8280 children with at least 1 esophageal biopsy, with specimens submitted to a national pathology laboratory. Frequency of adherence to diagnostic guidelines and recommendations for CD and EoE were determined, and the effect of this upon detection of CD and EoE.
2::We conducted a matched cohort study of all patients who underwent truncal or super-selective vagotomy and a comparison cohort, by linking Danish population-based medical registries (1977-1995). Hazard ratios (HRs) for multiple sclerosis, adjusting for potential confounders were computed by means of Cox regression analysis.
2::In this cross-sectional comparative study, we measured AVP by color M-mode and CIMT by using Philips QLAB-IMT software in 100 patients, who underwent conventional coronary angiogram (CAG) between May 2013 and November 2014. Coronary artery disease is considered significant if >50% diameter stenosis is present in any epicardial coronary artery and insignificant if otherwise.
2::All computed tomographic (CT) scans of the abdomen and pelvis from patients between the ages 2 and 16 years over a 3-year period at a single institution were evaluated. Patients were excluded if the CT was performed as part of a trauma evaluation or for a history of neuromuscular disease or spinopelvic instrumentation. A total of 821 CT were included. The width of pubic symphysis, right and left SI joints, and each limb of the triradiate cartilages was measured using the PACS digital measurement tool. Left and right measurements of the SI joints and triradiate cartilage were combined and reported together.
2::Between September 2009 and December 2014, 1484 patients with TBI were treated at our institution, 57 of whom had mTIH after TBI and were include in this study. We performed propensity score matching to establish a control group among the 823 patients with TBI treated during the same period. Patients with TBI rated their headaches prospectively using a numeric rating scale (NRS). We compared NRS scores between mTIH group (n = 57) and non-mTIH group (n = 57) and evaluated risk factors of moderate-to-severe PTH (NRS ≥ 4) at the 12-month follow-up.
2::Patients with functional and degenerative MR at high surgical risk in the EVEREST II High-Risk Registry and REALISM Continued-Access Study were linked to Medicare data. Pre- and post-MitraClip all-cause death, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure (HF), and bleeding hospitalizations were identified. Inpatient costs, adjusted to 2010 US dollars, were calculated, and event rate ratios and cost ratios were estimated with multivariable modeling.
2::We analyzed a cohort of adults (≥18 years old) with a Fontan circulation who underwent at least 2 maximal CPETs separated by 6-30 months at Boston Childrens Hospital between 2000 and 2015. Survival analysis was performed to determine whether changes in CPET variables, including pVO2 between consecutive tests, were associated with subsequent clinical events. The primary outcome was transplant-free survival.'

2::TAVRs performed in 48 centers across France between January 2013 and December 2015 were prospectively included in the FRANCE TAVI (French Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) registry. Findings were further compared with those reported from the FRANCE 2 (French Aortic National CoreValve and Edwards 2) registry, which captured all TAVRs performed from January 2010 to January 2012 across 34 centers.
2::Data from the GWTG-CAD database were used. We analyzed 82,971 consecutive acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients treated at 276 US centers from 2003 to 2008. The country was geographically divided into warmer southern and colder northern states using latitude 35 degrees for this purpose.
2::Twelve 1-year cohorts who participated in a comprehensive employer-sponsored lifestyle intervention program targeting diet, exercise, behavior modification, and stress management between 2006 and 2010 at a rural university in Appalachian Ohio were studied. Body composition, fasting glucose and lipid levels, and maximal oxygen consumption were measured at baseline, after 100 days, and at 1 year. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were conducted to compare measures at baseline with measures at 100 days and at 1 year.
2::We enrolled a consecutive series of 397 symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (≥50% stenosis on conventional angiography) treated with carotid artery stenting at 2 tertiary university hospitals over a decade. Definition of periprocedural complications included any stroke, myocardial infarction, and death within 1 month after or during the procedure. Statin pretreatment was divided into 3 categories according to the atorvastatin equivalent dose: none (n=158; 39.8%), standard dose (<40 mg of atorvastatin, n=155; 39.0%), and high dose (≥40 mg; n=84; 21.2%). A multivariable logistic regression analysis with the generalized estimating equation method was used to investigate independent factors in periprocedural complications.
2::A review of the charts of 5 patients treated with TSCPC as primary glaucoma surgery who developed Urrets-Zavalia syndrome.
2::Extracts of M. paniculata made with petroleum ether (60-80 °C), chloroform, ethanol and water were evaluated for antianxiety and antidepressant activity. The anxiolytic chloroform extract was subjected to column chromatography, yielding five fractions (F1-F5). Fraction F5 (100 mg/kg), which showed notable anxiolytic activity, was further chromatographed to get four subfractions (F5.1-F5.4). Simultaneously, the ethanol extract was partitioned with ethyl acetate to obtain ethyl acetate soluble fraction (EASF) and ethyl acetate insoluble fraction. Phytochemical screening of bioactive extracts/fractions and detection of mahanimbine in M. paniculata leaf extract by thin-layer chromatography was also carried out.
2::Three databases were searched for articles from inception to March 2017. The search strategy followed Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. The Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist was applied to evaluate methodological quality.
2::Patients who were diagnosed with UCs or OCs on the basis of final pathology reports and who underwent surgery between January 1993 and January 2015 were included in the study. Data of patients were obtained from Gynecological Oncology Clinic electronic database and patient files.
2::Online interviews with open-ended questions and purposive sampling were used. Participants were dominantly psychologists or lecturers in clinical psychology area. Ten males and 12 females with an average age of 28.0 ± 2.5 years voluntarily participated in this study. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and reviewed and analysed by the two authors to ensure accuracy of interpretation.
2::This observational cohort study was conducted using high-fidelity simulation and multidisciplinary obstetric teams in order to evaluate the validity and reliability of the previously developed PETRA scale for the assessment of teamwork in the management of obstetric crises. Two high-fidelity simulations of preeclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) were conducted 50 times; 42 were performed by multidisciplinary teams and eight (four ""good,"" four ""poor"") were performed by actors. Five raters used the PETRA tool to assess the simulation video recordings. Three additional raters assessed each performance without the use of PETRA as ""good"" or ""poor"" in order to provide an overall rating (referred to as the standardized score). The primary outcome measure was the PETRA score. Cronbachs alpha and intra-class correlation coefficients (2,1) with 95% CIs were calculated to examine internal consistency of the scale and level of agreement among raters, respectively. Construct validity was established by comparing the assessments of the raters with the standardized scores. Generalizability theory analysis was performed to demonstrate PETRA's reliability and to investigate the sources of variation in scores.'
2::The current study was conducted during the formative phase of cluster-randomized trials of oral-fluid HIVST distribution. Young people aged 16-25 years were purposively selected for in-depth interviews (n = 15) in Malawi and 12 focus group discussions (n = 107) across countries. Representative samples of young people in both countries (n = 341) were administered discrete choice experiments on HIVST delivery, with data analyzed to estimate relative preferences. The qualitative results provided additional depth and were triangulated with the quantitative findings.
2::93 patients (mean age 56 years, range 23-79) undergoing breast MRI for routine clinical indications on a 1.5T scanner were eligible for this IRB-approved prospective study. Suspicious enhancing lesions ≥8mm underwent single-voxel point-resolved (1)H-MRS (PRESS, TR=2000ms, TE=272ms). Histology showed 69 malignant and 24 benign lesions. The Signal-to-Noise ratio of choline, olefinic acids and the water-to-methylene ratio were measured. The area under the ROC-curve (AUC) was used to evaluate single measurements. Combined diagnostic accuracy was explored using a 10-fold cross-validated Chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID) analysis. Inter-reader agreement was evaluated in a subset of patients.
2::Twenty five patients with known metastasized melanoma and with incidental finding of cardiac metastases during routine staging CT were retrospectively included in this study.

2::Data were collected from China National Health Service Surveys in 2008 and 2013, covering 94 rural counties and 156 urban districts, respectively, with a total of 15,984 DM patients. Household data and facility-based data at county/district level were merged. The health workforce was measured by number of physicians per 1,000 population in county hospitals and primary health centers (PHCs), respectively. Health care seeking behavior was measured by health care utilization and distribution of health providers of the DM patients. Multilevel zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to analyze the impact of the health workforce on outpatient visits by DM patients, and a multilevel, multinomial logit model was used to examine the impact of the health workforce on choice of health providers by DM patients.
2::We conducted 98 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with ASHAs (n = 49) and their family members (n = 49) in Gurdaspur and Mewat districts. Data were analyzed by comparing and contrasting codes leading to the identification of patterns which were explained with the help of a theoretical framework.
2::Patients that received local infiltration with LB were strictly matched to a control group, and compared for postoperative pain, opioid use, length of stay (LOS), hospital costs, and complication, readmission, and reoperation rates.
2::In this qualitative study within a mixed-method evaluation of the gatekeeping pilot, we developed an innovative systems analysis method, combining the World Health Organisation categorisation of health system building blocks, the ""Framework"" approach of policy analysis and causal loop analysis. We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 stakeholders from 4 groups (patients, doctors, health facility managers and government administrators) in the pilot area over two years. Based on information extracted from the interviews, we drew a causal loop diagram which highlighted the feedback loops within the system that had self-reinforcing or self-balancing characteristics, and used the diagram to examine systematically the mechanisms of intended and actual functioning of gatekeeping and analyse the systems level challenges that affected the effectiveness of gatekeeping.
2::We did an interrupted time series analysis of incident reports of physical assault 30 months before and 12 months after the implementation of the policy in the inpatient wards of South London and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust, London, UK. We used a quasi-Poisson generalised additive mixed model to model the monthly incidence of physical assaults as a function of several explanatory variables.
2::This was a cross-sectional study of baseline data from a clustered randomized controlled trial. The study design had passed a cross-national peer review and accepted grants by the China Medical Board. It was also registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-OOR-14005563). A standardized questionnaire adapted from a previous validated WHO questionnaire was used for the survey which included detailed questions about patients socio-demographic characteristics and self-reported information. Patients' HRQL was measured by the Mandarin version of the 36-item Short Form. We used the validated Mandarin version of the Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease 6-Item Scale to assess patients' self-management efficacy. The validated three-item Brief Health Literacy Screening (BHLS) was used to measure the patients' health literacy. A structural equation model was constructed, and p ≤ 0.05 was taken as significant.'
2::Serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was measured in two cohorts of children who received their first dose of MenBvac® at 1-5years of age and accepted to provide a blood sample either one or four years after a 2+1+1 schedule. All sera were tested against the outbreak strain. Sera from responder subjects were also tested against 12 additional B or C strains which were chosen to entirely, partially, or not at all match the two variable regions (VR1 and VR2) of the PorA vaccine strain.
2::Post intervention qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with six counsellors from the AFrica Focus on Intervention Research for Mental health (AFFIRM-SA) randomised controlled trial on their perceptions of delivering a task shared psycho-social intervention for perinatal depression.

All participants received a challenge dose of a monovalent hepatitis B vaccine (HBVaxPro® 5µg). The concentrations of antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) were measured before and 1month after the challenge dose. The analysis was descriptive and no formal hypothesis was tested.
2::Single pancreatic cancer cells (HPAF-II) were isolated using laser microdissection. WGA was performed using multiple displacement amplification (MDA), multiple annealing and looping based amplification (MALBAC) and PicoPLEX. Quality of amplified DNA products were assessed using a multiplex/RT-qPCR based method that evaluates for 8-cancer related genes and QC-scores were assigned. We utilized this scoring system to assess the impact of de novo modifications to the WGA protocol. WGA products were subjected to Sanger sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and next generation sequencing (NGS) to evaluate their performances in respective downstream analyses providing validation of the QC-score.
2::We analysed primary health-care data on 510,502 adults aged 55 and over. We generated standardised prevalence rates by age-groups, gender, and neighbourhood deprivation, then calculated age, sex and deprivation adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for those with PD compared to those without, for the prevalence, and number of conditions.
2::A panel of 37 biomarkers from different pathophysiological domains (e.g., myocardial stretch, inflammation, angiogenesis, oxidative stress, hematopoiesis) were measured at admission and after 24 h in 843 acute heart failure patients from the PROTECT trial. HFpEF was defined as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥50% (n = 108), HFrEF as LVEF of <40% (n = 607), and HFmrEF as LVEF of 40% to 49% (n = 128).

2::We selected 30 eligible patients according to inclusion and exclusion criteria and randomly assigned them to the control (no end-plate perforation) or study (end-plate perforation) group. Each patient was evaluated in 5 different periods, where data were collected [preoperative and 6-mo follow-up magnetic resonance imaging and functional outcome data: visual analogue scale (VAS) back, VAS legs, Oswestry disability index (ODI)]. Intervertebral space volume (ISV) and height (ISH) were measured form the magnetic resonance images. Statistical analysis was performed using paired t test and linear regression. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
2::Women 21 years and older with breast cancer or increased risk of breast cancer undergoing immediate post-mastectomy reconstruction were identified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. Safety net hospitals were defined as hospitals with the highest tertile of Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payment adjustments. Adjusted odds ratios of undergoing reconstruction were calculated.
2::This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent instrumented lumbar fusions utilizing rhBMP-2. Hospital finance records were used to calculate direct total expenditure incurred by the primary payer for the procedure using rhBMP-2. For patients who received rhBMP-2 in a secondary lumbar fusion, additional total expenditure related to the patients failed primary instrumented fusion with ICBG was also sought.'
2::A 9-year-old child with autism spectrum disorder participated in a 20-week gross motor intervention designed to improve the childs overhand throwing ability, which included weekly physical therapy instruction and daily throwing trials using applied behavior analysis approaches.'
2::Sample infants and toddlers had a diagnosis (eg, cerebral palsy) or developmental delay (DD). Colorado Childrens Medicaid administrative outpatient therapy claims (2006-2008) were used to estimate differences, by condition type and number of comorbid chronic conditions (CCCs), of any physical therapy (PT)/occupational therapy (OT) and Medicaid PT/OT spending.'
2::This study included 115 patients who underwent lumbar decompression surgery followed by MRI within 7 days postoperatively. There were 46 patients with early postoperative radicular pain, regardless of whether the pain was mild or similar to that before surgery. The intervertebral level with the smallest DCSA was identified on MRI and compared preoperatively and postoperatively. Risk factors for postoperative radicular pain were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. Subanalysis according to absence/presence of a residual suction drain also was performed.
2::The objective is to investigate 349 patients included in a raltegravir resistance study. The early outcome is defined as a reduction of HIV-1 RNA at week 8. The crude method defines all measurements below the limit of quantification to be equal to the limit of quantification provides biased estimates. Such a reduction is censored by the limit of quantification and is subject to selection bias in observational studies.
2::This is a retrospective study of adult trauma patients with NCTH admitted to four urban Level I trauma centers in the Houston and San Antonio metropolitan areas in 2008 to 2012. Inclusion criteria include named axial torso vessel disruption, Abbreviated Injury Scale chest or abdomen score of 3 or higher with shock (base excess, <-4) or truncal operation in 90 minutes or less, or pelvic fracture with ring disruption. Exclusion criteria include isolated hip fractures, falls from standing, or prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation. After dichotomizing into OPEN, ENDO, and resuscitative thoracotomy (RT) groups based on the initial approach to control NCTH, a mixed-effects Poisson regression with robust error variance (controlling for age, mechanism, Injury Severity Score, shock, hypotension, and severe head injury as fixed effects and site as a random effect) was used to test the hypothesis that ENDO was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality in NCTH patients.
2::The UPFRONT study was an observational cohort study done at the emergency departments of three level-1 trauma centres in the Netherlands, which included patients with mTBI, defined by a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13-15 and either post-traumatic amnesia lasting less than 24 h or loss of consciousness for less than 30 min. Emergency department predictors were measured either on admission with mTBI-comprising injury severity (GCS score, post-traumatic amnesia, and CT abnormalities), demographics (age, gender, educational level, pre-injury mental health, and previous brain injury), and physical conditions (alcohol use on the day of injury, neck pain, headache, nausea, dizziness)-or at 2 weeks, when we obtained data on mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), emotional distress (Impact of Event Scale), coping (Utrecht Coping List), and post-traumatic complaints. The functional outcome was recovery, assessed at 6 months after injury with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE). We dichotomised recovery into complete (GOSE=8) and incomplete (GOSE≤7) recovery. We used logistic regression analyses to assess the predictive value of patient information collected at the time of admission to an emergency department (eg, demographics, injury severity) alone, and combined with predictors of outcome collected at 2 weeks after injury (eg, emotional distress and coping).
2::As part of a larger survey on health and well-being, participants (N = 5,163) reported on their experiences with weight discrimination and their engagement in four high-risk behaviors: current cigarette smoking, driving while intoxicated, risky sexual/drug use behaviors, and seat belt use. Logistic regression was used to test the association between weight discrimination and each behavior, controlling for relevant demographics and BMI.
2::MMD, defined as the inability to walk 400 m, was determined over an average follow-up of 2.6 years. Participants were divided into four subgroups: (1) nonobese (BMI < 30 kg/m(2) ; n = 437); (2) nonobese with high waist circumference (WC > 102 cm [men], > 88 cm [women]; n = 434); (3) class 1 obesity (30 kg/m(2)  ≤ BMI < 35 kg/m(2) ; n = 430); and (4) class 2 + obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2) ; n = 312). Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to test an obesity by intervention interaction.
2::Koalas affected by mange-like lesions were reported by wildlife carers, veterinary practitioners or State Government personnel to the Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences at The University of Melbourne and the School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences at The University of Adelaide. Skin scrapings were taken from live and dead koalas and S. scabiei mites were identified. Tissues from necropsied koalas were examined histologically.
2::The oxygen-sensing paint-on bandage was applied to the left hind limb in a rodent model. Simultaneously, a near-infrared imaging device and Clark electrode were attached to the right and left hind limbs, respectively. Tissue oxygenation was measured under normal, ischemic (aortic ligation), and reperfused conditions.
2::The C-arm devices Siremobil Iso-C 3D (Siemens) and Vision FD Vario 3D (Ziehm) perform an automated orbital rotation around the patient acquiring a 3D image set out of multiple successive fluoroscopic images. We report on technical specifications of the C-arms and our daily experience regarding clinical applicability. Furthermore, 5 spine surgeons evaluated blinded triplanar planes of 40 cervical, thoracic, and lumbar 3D scans that were obtained during routine surgery regarding usability for navigation. We assessed the delineation of cortical bone, artifacts, and overall image quality using a 0-10 numeric rating scale.
2::Intrinsic muscle involvement in the middle digits was recorded in the operative reports of patients undergoing Dupuytrens surgery between October of 2013 and February of 2016. The anatomical variations of diseased fascia were delineated and classified.'
2::A prospective analysis was conducted using consecutive patients with unilateral craniofacial contour deformities who underwent autologous free fat grafting between 2012 and 2015. Standardized ultrasonographic craniofacial soft-tissue thickness measurements were adopted to determine the fat graft retention. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of 12-month postoperative fat graft retention.
2::Relative expression levels of NNT-AS1 in cervical cancer tissues were determined by qRT-PCR. The biologic functions of NNT-AS1 in cervical cancer were explored by MTT assay, transwell assay and flow cytometric analysis in vitro. The influence of NNT-AS1 on tumorigenesis was measured by mice xenograft model. In addition, we evaluated the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by luciferase assay and western blot.
2::Subjects (ages 17-42, n = 21) wore short wavelength-blocking glasses prior to bedtime for 2 weeks. The ipRGC-mediated post illumination pupil response was measured before and after the experimental period. Stimulation was presented with a ganzfeld stimulator, including one-second and five-seconds of long and short wavelength light, and the pupil was imaged with an infrared camera. Pupil diameter was measured before, during and for 60 s following stimulation, and the six-second and 30 s post illumination pupil response and area under the curve following light offset were determined. Subjects wore an actigraph device for objective measurements of activity, light exposure, and sleep. Saliva samples were collected to assess melatonin content. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was administered to assess subjective sleep quality.
2::One thousand one hundred sixty-six stroke-free participants from the NOMAS (Northern Manhattan Study) underwent carotid ultrasound and neuropsychological examination. Among them, 826 underwent a second neuropsychological examination an average of 5 years later. cIMT and plaque were assessed by a standardized B-mode ultrasound imaging and reading protocol. We used multivariable linear regression to examine cIMT, carotid plaque presence, and carotid plaque area as correlates of domain-specific neuropsychological Z scores cross-sectionally and over time. We also investigated possible effect modification by APOE ε4 allele, age, and race/ethnicity.
2::This was a cross-sectional, observational study that took place in the Eye Institute of Thrace, Democritus University, Greece. Eighty eyes formed the KC group, 55 eyes formed the SKC group while 50 normal eyes populated the control group. A self-developed algorithm in visual basic for Microsoft Excel performed a Fourier series harmonic analysis for the posterior corneal sagittal curvature data. The algorithm decomposed the obtained curvatures into a spherical component, regular astigmatism, asymmetry and higher order irregularities for averaged central 4 mm and for each individual ring separately (1, 2, 3 and 4 mm). The obtained values were evaluated for their diagnostic capacity using receiver operating curves (ROC). Logistic regression was attempted for the identification of a combined diagnostic model.
2::MiR-500 expression was assessed by qRT-PCR in prostate cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Cancer patients clinicopathological factors and overall survival were analyzed according to endogenous miR-500 level. MiR-500 was downregulated in DU145 and VCaP cells. Its effect on prostate cancer proliferation, invasion in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo, were probed. Possible downstream target of miR-500, TFPI was assessed by luciferase assay and qRT-PCR in prostate cancer cells. In miR-500-downregulated DU145 and VCaP cells, TFPI was silenced to see whether it was directly involved in the regulation of miR-500 in prostate cancer. TFPI alone was either upregulated or downregulated in DU145 and VCaP cells. Their effect on prostate cancer development was further evaluated.'
2::VA was determined uniocularly for adults under conditions of spherical (0.0-3.0 DS; n = 23) and astigmatic (0.0-3.0 DC at 90° and 180°; n = 20) defocus using the Cardiff Acuity Test (vanishing optotypes), crowded linear Lea Symbols (picture-optotype recognition task) and the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter chart.
2::145 eyes of 145 participants with diabetes but no DPN at baseline were examined for incident DPN.

The parents completed child temperament ratings. The data were analyzed with random and fixed effects regression adjusted for all time-invariant unmeasured confounders (e.g., genetics, common methods bias, item overlap).
2::VF induction was attempted in 31 patients referred for ventricular arrhythmia ablation. Simultaneous surface ECG and intracardiac electrograms were recorded using biventricular basket catheters. Endocardial phase maps were used to mechanistically classify each VF cycle as rotor or focally-driven. ECGs were analyzed from patients demonstrating both mechanisms in the primary analysis and from all patients with induced VF in the secondary analysis. The ECG voltage variation during each mechanism was compared. Biventricular computer simulations of VF driven by focal sources or rotors were created and resulting ECGs of each VF mechanism were compared.

2::Intraoperative data were prospectively collected in 1080 patients undergoing pulmonary resection with OLV, intentional crystalloid restriction, and mechanical ventilation to maintain inspiratory peak airway pressure <30 cm H2O. Other ventilator settings and all aspects of anesthetic management were at the discretion of the anesthesia care team. We defined PLV and non-PLV as <8 or ≥8 mL/kg (predicted body weight) mean tidal volume. The primary outcome was the occurrence of pneumonia and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Propensity score matching was used to generate PLV and non-PLV groups with comparable characteristics. Associations between outcomes and PLV status were analyzed by exact logistic regression, with matching as cluster in the anatomic and nonanatomic lung resection cohorts.

Data were obtained for Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York City, San Francisco, California (excluding San Francisco), and Washington State. Estimates of the MSM, heterosexual male (MSW) and female populations were obtained from recently published estimates and census data. Case rates and rate-ratios were calculated comparing trends in reported cases among MSM, heterosexual males and women.
2::The study was carried out on paraffin-embedded tissues of 30 normal oral mucosa (NOM) and 140 OPMD cases. OPMD cases were classified into two groups no/questionable/hyperkeratosis/mild' = low-risk epithelial dysplasia (LRED) and 'moderate or severe' = high-risk epithelial dysplasia (HRED). The immunohistochemistry was carried out to evaluate the expression of Ki67, CD 105, and α-SMA antigen.'
2::We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of patients with hematological malignancies who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission in 2010-2011. Patients with a main admission diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock were included in the present study. We assessed RBC transfusion during the first two days as part of initial resuscitation.
2::Ten corneoscleral rims were mounted on an artificial anterior chamber (AC). The anterior chamber was filled with air through a limbal paracentesis. A Melles triangulated spatula was inserted through the paracentesis, with its tip penetrating the AC, was then slightly retracted and pushed into the deep stroma above the roof of the paracentesis. A mixture of trypan blue and viscoelastic device (Healon, Abbott Medical Optics, Abbott Park, Illinois) was injected into this intra-stromal pocket using a 27G cannula to create a pre-Descemetic separation bubble. Bubble type and visualization of dyed viscoelastic device were noted. The method was later employed in three cases.'
2::We conducted a retrospective review involving ninety-nine consecutive patients with associated both column fractures of acetabulum treated through single ilioinguinal approach. Patients were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of 35 patients presented with both column fractures with posterior wall involvement that fixation performed with lag screws. This group was compared to a second group of 64 patients with both column fractures without posterior wall involvement. The quality of reduction was assessed using criteria described by Matta. The size of posterior wall fragment was measured. Functional outcome was evaluated using Modified Postel Merle DAubigne score. Radiographs at the latest follow up were analyzed for arthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence classification), and femoral head avascular necrosis (Ficat/Arlet classification).'
2::We studied 28 cases with ANCA-associated vasculitis in the aforementioned area. The classification was made according to the ACR 1990 criteria, the Chapel Hill 2012 consensus, and the EULAR 2007 recommendations. We collected demographic data, as well as data of clinical manifestations, laboratory, management and outcomes. The activity was established using the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) and the damage using the Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI). We used paired t test and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
2::The Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA) study is a cross-sectional, multicentre study conducted in 9 European countries during 2006-2007 and included 3528 adolescents (1683 boys and 1845 girls) between 12.5 and 17.5years of age. Status (ideal vs. non-ideal) for the health behaviours (smoking status, body mass index, physical activity and diet) and health factors (total cholesterol, blood pressure and fasting glucose) were determined.
2::We evaluated patients with HSS with or without concomitant liver cirrhosis. All patients underwent laboratory testing, ultrasound, endoscopy, contrast echocardiography, and arterial blood gas analysis.
2::Sequential echocardiograms were collected retrospectively at two time points between 2005 and 2015 in 187 patients (71% women; mean age, 63 ± 14 years) undergoing pulmonary vasodilator therapy for group 1 PAH. Patients were either studied during PAH therapy (n = 111) or before and after treatment initiation (n = 76). Standard measurements of RV and left ventricular function and PASP were performed, and speckle-tracking strain was used to calculate RVFWS. The linear response of RVFWS to afterload (PASP) was assessed using a standard regression equation. Because it is unclear if the response might be nonlinear, a quadratic association (PASP squared) was also used in the regression model.
2::We compared the proportion of patients with a positive bronchodilator response between two groups of children with asthma, one group in which post-bronchodilator administration wait times were not standardized (pre-intervention) to another in which the wait time was extended to 15 min to adhere to ATS/ERS standards (post-intervention). We also determined the effect of this intervention on clinic appointment duration.
2::Secondary data analyses were conducted of administrative and patient survey data collected as part of a national evaluation of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) mental health and substance use services. Data for patients who received care for substance use disorders during October 2006-September 2007 paid for by the VHA and who participated in a telephone interview about their care (N=2,074) were included. Measures of patient perceptions of care included perceived improvement and global rating of behavioral health care. Eight quality measures based on administrative data assessed initiation and engagement in substance use disorder care, receipt of psychotherapy or psychosocial treatment, and follow-up after hospitalization. Regression models were conducted in which each quality measure predicted each outcome, with analyses adjusting for patient characteristics and functioning.
2::Geometric morphometric analysis was carried out on CT scans of the distal femur of 256 subjects living in the south of France. Ten landmarks were defined on 3D reconstructions of the distal femur. Both traditional metric and geometric morphometric analyses were carried out on these bone reconstructions. These analyses were used to identify trends in bone shape in various age-based subgroups (<40, 40-60, >60).
2::All adult patients with a diagnosis of oesophageal cancer managed at our institute from 2005 to 2015 were included in this retrospective study. Patients demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded through our hospital information system. The cohort of esophagectomies was allocated into two groups, conventional open esophagectomy (OE) or total laparoscopic MIE; hybrid esophagectomies were taken as a separate group. The short-term outcome measures are an operative time in minutes, length of hospital and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay in days, post-operative complications and 30 days in-hospital mortality. Complications are graded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification system. Long-term outcomes are long-term procedure related complications over a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Trends were analysed by visually inspecting the graphic plots for mean number of events in each group each year.'
2::Retrospective longitudinal cohort analyses were performed with Truven MarketScan Commercial (2010-2014) and Medicaid (2010-2013) databases. Among inpatients with schizophrenia (N=25,401) or bipolar disorder (N=46,375), overall and stratified associations were examined between receipt of an outpatient follow-up visit in the 30 days postdischarge and hospital readmission during days 31-120 postdischarge.
2::A consecutive patient prospective study was performed. A total of 522 patients who had a procedure involving incision of the periocular skin with subsequent postoperative application of NPD ophthalmic ointment were included. Patients were evaluated for signs of allergy at 1 week postoperatively or prior if the patient had complaints. A periocular allergic reaction was defined as any periocular skin pruritus, erythema, edematous papules, vesicles, or plaques at the site of ointment application beyond that of the typical postprocedure presentation. The patients continued to be monitored for 30 days postoperatively.
2::All live-born HF patients with pleural effusion, except for chromosomal abnormality or complex congenital heart disease, born from 2009 to 2013 in Aichi Prefecture in Japan were included. The prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal information was obtained from their medical records and was retrospectively analyzed.
2::We reviewed the HPO database for all diseases, including causative genes related to CULA. All CULA were classified according to the OMT classification; associated non-hand phenotypes were classified into 12 anatomical groups. We analyzed the contribution of each anatomical group to a given disease and developed a tool for differential diagnosis formulation based on these contributions. We compared our results with cases from the literature and with a current HPO tool, Phenomizer.
2::A tumor cell suspension (CC531) was applied at the cecum after laparotomy and at the back. The rats where treated twice a day over 1 week with BTB14431, emodin and isotone sodium chloride solution (control). Treatment was applied iv or ip in a variety of dosages. Peripheral blood samples were taken before tumor application and on day 7. Twenty-one days after the last day of therapy animals were euthanized and tumor growth was evaluated.
2::109 deceased donor kidney transplants were included. 5-year probability of graft survival was calculated during transplantation, seven days after transplantation and 1-year after transplantation. Z-test and ROC curves were used for proportion differences and discrimination ability.
2::Billing data from the outpatient sector were analyzed for all persons covered by statutory health insurance in the two-year period 2014-2015. A cohort of pregnant women, constructed by using pregnancy care billing data, was studied with respect to the screening coverage. The prevalence of GDM was determined from the use of the corresponding ICD-10-GM codes.
2::Using the Medicaid Analytic eXtract database for 29 states from 1999 to 2010, investigators established ten two-year cohorts of pediatric and adult patients who received two or more psychotropic drugs with a 45-day overlapping days supply. Among PMP initiators, the prevalence of psychotherapy services, identified from encounter claims via Current Procedural Terminology and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes, was calculated for the six months before and the six months after initiation of PMP.'
2::Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, who had never taken etanercept (Enbrel), took part in a mail survey. They were presented with a hypothetical decision scenario where they were asked to consider adding etanercept to their current regimen. Each patient was randomized to review 1 of 3 forms of an etanercept-specific decision support: a long PtDA (LONG DA), a short PtDA (SHORT DA), or the manufacturers Enbrel decision guide (Pharm Booklet).'
2::In the vaginal laxity arm of the study, 25 women with subjective sensation of vaginal introital laxity (very to slightly loose). Assessment of urinary incontinence, satisfaction with sexual relationship and contribution of pelvic organ prolapse: Vaginal Laxity Questionnaire (VLQ, Italian certified translation) and short form of the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12, Italian certified translation). Further evaluation of sexual gratification: Sexual Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ). In the VVA/GSM arm of the study, 32 women with objective evidence of VVA and vaginal dryness and/or dyspareunia as most bothersome symptoms. Assessment of VVA/GSM symptoms and overall satisfaction with sexual life: specifically designed 10-cm visual analogue scales.
2::The PubMed/Medline database was searched from inception to January 16, 2016 for randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials investigating the antidepressant efficacy of psychostimulants in the treatment of adults with unipolar or bipolar depression.
2::Forty-one patients (mean age 63 ± 13 years, 31 male) with hepatic tumors (18 hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC], six cholangiocarcinoma [CCC], 10 metastatic tumors, one neuroendocrine malignancy, and six benign lesions) underwent FDG PET/MRI before treatment. Maximum standard uptake (SUVmax) values from FDG PET and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from the diffusion-weighted images were obtained for the tumor and their relationships were examined. We also investigated the difference in SUVmax and ADC for each type of tumor.
2::Serum sampling and clinical assessments from 115 alcohol-dependent subjects admitted to a psychiatric hospital for alcohol were repeated during the first 48 hours of withdrawal (M0) and 1, 2, 4 and 6 months (M1, M2, M4, M6) after. Serum factors were determined with Luminex technology or by ELISA.
2::This was an observational study conducted in the outpatient clinic of a psychiatric hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In a previous study, 120 patients diagnosed as having PD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria were randomized to receive clonazepam or paroxetine. After 3 years, treatment was discontinued in patients who had achieved remission. These subjects were included in the current study and were followed up for 6 years. The follow-up assessments were made at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 years after treatment discontinuation. Assessment included the number of panic attacks per month, Clinical Global Impression-Severity, and other measures. Patients who had initiated psychotherapy or pharmacological treatment because of PD symptoms or who had Clinical Global Impression-Severity scores greater than 1 or panic attacks in the month preceding the assessment were considered relapse cases. Data were collected from January 2003 to August 2012.
2::A systematic review of the literature was performed from database inception to November 2014, together with the collection of original data on socio-economic indicators from forty countries.
2::In total, 142 patients (male:female=84:58, mean age=43.5±9.3 years), who were scheduled to undergo a colonoscopy at Myongji Hospital, were enrolled in this study. Seventy-one patients were asked to use a smartphone app that we had recently developed to prepare for the colonoscopy, while the 71 patients of the sex and age-matched control group were educated via written and verbal instructions.
2::A polysomnography was conducted for the diagnosis of OSA in 90 snoring children, in a tertiary hospital. Anthropometric and clinical data were measured and venous blood samples were collected for the measurement of plasma glucose, insulin, HbA1c, and amino acids.
2::Review of the literature.
2::We identified patients with WD panNETs treated with alkylating agents, determined best overall response by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, and performed MGMT activity testing.
2::A total of 81 infants with a gestational age (GA) of 28-34 weeks were eligible and were randomized to nCPAP (n = 42) or to nHFOV (n = 39). The need for IMV was the primary outcome. The incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and air leaks, and mortality were considered as secondary outcomes.
2::The influence of spherical SVL and four different designs of PALs that differ in the near zone width (PAL 1) or that have different signs and magnitude of horizontal gradients of mean power adjacent to their near vision zones (PAL 3 and PAL 4) on the accommodative response was investigated for different near viewing distances (40, 33, and 25 cm) in 31 subjects, aged 18 to 25 years.
2::We developed a model to estimate the national burden of severe pneumococcal disease, i.e. disease requiring hospitalisation, pre- (2005-2008) and post-PCV introduction (2012-2013) in children aged 0-59 months in South Africa. We estimated case numbers for invasive pneumococcal disease using data from the national laboratory-based surveillance, adjusted for specimen-taking practices. We estimated non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia case numbers using vaccine probe study data. To estimate pneumococcal deaths, we applied observed case fatality ratios to estimated case numbers. Estimates were stratified by HIV status to account for the impact of PCV and HIV-related interventions. We assessed how different assumptions affected estimates using a sensitivity analysis. Bootstrapping created confidence intervals.
2::Sixty steers aged 8 months were allotted to two feeding systems and fed similar amounts of average dry matter and total digestible nutrient throughout whole experimental period according to each feeding program. Steers were weighed monthly, taken blood at the end of growing, fattening and finishing periods, and slaughtered at 30 month of age.
2::The cardioprotective effects of different dosages of SND pretreatment on the isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury were compared through a serum metabolomics approach based on ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). In addition, the cardioprotective effects were evaluated by serum biochemical analysis and histopathological examination of myocardial tissue. Finally, in view of the fact that these perturbed bile acid and phospholipid metabolisms are connected with NF-κB signaling pathway, nuclear expression of NF-κB p65 and the activation of NF-κB were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), respectively.
2::Literature searches were conducted to identify studies on patient or consumer attitudes and behaviors toward colorectal cancer screening, nutritional labeling, and influenza vaccination. Publications reporting sex- or gender-specific outcome data constituted the gold standards for this study. The sensitivity and precision of previously published gender-specific filters, as well as individual filter component terms, were calculated and compared with values identified in prior studies.
2::RADG was performed in patients with clinical Stage I gastric cancer, and reconstruction was performed using Delta. The Delta procedure was the same as that performed after LADG, and the operator practiced the procedure in simulated settings with surgical assistants before the operation. After gastrectomy, the scope and robotic first arm were reinserted from separate ports on the right side of the patient. Then, a port on the left side of the abdomen was used as the assistant port from which a stapler was inserted, with the robotic arm in a coaxial mode. The surgical assistant performed functional end-to-end anastomosis of the remnant stomach and duodenal stump using a powered stapler.
2::Tissue T (tT) and tissue DHT (tDHT) concentration were determined in 93 patients scheduled for initial prostate biopsy. The criteria for biopsy were abnormal DRE and/or PSA > 4 ng/mL. Total prostate volume (TPV) was determined by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). During TRUS- guided prostate biopsy, 10-12 samples were collected from the peripheral zone (PZ) and two additional samples were collected from the transition zone (TZ). The samples from the TZ were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen at -70°C, and transported for tissue androgen determination, using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
2::We completed a prospective crossover study, enrolling patients with suspected CP. Patients who underwent both traditional 1-hour secretin pancreatic function test (sPFT) and sEUS were included in the analysis. We compared study results for test concordance and for correlation of peak bicarbonate concentrations.
2::Clinical and pathological data of ECC patients were retrospectively collected by eight Italian institutions. Chi-square test or Fishers exact test along with logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of each variable between patients with or without LNM. Results of logistic regression have been used as a basis to calculate the probability to harboring LNM.'
2::Retrospective analysis of all pleurodesis performed during a 10-year period in a Pulmonology Unit. All demographic and clinical data were collected, including the histologic tumoral type and the biochemical, microbiological and cytological fluid features. Efficacy was defined as the lack of recurrence of pleural effusion. It was used Kaplan-Meyer analysis to estimate overall survival.
2::The National College Health Assessment-II Fall 2012 to 2013 was used for this analysis. The analytic sample was restricted to women who used a LARC method (ie, intrauterine device or implant) (N = 1658). The main outcome was dual method use, LARC and condom, at last sex. An adjusted logistic regression model assessed sociodemographic factors (age, relationship, race), health care utilization (routine gynecological examination), and sexual behavior (number of partners) as factors associated with dual condom-LARC use at the last time of vaginal-sex. Prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated.
2::A pretest-posttest design with control group was employed to investigate the intervention effects in a subsample of 100 children, 51 from the intervention neighborhood and 49 from the control neighborhood. The children wore pedometers for one week, and their parents completed questionnaires at two time points: before the intervention began and during the last two weeks of the intervention. JETB was conducted in the intervention neighborhood from 17:30 to 20:30, twice a week, from September to December 2014. Stewards ensured that the children were safe. Children and adults were assessed using systematic observation.
2::This was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of community-dwelling adults ages 50 to 70 y randomized to once-daily β-1,3/1,6 glucan (Wellmune 250 mg/d; n = 50) or identical placebo capsule (n = 50) over 90 d during winter. URTI episodes were medically confirmed. Symptom severity was recorded via self-reported daily Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Tract Infection Score 21. Blood and saliva samples were collected at days 0, 45, and 90 for measurements of innate immune parameters.
2::Retrospective analysis of monochorionic biamniotic twin pregnancies without signs of chronic TTTS within a period 10/2010 to 10/2013. Further selection of cases with haemoglobin difference in neonates greater than 50 g/l was made, type of feto-fetal haemorrhage was determined and their prenatal and postnatal characteristics were described.
2::We retrospectively reviewed 180 patients who underwent bariatric surgery from August 2013 to August 2014 who had undergone pre-operative screening bilateral lower-extremity venous duplex ultrasound for DVT. Data were collected on patients demographics, history of venous thromboembolism, prior surgeries and duplex ultrasound details of the status of the deep veins and superficial veins of the lower limbs.'
2::We reviewed the clinical and laboratory data in patients with Q fever hepatitis who underwent liver biopsy during a 17-year period, and whose biopsied tissues were available. We also selected patients who revealed granuloma in liver biopsy and with no Q fever diagnosis within the last 3 years as control. Acute Q fever hepatitis was diagnosed if two or more of the following clinical, serologic, or histopathologic criteria were met: (1) an infectious hepatitis-like clinical feature such as fever (≥ 38°C) with elevated hepatic transaminase levels; (2) exhibition of a phase II immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies titer by IFA of ≥ 1:128 in single determination, or a four-fold or greater rise between two separate samples obtained two or more weeks apart; (3) histologic finding of biopsy tissue showing characteristic fibrin ring granuloma.
2::Three hundred fifty women aged 22 to 33 years from the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial provided exfoliated cells from the cervical and oral regions at 2 visits 2 years apart. Samples from both visits were tested for 25 characterized α HPV types by the SPF10 PCR-DNA enzyme immunoassay-LiPA25 version 1 system. Risk factors for oral HPV persistence were calculated utilizing generalized estimating equations with a logistic link.
2::We studied 52 young men between the ages of 18 and 29 y. Participants were clustered to small (SW; n = 32) and large (LW; n = 20) weight, and small (SWH; n = 25) and large (LWH; n = 27) weight-height. REE was measured by indirect calorimetry (REEm), and predicted from DXA metabolic maps with four (REEc1), five (REEc2) and six (REEc3) tissue-organ components.
2::We rely on data from the Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative (SVORI) evaluation and employ cross-lagged panel models to examine short-term changes in substance use and crime over time among a large sample of high-risk, former prisoners (N = 1697).
2::A retrospective, observational, transversal and analytic case-control study was made. All premature birth incidences were determined as study objects and controls were integrated with term deliveries. A sample size of 344 patients with a control per case was calculated. A total of 688 patients were studied. Statistical analysis was descriptive, univariate and bivariate and we used the Pearson chi square test, with a p < 0.05, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
2::The evaluation of the effectiveness was carried out through a systematic review using the Cochrane methodology. It was used Markov model, which considers two states of health (with and without PPAE), with the possibility of weekly transition. Women between 18 and 45 years with PPAE were included, in a temporary horizon of 26 weeks. A level of statistical significance of 95% was used for a p < 0.05, with a multivariate probabilistic analysis of sensibility, as well as a univariate analysis of sensibility in several scenarios.
2::Descriptive, cross-sectional and correlational study with a group of 50 PPwH and their parents. The Pediatric Life Quality Questionnaire [PedsQLTM 4.0] was completed by PPwH and their parents and the Childrens Depression Inventory (CDI) was answered only by PPwH.'
2::For this study, 36 patients were examined using Doppler ultrasonography (US) along with a contrast-enhanced US for surveillance of vascular complications after LT. The following spectral Doppler US parameters were measured before and after administration of USCA: peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, resistive index, and systolic acceleration time of the graft hepatic artery; peak flow velocity of the graft portal vein; and peak flow velocity and venous pulsatility index of the graft hepatic vein.
2::In a randomized, 4-way crossover study, 14 healthy subjects received pulsatile dl-MPH (40 mg) or d-MPH (20 mg), with or without ethanol (0.6 g/kg), dosed 4 hours later. These 4 hours allowed the delayed-release second MPH pulse to reach a more distal region of the gut to preclude gastric biopharmaceutical influences. Plasma was analyzed using a highly sensitive chiral method. Subjective/physiological effects were recorded.
2::Herein, we examined if, relative to a grain-based mouse diet (chow), compositionally defined diet consumption would impact development of intestinal inflammation induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and moreover, whether DSS-induced colitis might also be attenuated by diets supplemented with inulin.
2::Sixteen individuals (M/F: 10/6) ran at self-selected speeds for 800m under three stroller conditions (2-Hands, 1-Hand, and Push/Chase) and an independent running control.
3::Thirteen percent of women were early pregnancy smokers, 20% former smokers, and 68% never smokers. Infants of early pregnancy smokers had lower IGF-1 adjusted for IGFBP-3 [-5.2ng/mL (95% CI: -8.6, -1.7)], with more pronounced associations in girls [-10.7ng/mL (95% CI: -18.5, -2.9) vs. -4.0ng/mL (95% CI: -8.4, 0.4) for boys]. Early pregnancy smoking was not associated with cord blood hormones other than IGF-1. Infants of former smokers had a cord blood hormone profile similar to infants of never smokers.
3::4790 participants (20.9%) had an FLI≥60. NAFLD subjects were older, more likely to be men, more obese and more often had diabetes and metabolic syndrome (P<0.001 for each). Among NAFLD subjects, any apoB dyslipoproteinemia was present in 61.5% vs. 16.5% in subjects without NAFLD (P<0.001). Elevated chylomicrons were not observed in NAFLD. In univariate analysis, NAFLD was associated with a higher prevalence of each apoB dyslipoproteinemia vs. subjects with an FLI<60 (P<0.001), except for low density lipoprotein (LDL) dyslipoproteinemia. Additionally, each apoB dyslipoproteinemia was independently associated with NAFLD in age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression analysis, including the apoB dyslipoproteinemias together (P<0.001). The prevalence of apoB dyslipoproteinemias was not altered in subjects with NFS ≥0.676.
3::The mean total costs associated with failed instrumented lumbar fusion using ICBG and reoperation using rhBMP-2 totaled £47,734 per patient. The total direct costs of a policy of primary instrumented lumbar fusion with rhBMP-2 were less at £26,923 per patient; however, this was not significant.
3::Overall clinical failure occurred in 26% (24 of 91 patients) at 2-year follow-up. Clinical failure occurred in: 28% (Maverick) (7 of 25 patients), 39% (Charité) (12 of 31 patients), and 14% (Kineflex) (5 of 35 patients). Causes of failure included facet pathology, 50% of failure patients (12 of 24). Implant complications occurred in 5% of total patients and 21% of failure patients (5 of 24). Only 5 patients went from a success to failure after 3 months. Only 1 patient went from a failure to success after a facet rhizotomy 1 year after ADR.
3::Overall, 2704 participants were included in the analysis, 18% of them being current smokers and 30.8% former smokers. Current smokers compared to non-smokers had higher total cholesterol (220.6 ± 50.4 versus 213.9 ± 86.8 mg/dl, P = 0.017), LDL-cholesterol (137.8 ± 45.2 versus 130.7 ± 83.7 mg/dl, P = 0.004) and glomerular filtration rate (96.9 ± 16.8 versus 90.7 ± 19.1 ml/min/1.73 m(2), P <0.001) in women and higher triglycerides (170.7 ± 129.8 versus 144.3 ± 94.2 mg/dl, P = 0.007), glomerular filtration rate (97.6 ± 17 versus 90.3 ± 18 ml/min/1.73 m(2), P < 0.001) and lower HDL-cholesterol (48 ± 15.5 versus 50.4 ± 14.1 mg/dl, P = 0.002) in men. Active smoking was associated with hypercholesterolaemia [OR: 1.40 (95% CI: 1.01-1.96), P = 0.04] and low HDL-cholesterolaemia [OR: 1.39 (95% CI: 1.01-1.91), P = 0.04] and negatively associated with overweight/obesity [OR: 0.67 (95% CI: 0.48-0.94), P = 0.02]. Male former smokers had higher prevalence of abdominal obesity (82.4% versus 76.4%, P = 0.02), hypertriglyceridaemia (43.6% versus 35.6%, P = 0.01), hypertension (64% versus 56.4%, P = 0.01) and ischaemic vascular disease (40.5% versus 30.9%, P = 0.003) than male non-smokers.
3::16 out of 33 patients were switched to a generic LEV product. No switchbacks were seen. LEV dose, LEV serum concentrations, fluctuation index and concentration/dose-ratio (C/D-ratio) were not significantly different within-group (baseline vs. study period) or between-group. Large within-subject variability in serum concentrations was seen in both groups. None of the patients that were seizure-free before inclusion experienced seizures while on the generic LEV product.
3::Multivariate regression analysis showed that smaller postoperative DCSA was significantly associated with early postoperative radicular pain (per -10 mm; odds ratio, 1.26). The best cutoff value for radicular pain was early postoperative DCSA of 67.7 mm. Even with a cutoff value of <70 mm, sensitivity and specificity are 74.3% and 75.0%, respectively. Early postoperative DCSA was significantly larger before suction drain removal than after (119.7±10.1 vs. 93.9±5.4 mm).
3::The average age of PPwH was 10.66 years (SD = 2.61) and that of parents was 36.28 years (SD = 6.4). 82% suffered from hemophilia A and 70% suffered from severe hemophilia. 78% of participants felt at risk or at high risk with regards to their quality of life, and, concerning their depression levels, we found moderate symptoms in 54% and severe symptoms in 10%.
3::Five devices met all four electroacoustic tolerances presented in this study, two devices met three tolerances, one device met two tolerances, one device met one tolerance, and one device did not meet any tolerances. Nine devices were able to approximate five of nine National Acoustics Laboratories (NAL) targets within 10 dB while only three devices were able to approximate five of nine NAL targets within a more stringent 5 dB.
3::In the WC group, 84% (n = 221) had resolution of symptoms after the first PRM, versus 82.8% (n = 299) in the NC group. After the second PRM 11% (n = 29) resolved, versus 13.6% (n = 49) in the NC group. After the third PRM 4.9% (n = 13) resolved, versus 3.6% (n = 13) in the NC group. Both clinically and statistically there was no significant difference in outcome between groups.
3::Of the 94 patients, four underwent conservative treatment and 90 underwent operations. Seventy-five patients (79.8%) were followed up for a minimum of 24 months or until death. The median follow-up duration was 75.3 months. The overall recurrence rate was 37.3%. Ten patients (13.3%) died before the last follow-up (median: 18.5 months). Two patients (2.6%) developed osteogenic sarcoma. The local recurrence rate was 80.0% (24/30) in patients who underwent intralesional curettage, 8.8% (3/34) in patients who underwent extracapsular piecemeal spondylectomy, and 0 (0/9) in patients who underwent TES. The risk factors for local recurrence were lesions located in the cervical spine (P = 0.049), intralesional curettage (P < 0.001), repeated surgeries (P = 0.014), and malignancy (P < 0.001). Malignant transformation was a significant risk factor for death (P < 0.001).
3::Percentages of Tc-SC uptake ranged from 19.3 to 77.3% for the liver; 3.4 to 40.7% for the spleen; and 19.0 to 56.7% for the bone marrow. Spearmans correlation coefficient showed a significant statistical association between Child-Pugh score and bone marrow uptake at 0.55 (P≤0.05), liver uptake at 0.71 (P≤0.001), spleen uptake at 0.56 (P≤0.05), and spleen plus bone marrow uptake at 0.71 (P≤0.001). There was also a good correlation of SC uptake percentages with individual quantitative liver function components such as albumin and total bilirubin, and qualitative liver function components (varices, portal hypertension, ascites). For albumin: r=0.64 (P<0.001) compared with liver uptake percentage from the whole-body counts, r=0.49 (P<0.001) compared with splenic uptake percentage, and r=0.45 (P≤0.05) compared with bone marrow uptake percentage.'
3::Participants had a mean (SD) age of 70 (9) years and were 60% women, 66% Hispanic, 15% white, and 18% black. Those with greater cIMT exhibited worse episodic memory after adjustment for demographics and vascular risk factors (β=-0.60; P=0.04). APOE ε4 carriers with greater cIMT exhibited worse episodic memory (β=-1.31; P=0.04), semantic memory (β=-1.45; P=0.01), and processing speed (β=-1.21; P=0.03). Participants with greater cIMT at baseline did not exhibit significantly greater cognitive decline after adjustment. APOE ε4noncarriers with greater cIMT exhibited greater declines in executive function (β=-0.98; P=0.06). Carotid plaque burden was not significantly associated with cognition at baseline or over time.
3::The study demonstrates the versatility of thiolated chitosan-based hydrogels for delivering proteins. The effect of various parameters of the hydrogel on protein release kinetics and mechanism of protein release was studied using the Korsmeyer-Peppas release model. Furthermore, we have studied the stability of released proteins in detail while comparing it with non-entrapped proteins under physiological conditions to understand the effect of formulation conditions on protein stability.
3::Multicolor flow cytometry revealed distinct leukocyte populations and immunological features of patients with X-SCID, XLA, X-HIGM, AT, WAS, HIES, and CMCD.
3::MiR-500 is upregulated in both prostate cancer cells and primary tumors. In prostate cancer patients, high miR-500 expression is associated with poor prognosis and overall survival. In DU145 and VCaP cells, miR-500 downregulation inhibited cancer proliferation, invasion in vitro, and explant growth in vivo. TFPI was verified to be associated with miR-500 in prostate cancer. Downregulation of TFPI reversed anti-cancer effects of miR-500 downregulation in prostate cancer cells. However, neither TFPI upregulation nor downregulation alone had any functional impact on prostate cancer development.
3::Overall HPV prevalence was 27.8%, with 22.2% HR-HPV and 11.4% LR-HPV. The five most common carcinogens were HPV 52 (3.2%), 58 (2.7%), 16 (2.0%), 56 (1.9%), and 51 (1.8%). The five most common HR-HPVs in normal cytology samples were HPV 53, 68, 70, 52, and 58, while HPV 16, 52, 58, 33, and 31 were prevalent in high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). In atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), the prevalence of HR-HPV varied with age; it was highest in those aged <30 yr, declining to a minimum at age 50-59 yr, and then increasing in older women (P<0.05).
3::A total of 30 patients with LAPC were enrolled. The median survival and progression-free survival were 21.3 and 12.7 months, respectively. Overall survival rates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 73.3, 36.7, 23.3, and 16.7%, respectively. The median survival of 23 patients who received CRT was 22.9 months, with a 3-year survival rate of 30.4%. The two most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events during induction GS were neutropenia (63.3%) and biliary tract infection (20%). Toxicities during CRT or maintenance chemotherapy were generally mild.
3::Oleandrin significantly decreased cell viabilities in SW480, HCT116 and RKO cells. The IC50 for SW480 cells was 0.02 µM, whereas for NCM460 cells 0.56 µM. More interestingly, the results of flow cytometry showed that oleandrin potently induced apoptosis in SW480 and RKO cells. Oleandrin downregulated protein expression of pro-caspase-3, -9, but enhanced caspase-3, -9 activities. These effects were accompanied by upregulation of protein expression of cytochrome C and BAX, and downregulation of BCL-2 protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, oleandrin increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, but decreased GSH concentration in the cells.
3::The EEP polar fractions exhibited up to 90% protection against lipid peroxidation. The IC50 value for anti-glycation activity of EEP was between 16.5 and 19.2 μg/mL, close to aminoguanidine (IC50 = 7.7 μg/mL). The use of UHPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS allowed the identification of 12 bioactive phenols in the EEP and 24 volatile compounds, all already reported.
3::Twenty-five of the 263 isolates (9.5%) showed resistance to fosfomycin, and 18 (6.8%) were positive for fosA3. None of the isolates was positive for fosA or fosC2. Seventeen of the isolates carrying fosA3 (94%) were CTX-M producers (seven CTX-M-55, five CTX-M-14, and five CTX-M-123), while three (16.7%) were TEM producers (TEM-1).Sixteen (88.9%) fosA3-carrying isolates exhibited multi-drug resistance. The replicon types of the 13 fosA3-carrying plasmids were IncF (n=13), IncHI2 (n=3), IncIl-Ir (n=2), and IncN (n=1).
3::We enrolled 365 patients with IS and 32 with TIA. α-galactosidase-A sequencing identified a single carrier of a genetic variant of unknown significance (p.R118C) and no well-recognized pathogenic variants. Mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 3.1. Proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 2 was 70.7% at ≤7 days and 87.4% at 6 months. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at presentation and diabetes mellitus predicted 6-month modified Rankin Scale. Thirteen patients experienced 5 recurrent IS and 9 TIA during follow-up. No patient died. Most patients (98.7%) returned home. Among previous workers, 43% had residual working limitations.
3::Psychostimulants were associated with statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms in major depressive disorder (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.78; P = 0.003) and bipolar disorder (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.13-1.78; P = 0.003). Efficacy outcomes differed across the psychostimulants evaluated as a function of response rates: ar/modafinil (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.20-1.81; P = 0.0002); dextroamphetamine (OR, 7.11; 95% CI, 1.09-46.44; P = 0.04); lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.94-1.56; P = ns); methylphenidate (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.88-2.54; P = ns). Efficacy outcomes also differed between agents used as adjunctive therapy (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.19-1.64) or monotherapy (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 0.67-7.52).
3::Before the diagnosis of ICH, 65.8% patients were not on APT, 29.5% patients were on SAPT, and 4.8% patients were on CAPT. There was an overall modest increased in-hospital mortality in the APT group versus no APT group (24% versus 23%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.10). Although patients on SAPT and CAPT were older and had higher risk profiles in terms of comorbidities, there was no significant difference in the in-hospital mortality among patients on SAPT versus those not on any APT (23% versus 23%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.05). However, in-hospital mortality was higher among those on CAPT versus those not on APT (30% versus 23%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-1.63).
3::Seventy-eight strains were identified as resistant to at least one carbapenem; these CRKP strains had a high prevalence rate (38.5%, 30/78) of carbapenemase producers. Additionally, most isolates harbored MDR genes, including Extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC, and quinolone and aminoglycoside resistance genes. Loss of porin genes was observed, and Class 1 integron was detected in 66.7% of the investigated isolates. PFGE and MLST results excluded the occurrence of clonal dissemination among these isolates.
3::Monofilament and neurothesiometer readings were measured in 1981 patients, mean age 57.4±10.8 years old. DPN prevalence was 10.8% (n=214). Patients with DPN compared to those without, were significantly older (p<0.0001), with longer duration of T2D (p<0.0001), had higher BMI (p=0.006), higher glucose (p=0.015) and HbA1c (p<0.0001), Systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p<0.0001), lower eGFR (p<0.0001), higher urine ACR (p<0.0001), poorer endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation (both p<0.0001), higher VCAM-1 (p<0.0001) and higher apoC-III [285.3 (195.2-405.6) vs 242.9(165.0-344.0) μg/ml]. After adjustment, log transformed apoC-III, remained independently associated with the presence of DPN (B=0.965, SE=0.397, p=0.015).
3::Of the 93 patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer, 35 patients (37.6%) were subsequently classified as having resectable disease following CRT. The median overall survival of patients who received CRT alone for locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer was 8.0 months, and all died within 3 years. On the other hand, the overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates in patients who were reclassified as having resectable tumour after CRT were 71.3%, 39.2% and 23.5%, respectively. Our pathological assessments after surgical resection suggested that CRT might be associated with a significant reduction in the risk of lymph node metastases in patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer.
3::The CAMISS-TLIF group had significantly less blood loss, postoperative drain, need for transfusion, and initial postoperative back pain; earlier rehabilitation; and shorter postoperative hospitalization than the open TLIF group, whereas CAMISS-TLIF took longer surgical time than open TLIF. However, no significant differences between the 2 groups in visual analog scale scores and Oswestry disability index were observed at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. A total of 93.33% and 73.39% of screws in the CAMISS and open groups, respectively, had no pedicle perforation (P=0.016), and the fusion rate was similar in both groups (P=0.787).
3::Higher vegetable nitrate intake was associated with a lower maximum CCA-IMT (B=-0.015, P=0.002) and lower mean CCA-IMT (B=-0.012, P=0.006). This relationship remained significant after adjustment for lifestyle and cardiovascular risk factors (P≤0.01). Vegetable nitrate intake was not a predictor of plaque severity. In total 186 (15%) women experienced an ischemic cerebrovascular disease event. For every 1 SD (29 mg/d) higher intake of vegetable nitrate, there was an associated 17% lower risk of 14.5-year ischemic cerebrovascular disease events in both unadjusted and fully adjusted models (P=0.02).
3::This study demonstrated an association between glucose metabolism parameters and triglycerides with OSAS severity underlying the complexity of the process leading to cardiovascular/metabolic complications in this disorder. Moreover, homocysteine, glycemic and lipidic profiles changed significantly after 6 months of PAP therapy in OSAS, supporting its cardiovascular and metabolic protective effect.
3::The initial average pullout force (6.5-mm screw) was 837 N (±329 N) and 642 N (±318 N) in L2-L3 and L4-L5 left pedicles, and 705 N (±451 N) and 779 N (±378 N) in L2-L3 and L4-L5 right pedicles, respectively. Comparison of revision pullout forces versus initial pullout forces revealed the following: 87% and 63% for AS in L2-L3 and L4-L5 left pedicles, respectively; 56% for 7.5-mm and 93% for 8.5-mm TPS in L2-L3 and L4-L5 right pedicles, respectively.
3::In 6 years, 361 lesions from 356 patients were treated (3 fractions: 297; 5 fractions: 64). The median follow-up was 16 months. 23 patients (6.5%) developed CW toxicity after a median time of 10 months following treatment. The mean CW V30/V37 was 21 cm(3) for patients with CW toxicity and 17 cm(3) for patients without toxicity (p < 0.05). The 2-year local control and the CW toxicity rates were similar, whether patients received three or five fractions (97% vs 96% and 7% vs 5%).
3::Postoperative CT images between 18 symptomatic and 13 asymptomatic patients were compared. On axial views, the symptomatic patients demonstrated greater areas of bone growth at the disk level (164.0±92.4 vs. 77.0±104.9 mm), and lateral recess (69.6±70.5 and 5.9±12.5 mm) as well as in the total cross-sectional area (290.3±162.1 vs. 119.4±115.6 mm). On sagittal imaging, the mean bone growth at the subarticular level (148.7±185.1 vs. 35.8±37.4 mm) and the total cross-sectional area (298.4±324.4 vs. 85.8±76.3 mm) were greater in symptomatic patients (P<0.01). Amount of BMP utilized and operative levels were no different between cohorts.
3::The Siremobil Iso-C 3D requires 128 seconds for its 190-degree scanning arc with equidistant isocenter. The Vision FD Vario 3D performs an elliptical scanning arc and completes its 135-degree scan in 64 seconds; furthermore, it features a flat panel detector and fully digital imaging. The smaller dimensions of the Vision FD Vario 3D made it easier to maneuver in the operating room compared with the more bulky Siremobil Iso-C 3D. With respect to image quality in cervical 3D scans, the Siremobil Iso-C 3D reached significantly higher scores in all categories. The Vision FD Vario 3D revealed less artifacts in lumbar 3D scans.
3::CBCT data revealed 0.79 ± 0.73 mm ridge width reduction from grafting to implant placement. Histomorphometric analysis of core biopsy samples revealed in average 21.34 ± 9.14% of new bone in the grafted sites. Primary implant stability was high (ISQ levels 70.3 ± 9.6) and further increased until final restoration.
3::Random-effects meta-analysis indicated a decrease in circulatory (SMD=-0.44), erythrocellular (SMD=-0.52) and CSF (SMD=-0.14) selenium levels in AD patients compared to controls. Stratified meta-analysis demonstrated that the selenium levels were decreased in both the subgroups with (SMD=-0.55) and without (SMD=-0.37) age matching between AD and controls. Our results also demonstrated a direct association between decreased selenium levels and GPx in AD.
3::For all the sagittal parameters, SVA, PI, SS, and LL in retrolisthesis group were found to be significantly lower than those in the anterolisthesis group and in the control group, respectively (P<0.05), whereas TLK in retrolisthesis group was significantly larger than other 2 groups (P<0.01). In addition, the average Pfirrmann disk score was 2.11 at levels with retrolisthesis indicating that the disks were not severely degenerated.
3::Forty (30 women, age 36±11 y) participants completed the study, 33 with LBP (13 MT, 13 sham ultrasound treatment, and 7 no treatment) and 7 without LBP. Participants with or without LBP could not be differentiated on the basis of serum cytokine levels, PPT, or MDT (P≥0.08). There were no significant differences between the groups at 1 hour or 24 hours on serum cytokines, PPT, or MDT (P≥0.07). There was a significant decrease from baseline in IL-6 for the no treatment (LBP) group (P=0.04), in C-reactive protein for the sham ultrasound treatment group (P=0.03), in MDT for all 3 LBP groups (P≤0.02), and in self-reported pain for the MT and sham ultrasound treatment groups (P=0.03 and 0.01).
3::Cases diagnosed with atypical autism were statistically significantly more likely to have received greater overall and dose-dependent exposures to Hg from TM-HepB vaccines administered within the first month of life, first two months of life, and first six months of life than the controls. Similar phenomena were observed when cases and controls were separated by gender.
3::We found no statistically significant difference between the control group and the study group concerning ISV (P=0.6808) and ISH (P=0.8981) 6 months after surgery. No statistically significant differences were found between ODI, VAS back, and VAS legs after 6 months between the 2 groups, however, there were statistically significant differences between these parameters in different time periods. Correlation between the volume of disc tissue removed and preoperative versus postoperative difference in ISV was statistically significant (P=0.0020).
3::Serum bio-intact PTH concentrations were strongly correlated but significantly lower than the intact PTH concentrations (r=0.963, P<0.0001). This finding was consistent among CKD stages 3 to 5. PTH concentrations by both assays (intact and bio-intact PTH) positively correlated with urea (r=0.523, r=0.504; P=0.002, respectively), phosphorus (r=0.532, r=0.521; P<0.0001, respectively) and negatively correlated with blood calcium (r=-0.435, r=-0.476; P<0.0001, respectively), 25(OH) vitamin D, (r=-0.319, r=-0.353; respectively, P<0.0001) and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (r=-0.717, r=-0.688; P<0.0001, respectively).
3::Pathogenic variants of the LMNA gene were determined in nine families. Of those, typical exon 8 codon 482 pathogenic variants were identified in four families. Analysis of the LMNA gene also revealed exon 1 codon 47, exon 5 codon 306, exon 6 codon 349, exon 9 codon 528, and exon 11 codon 582 pathogenic variants. Analysis of the PPARG gene revealed exon 3 p.Y151C pathogenic variant in two families and exon 7 p.H477L pathogenic variant in one family. A non-pathogenic exon 5 p.R215Q variant of the LMNB2 gene was detected in another family. Five other families harbored no mutation in any of the genes sequenced. MRI studies showed slightly different fat distribution patterns among subjects with different point mutations, though it was strikingly different in subjects with LMNA p.R349W pathogenic variant. Subjects with pathogenic variants of the PPARG gene were associated with less prominent fat loss and relatively higher levels of leptin compared to those with pathogenic variants in the LMNA gene. Various metabolic abnormalities associated with insulin resistance were detected in all subjects. End-organ complications were observed.
3::Two hundred ninety-three patients were included for review. Patients with OTA 41-C fractures were more likely to have an associated TE compared with 41-B fractures (63% vs. 28%, P < 0.01). At 3 months postoperatively, the +TE cohort was noted to have worse knee ROM (75.16 ± 51 vs. 86.82 ± 53 degree, P = 0.06). At 6 months, total SMFA and knee ROM was significantly worse in the +TE cohort (29 ± 17 vs. 21 ± 18, P ≤ 0.01; 115.6 ± 20 vs. 124.1 ± 15, P = 0.01). By 12 months postoperatively, only knee ROM remained significantly worse in the +TE cohort (118.7 ± 15 vs. 126.9 ± 13, P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that tibial eminence involvement was a significant predictor of ROM at 6 and 12 months and SFMA at 6 months. Body mass index was found to be a significant predictor of ROM and age was a significant predictor of total SMFA at all time points.
3::Graded balloon deflation resulted in variable initial return of aortic flow (median, 78 seconds; interquartile range [IQR], 68-105 seconds). A rapid increase in aortic flow during a single-balloon deflation step was observed in all animals (median, 819 mL/min; IQR, 664-1241 mL/min) and corresponded with an immediate decrease in proximal MAP (median, 30 mm Hg; IQR, 14.5-37 mm Hg). Total balloon volume and time to return of flow demonstrated no correlation (r = 0.016).
3::An iris biopsy showed an infiltrate of plasma cells. Immunohistochemistry for kappa and lambda light chains demonstrated lambda light chain restriction. Systemic hematologic investigations including complete blood count, serum paraproteins, bone marrow biopsy, and full-body magnetic resonance image were normal. The monoclonal plasma cell infiltrate was consistent with a solitary iris plasmacytoma. The mass was treated with ruthenium plaque radiotherapy. After 4 years of follow-up, the mass remained regressed, and no systemic myeloma has developed.
3::No statistically significant differences in any baseline demographic variables were found for either sex between the group taking immunomodulators/biologic agents and the nontreatment group. Among females and males, individual question responses, domain scores, and total scores showed no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment groups.
3::K-means clustering, which identified patterns of metabolite levels across ancestry groups, demonstrated that, at both fasting and 1-h, levels of the majority of metabolites were similar across ancestry groups. Meta-analyses demonstrated association of a broad array of fasting and 1-h metabolites, including lipids and amino acids and their metabolites, with maternal BMI, glucose levels, and insulin sensitivity before and after adjustment for the different phenotypes. At fasting and 1 h, a mix of metabolites was identified that were common across phenotypes or associated with only one or two phenotypes. Partial correlation estimates, which allowed comparison of the strength of association of different metabolites with maternal phenotypes, demonstrated that metabolites most strongly associated with different phenotypes included some that were common across as well as unique to each phenotype.
3::Carpolobia lutea exhibited concentration-dependent anti-AChE activity. The most potent inhibitory activity for the stem was the crude ethanol extract and hexane stem fraction oil (IC50 = 140 μg/mL); for the leaves, the chloroform leaf fraction (IC50 = 60 μg/mL); and for roots, the methanol, ethyl acetate and aqueous root fractions (IC50 = 0.3-3 μg/mL). Dose-dependent free radical scavenging activity and reducing power were observed with increasing stem, leaf or root concentration. Total phenolic contents were the highest in the stem: ∼632 mg gallic acid equivalents/g for a hexane stem fraction oil. Total flavonoid content was the highest in the leaves: ∼297 mg quercetin equivalents/g for a chloroform leaf fraction. At 1 μg/mL, only the crude ethanol extract oil was significantly cytotoxic to hepatocytes.
3::Overall, 26 studies were retrieved through the literature search. Ten studies including 720 patients met selection criteria. The use of fibrin-thrombin sealant patches to the sole scope of reducing lymphadenectomy-related complications significantly reduced the incidence of lymphocele, symptomatic lymphocele, the need of percutaneous drainage procedures, the volume of lymph drained, and the duration of the drainage. No effect on wound and/or lymphocele infection was noted.
3::All caregivers experienced feelings of different intensities of burden (52% mild-to-moderate, 43% moderate-to-severe and 5% severe), and none of them expressed little or no burden at the assessment moment. Caregivers main worries were ""dependence"" and ""the future of the injured."" Resilience was medium-to-high (mean = 141.93, SD = 23.44) for the whole sample with just a minority of them revealing low (15%) or very low resilience (7%). The highest scores were obtained in relation to ""caregivers' independence"" and ""meaning of their lives."" Life satisfaction scores were medium-to-high (mean = 36.6, SD = 6). These scores were not related to demographics or the severity of the injury. Zarit Burden Interview scores were negatively correlated to Resilience Scale ( r = -.370, P = .001) and Life Satisfaction Checklist scores ( r = -.412, P < .001).'
3::Seventy-one percent of the 87 sera had antibodies against one or more pathogens. ADV accounted for the highest seroprevalence (29%), followed by T. gondii (26%), L. interrogans (14%), M. bovis (12%), B. abortus (9%), N. caninum (3%), CPV (3%) and CDV (2%). Seroprevalence was influenced by location but not sex or age. Additionally, 16% of the seropositive samples for ADV had gammaglobulin levels >40.0 g/L. Antibody titers for CDV and CPV were low and difficult to interpret as almost all these cases had borderline concentrations.
3::Before propensity score matching, the single-site laparoscopic colectomy group had greater proportions of women and of patients with right-sided and early stage tumors compared with the conventional multiport laparoscopic colectomy group. After matching, the 2 groups each included 200 patients and did not significantly differ in any patient characteristics. The median follow-up period was 41.4 months. The 2 groups showed similar rates of intraoperative morbidity (p = 0.22) and postoperative complications (p = 0.87). Rates of 3-year disease-free and overall survival in single-site laparoscopic colectomy and conventional, multiport, laparoscopic colectomy groups were 95.5% and 91.3% (p = 0.44) and 100.0% and 98.7% (p = 0.24). The 3-year disease-free and overall survival rates in each stage did not significantly differ between the 2 groups.
3::The study showed no significant differences in all preoperative variables (P>0.05). While intraoperative blood loss and operative time in group 1 were increased compared to group 2, the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The height, relative depth and peripheral length of posterior wall respectively were 27.8±2.5mm (range: 24-35mm), 71.5±5.4% (range: 65-88%), 23.0±2.3mm (range: 17-28mm). The mean posterior wall fracture displacement is 5.0±3.2mm (range: 0-11mm). There was no difference regarding the quality of reduction between the two groups (P>0.05). The excellent to good clinical outcome was around 71.4% in the group 1 versus 73.4% in the group 2 at the final follow-up, this difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). There was no difference in rate of complications between the two groups (P>0.05).
3::A total of 11,955 patients were included, 6738 were males and 5217 were females. The mean age at dialysis initiation was 57.7 ± 16.1 years. The median follow-up time was 19.8 months. There were total 2555 deaths. The overall mortality rate was 8.2 per 100 patient-years. Mortality rates were 18.7, 7.5, 6.9, 6.9, 6.5 and 6.2 in each period. The first 2 months mortality rates were 41.9 and 16.6 per 100 patient-years. Higher mortality was observed in patients who were older, female, diabetic and hypertensive.
3::Of the 11,068 patients with rectal cancer, 56.2% had surgical resection alone, 21.7% received preoperative radiation, and 22.1% received postoperative radiation. The median follow-up for all of the groups of patients was >2 years. All of the groups of patients with rectal cancer were more likely to develop a urinary adverse event compared with control subjects. Adjusted HRs were 2.28 (95% CI, 2.02-2.57) for abdominoperineal resection alone, 2.24 (95% CI, 1.79-2.80) for preoperative radiation and surgical resection, 2.04 (95% CI, 1.70-2.44) for surgical resection and postoperative radiation, and 1.69 (95% CI, 1.52-1.89) for low anterior resection alone.
3::A total of 18,833 patients met inclusion criteria, with an overall rate of venous thromboembolism of 3.8. Among procedure risk groups, venous thromboembolism rates were high risk, 4.4%; intermediate risk, 1.6%; and low risk, 0.7% (across risk groups, p < 0.01). Emergent case subjects exhibited a higher rate of venous thromboembolism than their elective counterparts (6.9% vs 3.1%). Factors significantly associated with venous thromboembolism on adjusted analysis included emergent risk case (adjusted OR = 7.85), high-risk elective case (adjusted OR = 5.07), intermediate-risk elective case (adjusted OR = 2.69), steroid use (adjusted OR = 1.54), and preoperative albumin <3.5 g/dL (adjusted OR = 1.45).
3::Case records of 140 cats were reviewed; fixator-associated complications (FACs) occurred in 19% of cats. The region of ESF placement was significantly associated with complication development. Complications developed most frequently in the femur (50%), tarsus (35%) and radius/ulna (33%). Superficial pin tract infection (SPTI) and implant failure accounted for 45% and 41% of all FACs, respectively. SPTI occurred more frequently in the femur, humerus and tibia, with implant failure more frequent in the tarsus. No association between breed, age, sex, weight, fracture type (open vs closed), ESF classification, number of pins per bone segment, degree of fracture load sharing, and the incidence or type of FAC was identified. No association between region of placement, breed, age, sex, weight, fracture type (open vs closed), ESF classification, number of pins per bone segment, fracture load sharing and the time to complication development was identified.
3::Seven articles were identified. Different strategies were used by the authors to model the economic/public health impact of dairy products. The four studies assessing the public health impact of dairy products revealed a substantial benefit in terms of fracture prevented, life years, disability-adjusted life years and/or quality-adjusted life years gained. Studies assessing the cost-effectiveness revealed that the use of dairy products is generally cost-effective in the general population aged above 70 years, and from the age of 60 years in populations at high risk of fractures.
3::Substantial differences were seen in self-assessed health status between women with and without recurrence; 33.6% and 82.4% of women with and without recurrence rated their health as good to excellent, respectively. More patients with recurrence of disease reported limitations in moderate activity than those without. Furthermore, 79.0% of women without recurrence reported that pain did not affect or only slightly affected daily activities, compared with 28.2% with recurrence. Most women with recurrence (59.5%) reported that they were able to do less than they wanted to because of their emotional status compared with only 15.8% of women without recurrence. In addition, 66.4% of women with recurrence referred that they had problems concentrating at work and home versus 26.3% of women without recurrence.
3::The reported incidence of TD seems to be reduced with the use of atypical antipsychotic drugs, yet the risk of developing TD remains with these medications. Furthermore, several other medication classes have a high prevalence of TD and yet are not commonly considered to be TD-inducing. This review highlights the need for a prevention-based focus of TD treatment that starts with a clinical consideration of pharmacologic choices related to each individual patients history.'
3::Most of the 55 respondents from 8 countries perceived CR as important for outpatient care (mean ± SD = 4.83 ± 0.38 out of 5; higher scores indicating more positive perceptions), with benefits including reduced hospital readmissions (4.31 ± 0.48) and length of stay (4.64 ± 0.71 days), not only for cardiac patients but for those with other vascular conditions (4.34 ± 0.68 days). Those working in public institutions (50.9%) and in institutions without a CR program (25.0%) were not as aware of, and less likely to value, CR services (P < .05). Only 13.2% of programs had dedicated funding.
3::Patients consisted of a total of 134 program completers (72 males, 62 females; mean age = 67.8 years). Significant improvements in functional performance with regard to 6MWT scores were observed across all groups postintervention (P < .05). The Present group, in both the anxiety and depression domains, failed to reach a minimally clinically important difference postintervention. The Probable and Present groups achieved a significant improvement in CAT scores postintervention (P < .05).
3::A total of 283 out of 389 (72.7%) critical care providers agreed to participate. The same team of physicians attended both ICU and SDU, and severe burnout was identified in 18.2% of them. Considering all others critical care providers of both units, we identified that overall 23.1% (95% CI 18.0-28.8%) presented severe burnout, and it did not differ between professional categories. The mean MDS-R rate for all ICU and SDU respondents was 111.5 and 104.5, respectively, p = 0.446. Many questions from MDS-R questionnaire were significantly associated with burnout, and those respondents with high MDS-R score (>100 points) were more likely to suffer from burnout (28.9 vs 14.4%, p = 0.010). After regression analysis, moral distress was independently associated with burnout (OR 2.4, CI 1.19-4.82, p = 0.014).
3::Of the 76 journals, 89.5% were classified as predatory journals and the remaining as journals involved in predatory practices.
3::A total of 463 patients were enrolled in the study, and the observed hospital mortality was 26.1% (121/463). The patients enrolled were divided into survivors and nonsurvivors. Age, SAPS 3 score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation Score II (APACHE II), and predicted mortality were significantly higher in nonsurvivors than survivors (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The AUC (95% confidence intervals [CI s]) for SAPS 3 score was 0.836 (0.796-0.876). The maximum of Youdens index, cutoff, sensitivity, and specificity of SAPS 3 score were 0.526%, 70.5 points, 66.9%, and 85.7%, respectively. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test for SAPS 3 demonstrated a Chi-square test score of 10.25, P = 0.33, SMR (95% CI) = 0.63 (0.52-0.76). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test for SAPS 3 (AUS) demonstrated a Chi-square test score of 9.55, P = 0.38, SMR (95% CI) = 0.68 (0.57-0.81). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted for biochemical variables that were probably correlated to prognosis. Eventually, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), albumin,lactate and free triiodothyronine (FT3) were selected as independent risk factors for predicting prognosis.'
3::In all patients with RH, no statistical differences were found in mortality, severe cardiovascular events rate, and changes in 24-h SBP and office SBP at 6 and 12 months. However, subgroup analyses showed significant differences between the RDN and control groups. In the subpopulations with baseline 24-h SBP ≥155 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa) and the infrequently changed medication, the use of RDN resulted in a significant reduction in 24-h SBP level at 6 months (P = 0.100 and P= 0.009, respectively). Subgrouping RCTs with a higher prevalent CHD in control showed that the control treatment was significantly better than RDN in office SBP reduction at 6 months (P < 0.001).
3::A total of 60 young female AMI (<7 days) patients were enrolled. From their CAG and intracoronary imaging results, the prevalence of SCAD in young female AMI population was 35% (21/60), the prevalence of coronary atherosclerostic heart disease was 65% (39/60). In the SCAD group, 43% (9/21) presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and the remainder presenting as STEMI. SCAD usually occurred in a single vessel (20/21, 95%), especially in left anterior descending artery (14/21, 67%). Eighteen patients (18/21, 86%) underwent conservative treatment, whereas the remaining three patients (3/21, 14%) underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. Regarding the angiographic results of SCAD lesions, intramural hematoma was discriminated in 95% (20/21), and Type I imaging was observed in 5% (1/21), Type II was observed in 67% (14/21), and Type III was 29% (6/21). The average stenosis in the group was 76.9% ± 20.6%, and the mean lesion length was 36.6 ± 8.6 mm.
3::Pathological analysis revealed that prostate cancer (PCa) was present in 45 and absent in 48 patients. In the whole group, there were 42 men with small prostate (TPV < 30 mL) and 51 with enlarged prostate (TPV ≥ 31 mL). The overall average tT level was 0.79 ± 0.66 ng/g, while the average tDHT level was 10.27 ± 7.15 ng/g. There were no differences in tT and tDHT level in prostates with and without PCa. However, tT and tDHT levels were significantly higher in larger, than in smaller prostates (tT: 1.05 ± 0.75 and 0.46 ± 0.29 ng/g, and tDHT: 15.0 ± 6.09 and 4.51 ± 2.75 ng/g, respectively). There were strong correlations between tT and TPV (r = 0.71), and tDHT and TPV (r = 0.74).
3::The P4HB group (n = 31) experienced shorter drain time (10.0 vs 14.3 d; P < 0.002), fewer complications (22.6% vs 40.5%; P < 0.046), and reherniation (6.5% vs 23.8%; P < 0.049) than the porcine cadaveric mesh group (n = 42). Multivariate analysis for infection identified: porcine cadaveric mesh odds ratio 2.82, length of stay odds ratio 1.11; complications: drinker odds ratio 6.52, porcine cadaveric mesh odds ratio 4.03, African American odds ratio 3.08, length of stay odds ratio 1.11; and hernia recurrence: porcine cadaveric mesh odds ratio 5.18, drinker odds ratio 3.62, African American odds ratio 0.24. Cost analysis identified that P4HB had a $7328.91 financial advantage in initial hospitalization and $2241.17 in the 90-day postdischarge global period resulting in $9570.07 per case advantage over porcine cadaveric mesh.
3::Forty-seven patients were reported in 27 studies. We found that GS has a nationwide distribution and that most cases (83%) have been described on the mainland of China. The initial clinical presentation is varied, ranging from symptoms related to the thymoma to infections resulting from immunodeficiency. Type AB (50%) is the most common histologic type of thymomas in Chinese GS patients according to the World Health Organization classification of thymomas. With respect to infection, sinopulmonary infection (74%) is the most common type, followed by skin infection (10%) and intestinal tract infection (10%). Diarrhea was presented in 36% of patients, and autoimmune manifestations were presented in 36% of patients.
3::Individuals with MCI performed worse on speed and accuracy measures of IADLs in comparison to cognitively normal peers and demonstrated significantly steeper rates of decline over three years in either speed or accuracy in all domains assessed.
3::Readable results were obtained from 235 strains by GenoType MTBDRplus assay. Compared to DST, the sensitivity of GenoType MTBDRplus assay to detect RFP, INH, and multidrug resistance was 97.7%, 69.9%, and 69.8%, respectively, whereas the specificity for detecting RFP, INH, and multidrug resistance was 66.7%, 69.2%, and 76.8%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the GenoType MTBDRsl assay were 90.9% and 95.2% for OFX, 77.8% and 99.5% for KM, 63.7% and 86.4% for EMB, respectively. Mutations in codon S531L of the rpoB gene and codon S315T1 of KatG gene were dominated in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) strains.
3::Case of 35-year-old III gravida/II para with previously normal ongoing twin bichorionic biamniotic pregnancy in week 35+0, which was admitted to secondary care delivery room for three days lasting ""flu like"" symptoms and the right upper quadrant pain. She was icteric, exhausted, but normotensive (120/75 mm Hg). Acute caesarean section was performed for suspected fetal hypoxia and HELLP syndrome. The laboratory exams confirmed coagulopathy and HELLP syndrome second class during the operation. Blood loss was 800 ml. Despite standard treatment of HELLP syndrome, the condition had developed to renal insufficiency, bilateral fluidothorax, alveolar pulmonary edema, encephalopathy and hypertension. In laboratory results dominates markers of coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with presence of schistocytes. Due to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome with hemolysis of unclear origin, patient was transferred to referral hospital on sixth postoperative day. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPEX) was promptly begun. Improvement of laboratory parameters occurred already after the first TPEX and after two days there was a significant improvement of neurological status. Nine TPEX procedures were performed. The treatment was terminated after platelet count reached 100×109/l. She was discharged from hospital 21 days after delivery. After exclusion of other clinical entities, the case was closed as postpartum thrombotic microangiopathic syndrome.
3::A 34-year-old female with true AVF aneurysm presented with hand steal syndrome confirmed by noninvasive studies. The patient underwent a successful vein aneurysmorrhaphy with a commercially available stapler device and duplex ultrasound flow-calibrated banding. At 1-year follow-up, she remains pain free and the fistula remains functional with no recurrence of venous aneurysmal degeneration.
3::RMSE was lowest in the following reconstruction conditions: SI of 100 and 3DGF of 13 mm for Brightview XCT, SI of 160 and 3DGF of 3 pixels for Discovery NM/CT, SI of 60 and 3DGF of 2 pixels for Infinia, and SI of 140 and 3DGF of 15 mm for Symbia. In pre-harmonized conditions, coefficient of variations (COVs) among the SPECT/CT systems were greater than 10% for all quantitative metrics in three of the spheres, SUVmax and SUVmean, in one of the spheres. In contrast, all metrics except SUVmax in the 17-mm sphere yielded less than 10% of COVs after harmonization.
3::Average age of the 106 patients (64 women and 42 men) was 68 ± 11 years. Postoperative best spectacle-corrected visual acuity was 0.19 ± 0.13 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution in the FE-DMEK group and 0.35 ± 0.48 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution in the M-DMEK group (P = 0.218). One day after surgery, there were no significant graft detachments in the FE-DMEK group, compared with 20% graft detachment rate in the M-DMEK group (P = 0.041). Rebubbling was performed in 17% of eyes in the M-DMEK group compared with none in the FE-DMEK group (P = 0.066). The mean endothelial cell count in the FE-DMEK and M-DMEK groups at 6 months after surgery were 2105 ± 285 cells per square millimeter (24% cells loss) and 1990 ± 600 cells per square millimeter (29% cells loss), respectively (P = 0.579).
3::According to MRI, seven plaques were vulnerable, 12 were nonvulnerable without neovascularity, and 12 were nonvulnerable with neovascularity (a precursor of vulnerability). The two parameters cumulated axial translation and the ratio of cumulated axial strain to cumulated axial translation could discriminate between nonvulnerable plaques and vulnerable plaques or determine the presence of neovascularity in nonvulnerable plaques (which was also possible with the mean shear strain parameter). All parameters differed between the non-vulnerable plaque group and the group that combined vulnerable plaques and plaques with neovascularity. The most discriminating parameter for the detection of vulnerable neovascularized plaques was the ratio of cumulated axial strain to cumulated axial translation (expressed as percentage per millimeter) (mean ratio, 39.30%/mm ± 12.80%/mm for nonvulnerable plaques without neovascularity vs 63.79%/mm ± 17.59%/mm for vulnerable plaques and nonvulnerable plaques with neovascularity, p = 0.002), giving an AUC value of 0.886.
3::Over a 3-week period, a total of 2585 consecutive ACS patients have been enrolled in 203 cardiac care units across Italy. Among these patients, 1755 underwent PCI (923 with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and 832 with non-ST-elevation ACS). In the catheterization laboratory, unfractioned heparin was the most used antithrombotic drug in both ST-elevation myocardial infarction (64.7%) and non-ST-elevation ACS (77.5%) undergoing PCI and, as aspirin, bivalirudin and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs) more frequently employed before or during PCI compared with the postprocedural period. Any crossover of heparin therapy occurred in 36.0% of cases, whereas switching from one P2Y12 inhibitor to another occurred in 3.7% of patients. Multivariable analysis yielded several independent predictors of GPIs and of bivalirudin use in the catheterization laboratory, mainly related to clinical presentation, PCI complexity and presence of complications during the procedure.
3::Based on the criteria described above we selected four cases out of 55 monochorionic pregnancies. One case of prenatally diagnosed spontaneous TAPS which fulfilled all the diagnostic criteria with typical angioarchitecture inclusive, one case of spontaneous TAPS diagnosed postnatally, a case of postlaser TAPS with a spontaneous resolution and one unusual case of feto-fetal haemorrhage which does not fully meet criteria of TAPS or aTTTS. All the pregnancies were delivered by caesarean section. All the anaemic neonates required blood transfusion postpartum and two of the polycythemic neonates needed partial exsanguination.
3::The rate of CRSWD in BD subjects was significantly higher than that in MDD subjects (33.7% vs 9.6%; P < 0.001). A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that comorbid CRSWD (OR = 3.35, 95% CI = 1.24 - 9.07; P = 0.018), two or more previous mood episodes within the past year (OR = 3.57, 95% CI = 1.10 - 11.63; P = 0.035), and antidepressant-related switch to mania/hypomania (OR = 10.01, 95% CI = 1.20 - 83.52; P = 0.033) were significantly associated with BD in patients with remitted mood disorders.
3::A total of 40,446 patients were analyzed: 13,219 (32.7%), 13,935 (34.5%), and 1572 (3.9%) in the no-preparation, mechanical bowel preparation alone, and oral antibiotic preparation alone groups, and 11,720 (29.0%) in the combined preparation group. After matching, 9800, 1461, and 8819 patients remained in the mechanical preparation, oral antibiotic preparation, and combined preparation groups for comparison with patients without preparation. On conditional logistic regression of matched patients, oral antibiotic preparation alone was protective of surgical site infection (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.87), anastomotic leak (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.34-0.97), ileus (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.59-0.98), and major morbidity (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.96), but not mortality (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.08-1.18), whereas a regimen of combined oral antibiotics and mechanical bowel preparation was protective for all 5 major outcomes. When directly compared with oral antibiotic preparation alone, the combined regimen was not associated with any difference in any of the 5 postoperative outcomes.
3::Between October 2012 and March 2016, a total of 3,949 women met inclusion criteria and were diagnosed with false labor, discharged, and returned to deliver, whereas 2,592 similar women were admitted in early labor. The mean interval from discharge to return was 4.9 days. Cesarean delivery rates were not different between the study groups-11% for both (P=.69), and the perinatal composite outcome rates were not significantly different between those sent home and those admitted-3.2% compared with 3.1% (P=.79). Women with more advanced cervical dilatation at discharge returned and delivered significantly earlier than those with less dilatation regardless of parity.
3::From age 2 to 16 years, the average widths of the SI joint and pubic symphysis decreased from 3.11 to 1.80 mm and 5.55 to 3.69 mm, respectively. The average widths of the 3 limbs of the triradiate cartilage also slightly decreased from age 2 until closure: ilioischial, iliopubic, and ischiopubic cartilages decreasing from 3.72 to 2.74 mm, 4.42 to 3.52 mm, and 3.08 to 2.97 mm, respectively.
3::From May 2013 to May 2016, of the 293 women with GDM who were randomized, 149 (51%) were tested four times a day and 144 (49%) were tested every other day. Between the two groups, there were no significant differences with regard to need for medical treatment, induction, gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, rate of preeclampsia, or shoulder dystocia. Birth weight was similar between both groups and the upper bound of the 90% confidence interval (CI) was less than 165 g, establishing noninferiority with a mean difference of -41 g (90% CI -137 to 54 g). Rate of compliance with blood glucose testing was higher in the every-other-day group (89% compared with 92%, P<.01). The differences in rates of macrosomia and birth weight greater than the 95th percentile were not clinically significant. Neonatal outcomes including neonatal hypoglycemia were similar.
3::(18)F-florbetaben PET showed lower uptake in the white matter lesion visualized in the CT and MRI images. Decreased tracer uptake was also observed in a larger area of the left hemisphere beyond the lesions observed on MRI or CT. White matter lesion volume on FLAIR was 44.2mL, and tracer uptake change between damaged white matter and normal appearing white matter was - 40.5%. Standardized uptake value was inferior in the pseudotumoral lesion than in the other white matter lesions.
3::15 females and 13 males were included, 20 with GPW and 8 with CCS. The mean age was 50.1 ± 12.7 years, and the evolution time was 69 ± 49.6 months. We didnt find cases of MAP. 23 patients (82.1%) had general symptoms. The initial and final BVAS means were 10.5 and 1.5 (p < 0.001) and the global VDI was 2.4.'
3::A total of 142 (77 upregulated and 65 downregulated) transcripts were found to exhibit statistically significant difference between the HIF-1α-KO and WT mice. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that DEGs included genes involved in ""skeletal muscle cell differentiation,"" ""muscle organ development,"" ""glucose metabolic process,"" ""glycogen biosynthetic and metabolic process,"" etc.
3::Median age of multiple sclerosis onset corresponded to late onset multiple sclerosis. No association with multiple sclerosis was observed for truncal vagotomy (0-37 year adjusted HR=0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.48-1.74) or super-selective vagotomy (0-37 year adjusted HR=1.28, 95% CI: 0.79-2.09) compared with the general population.
3::TXA reduced mean incidence of transfusion by 305 mL (P = 0.0005). There was a trend toward decreased transfusion rate in the TXA group (17% vs. 26%, P = 0.22). TXA was safe with no differences in adverse events at 30 and 90 days.
3::The area of calcified nodules in the LIPUS-treated group was significantly greater than in the control group. The expression of Wnt was significantly elevated by LIPUS exposure. Markers associated with endochondral ossification were increased in the LIPUS-treated group. When sclerostin was added to the culture media, calcified nodule formation and the expression of Wnt were inhibited in both the LIPUS-treated group and the control group.
3::Postoperative prevalence of any surgical pain, pain severity, and pain medication was not different between retropubic and transobturator slings. Retropubic sling was associated with greater prevalence of suprapubic pain at 2 weeks (proportion difference 10.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.6-16.4%; P<.001). Transobturator sling was associated with greater prevalence of groin pain at 2 weeks (proportion difference 12.0%; 95% CI 7.1-16.8%; P<.001). There was no difference in pain resolution (odds ratio [OR] 1.11, 95% CI 0.88-1.40; P=.38). Between types of transobturator slings, the odds of surgical pain were similar at 2 (OR 2.39, 95% CI 0.51-11.31; P=.27) and 6 weeks (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.02-9.20; P=.61).
3::In group L, the lateral hinge formed a union at 3 months postoperatively in 11 knees (84.6%). At 6 months, gap filling in 10 knees (76.9%) reached to zone 2. In group C, while the lateral hinge formed a union at 3 months postoperatively in all cases. At 6 months, gap filling in 6 knees (46.1%) reached to zone 2. The progression of gap filling were 8.5%, 18.9%, and 32.9% (at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery, respectively) in group L, while the progress levels at the same time points were 7.7%, 16.6%, and 24.4% in group C. There were significant differences at 6 months after surgery between the 2 groups.
3::The duration of use was longer in the non-compliant group compared with that in the compliant group (mean ± SD: 160 ± 118 days vs. 126 ± 81 days; P = 0.01), and the mean age was younger in the non-compliant group (42 ± 20 years vs. 50 ± 21 years; P = 0.002). Additionally, there was a higher ratio of females/males in the compliant group (60/49 vs. 120/50; P = 0.008). However, the side of the fracture was not significantly different between the groups (P = 0.449). Fractures of the forearm were more frequent in the non-compliant group than that in the compliant group (25/170 vs. 7/109; P = 0.003).
3::The majority of patients were males, and average age at diagnosis was 37.5 years (range: 22-52 yrs). Two patients presented full clinical triad at onset, while the remaining developed visual and/or auditory disturbances later during the course of disease. All cases manifested varied neurological symptoms including pyramidal and/or sensory tract symptoms, amnesic disorders, ataxia and vertigo. Psychiatric manifestations such as disinhibition, aggressive behavior, paranoid ideation and hallucinations were also present. Seven patients suffered at least one relapse. Typical central corpus callosum fiber ischemias/infarcts, also known as snowball lesions were visible in all patients. Spokes, icicles, periventricular lesions and internal capsule ""string of beads"" patterns were observed on diffusion weighted images. Four cases presented fornix microischemias/microinfarctions, 5 juxtacortical involvement and 3 infratentorial infarcts. Leptomeningeal involvement was evident in only 1 patient after rabies vaccination. Fluorescein angiography was abnormal in 7 cases. Tonal audiometry revealed unilateral hypoacusia in 5 patients, 3 with low frequency hearing loss. Immunosuppressive treatment was indicated in all cases. Patient follow up ranged between 6 months and 9 years, only 1 patient was lost to follow up after three years.
3::The risk factors associated with a preterm labor were placenta praevia: OR = 10.2 (p = 0.005); previous preterm delivery: OR = 10.2 (p = 0.005); preeclampsia: OR = 6.38 (p = 0.00); twin pregnancy: OR = 5.8 (p = 0.000); oligohydramnios: OR = 5.8 (p = 0.000); tobacco use: OR = 4.6 (p = 0.002); premature rupture of membranes (PROM): OR = 4.1 (p = 0.000); cervicovaginitis: OR = 3 (p = 0.000); urinary tract infections (UTI): OR = 1.5 (p = 0.010).
3::The responsive and non-responsive groups consisted of 12 and 5 patients, respectively, and included only male patients. The average age was 13 and 16 years old in the responsive and non-responsive groups, respectively. Epiphyseal closure was present in 1 of the 12 patients in the responsive group and 3 of the 5 patients in the non-responsive group. The Saupe classifications in the responsive and in the non-responsive groups, respectively, were type I in 1 and 2 patients (3 total), type II in 6 and 1 patients (7 total), and type III in 4 and 3 patients (7 total). Bone union was achieved in 10 patients in the responsive group, whereas no patient achieved bone union and 3 patients underwent excision in the non-responsive group. Conservative treatment in the responsive and non-responsive groups, respectively, included prohibition of exercise for 7 and 2 patients (9 total) and instruction on quadriceps femoris muscle stretch for 5 and 2 patients (7 total). In addition, all of the 8 patients wearing an orthosis and 2 patients treated with LIPUS were in the responsive group.
3::The average age of the patients was 7 years (range 1-13 years). Seventeen were males and 13 were females. The Torode and Zieg classification included 3 type I, 6 type II, 13 type III, and 8 type IV. The Kappa value for interobserver agreement comparing radiographs was 0.453, and for CT was 0.42. Three patients (10%) were treated with a spica cast, and none required surgery for their pelvic fracture. Four patients (11%) demonstrated liver, spleen, or kidney injuries on CT. Out of those 4, 1 had indications for laparotomy and drain placement, 1 died secondary to shock, and 2 were treated conservatively.
3::All sway parameters of pwMS of Classes 2 and 3, as well as total TUG duration and time necessary to perform 180° turns, were found significantly higher than HC and Class 1 participants. However, poor correlations were found between sway and TUG parameters. When pwMS are grouped, small/moderate correlations (in the range 0.20-0.41) were found between all sway parameters and total TUG duration.
3::Prolonged, significant sox9 overexpression via rAAV was achieved in the aspirates for at least 28 days when applying the rAAV-FLAG-hsox9 construct, leading to higher, prolonged levels of matrix biosynthesis and to enhanced chondrogenic activities relative to control treatments especially when maintaining the samples under mechanical stimulation. Administration of sox9 however did not impact the indices of proliferation in the aspirates. Remarkably, sox9 gene transfer also durably delayed hypertrophic and osteogenic differentiation in the samples regardless of the conditions of culture applied versus control treatments.
3::Of 251 eligible patients, 246 (98%) agreed to participate. Complete follow-up data were available for 179 (71% of eligible). Most women (83%) used opioids after discharge for a median of 8 days (interquartile range 6-13 days). Of women who filled their prescriptions (165 [92%]), 75% had unused tablets (median per person 75 morphine milligram equivalents, interquartile range 0-187, maximum 630) and the majority (63%) stored tablets in an unlocked location. This amounts to an equivalent of 2,540 unused 5-mg oxycodone tablets over our study period. Women who used all prescribed opioids (n=40 [22%]) were more likely to report that they received too few tablets than women who used some (n=109 [61%]) or none (n=30 [17%]) of the prescribed opioids (33% compared with 4% compared with 5%, P<.001). The top quartile was more likely to be smokers than average users and consumed more opioid morphine milligram equivalents per hour of inpatient stay than average opioid users (1.6, interquartile range 1.1-2.3 compared with 1.0, interquartile range 0.5-1.4, P<.001).
3::The mean number of affected PVs per patient was 2.7 ± 1.1. Sutureless repair was used in 21 patients (70%), endovenectomy was used in 5 patients, and patch venoplasty was used in 4 patients. Overall PV restenosis, reoperation, and mortality occurred in 50%, 40%, and 30% of patients respectively. Freedom from mortality, reoperation, and restenosis at 8 years of follow-up was 70% ± 8%, 62% ± 8%, and 47% ± 9%, respectively. Restenosis and mortality rates after sutureless repair versus nonsutureless repair were 57% (n = 12 of 21) versus 33% (n = 3 of 9) (p = 0.42) for restenosis and 38% (n = 8 of 21) versus 11% (n = 1 of 9) (p = 0.21) for mortality. Patients selected for a sutureless technique were younger and smaller and had more severe disease before operation. A postoperative high PVS score and pulmonary hypertension 1 month after the operation were independent risk factors for restenosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.34; p = 0.002 and HR, 6.81; p = 0.02, respectively), reoperation (HR, 1.24; p = 0.01 and HR, 7.60; p = 0.02), and mortality (HR, 1.39; p = 0.01 and HR, 39.5; p = 0.008).
3::No differences between the baseline group and the exposed group (RFR) were observed. NMDA-NR1 expression decreased after CFA injection and RFR exposure, and an elevated expression of NMDA-NR1 was observed in healthy control rats of both groups: TRAM/RFR and RFR.
3::For those readmitted within 0 to 30 days, reasons for readmission were other medical conditions (62.5%), recurrent stroke (30.4%), and elective procedure (7.1%). For those readmitted within 31 to 90 days, reasons for readmission were other medical conditions (62.3%), recurrent stroke (15.1%), and elective procedure (22.6%). There was no significant relationship between being evaluated within 21 days and readmission at 0 to 30 or 31 to 90 days. However, those who did have a neurology follow-up at any point in time had a lower readmission rate of 10.6% compared to those who never came back (19.2%, P = .017). Patients with coronary artery disease and diabetes had a significantly higher likelihood of readmission within 0 to 30 days.
3::From June to August 2015, a total of 100 women were randomized: 50 to early and 50 to conventional postpartum etonogestrel insertion. Sociodemographic characteristics were similar between the groups, except for educational attainment. The conventional insertion group included a higher proportion of women with 8 or more years of formal education than the early insertion group (88% [44/50] compared with 70% [35/50], P=.02). There was no difference in infant weight at 360 days between the groups (early [mean±standard deviation] 10.1±1.2 kg compared with conventional 9.8±1.3 kg, mean difference estimate 0.3 kg, 95% confidence interval 0-0.7 kg). Growth curves, height, and head and arm circumferences did not differ between the groups.
3::miR-155 deficiency ameliorated liver IR injury, and inhibition of KCs by GdCl3 abolished this protective effect. miR-155 deficiency decreased CD80, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex class II expression in KCs after IR and tipped the M1/M2 balance toward an anti-inflammatory profile, where proinflammatory cytokine secretion was suppressed and IL-10 was enhanced. In addition, hepatocyte apoptosis was reduced in coculture with miR-155-deficient KCs in vitro.
3::There were 565 patients with ischemic stroke included in the analysis. The median ADL/IADL score was 2.32 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.41-3.41). The median opportunity score was 1 (IQR: 0.8-1), and 58.4% of the patients received defect-free care. After adjustment, the opportunity score (P = .67) and defect-free care (P = .92) were not associated with functional outcome.
3::The male:female ratio was 2.7:1. Mean age at diagnosis was 48 years (± 12). Main symptoms were cough (87.6%), expectoration (40%), blood-stained sputum (37.2%), fever (26.9%), chest pain (24.8%) and haemoptysis (16.6%). Eighty-eight (60.7%) patients had no underlying disease. Only five patients received a correct initial diagnosis; 60 patients were misdiagnosed with lung cancer, followed by pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and lung abscess. Most patients were diagnosed using surgical resection, transthoracic needle aspiration or flexible bronchoscopy. Sixty-seven patients received penicillin G, and one patient did not receive any antibiotics after surgery. The mean duration of treatment with antibiotics was 4.5 months (±3.7). Overall, 110 (75.9%) patients were fully cured, 4 died, 1 was lost to follow-up, and a record of the prognosis was not available for 30 patients. Mean duration of follow-up was 26 months (± 32).
3::Of 538 women, 60 (11%) had household food insecurity, 47 (78%) of which were moderate or severe food insecure. After mitogen stimulation, moderate or severe food insecure women had a median IFN-γ concentration of 4.2 IU/ml (IQR 2.2-9.8) vs. 8.4 IU/ml (IQR 3.0-10) in women with no or mild food insecurity (P = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, higher IFN-γ concentrations were associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection (OR 1.3, 95%CI 0.51-2.1, P = 0.001), and inversely associated with moderate or severe food insecurity (OR -1.6, 95%CI -2.9 to -0.27, P = 0.02) and the number of adults in the household (OR -0.08, 95%CI -0.16 to -0.01, P = 0.03). There was no association between food insecurity and IFN-γ response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen.
3::SH conditions generated greater deficits than MH conditions, and these more severe effects hastened the termination of exposures (5 vs. 18 min mean duration, respectively). Workstation performance collapsed rapidly on SH exposure, with Mathematics and Auditory Monitoring tasks proving vulnerable to breakdown. In MH exposures, these tasks exhibited impaired accuracy (declining 11% and 9%, respectively) and speed, with declines in Auditory Monitoring lingering into recovery.
3::Standardised notification rates ranged from 4.41 to 76.44 notifications per 100 000 population. Forty-one high-risk and 156 low-risk municipalities were identified. There was no statistically significant association between TB notification rate and the EDI, but some of its variables, such as the proportion of manual workers and the percentage unemployed, were significantly and directly associated with TB notification, whereas the variable proportion of residents with low education level' showed an inverse relationship.'
3::All but one participant had a history of migration, and maps of migration ranges revealed wide geographic dispersal. Most described living and work conditions that could contribute to the spread of drug-resistant TB, including numerous contacts and crowded living quarters.
3::During the study period 1,176 episiotomies were performed in 16,441 vaginal deliveries (7.2%). In phase 2 (2,352 vaginal deliveries), there was a nonsignificant drop in the episiotomy rate with education alone (9.0-8.2%, P=.21). In phase 3 (4,379 vaginal deliveries), the episiotomy rate demonstrated an additional, significant drop to 5.9% (P<.001), but this reduction did not reach the new Leapfrog goal of 5%. In phase 4 (3,160 vaginal deliveries), the hospital episiotomy rate again dropped significantly from 5.9% to 4.37% (P=.007) and met the target rate of 5%. This reduction was sustained over a 12-month time period. During this same time period, the rate of operative vaginal delivery among vaginal births increased (4.5-5.4%, P=.003) and there was no significant change in the rates of third- and fourth-degree perineal laceration (3.8-3.3%, P=.19).
3::Six controls and nine exercisers completed the study. There was an overall effect of BR on our outcomes. Except Goldmann IOP (mean pre/post difference in controls and exercisers: -0.47 mmHg vs. +1.14 mmHg), the magnitude of changes from baseline was not significantly different between groups. There was a +1.38 mmHg and a +1.63 mmHg iCare IOP increase during BR in controls and exercisers, respectively. Spectralis OCT detected a +1.33 μm average cpRNFL thickness increase in both groups, and a +9.77 μm and a +6.65 μm peripapillary retinal thickening post-BR in controls and exercisers, respectively. Modified Amsler grid, red dot test, confrontational visual field, color vision, and stereoscopic fundus photography were unremarkable.
3::Mean age of donor and recipient was 33.7 and 33.9 years, respectively. 59.6% died due to trauma. Mean of years on dialysis was 3.7. 22.9% of patients had delayed graft function (DGF). Calculated 5-year probability of graft survival during transplantation time was 74.1%; 7 days after transplantation, 74.9%; and one year after transplantation, 76.4%. 5-year death censored graft survival was 64.9%. There were no differences between death-censored graft survival and calculated probabilities (Z-test), with a C-statistic value of 0.54 ± 0.6 (95%CI 0.42-0.65, p = 0.5) and 0.51 ± 0.6 (0.39-0.63, 95% CI, p = 0. 7) for transplant time and seven days after. C-statistic value 1-year after transplantation was 0.68 ± 0.8 (95%CI 0.52-0.84, p = 0.02).
3::The associations between earthquake exposure and major depression were explained largely by the experience of peri-traumatic stress during the earthquakes (β = 0.180, p < 0.01) and not by disruption distress following the earthquakes (β = 0.048, p = 0.47).
3::There were 64,612 ambulatory hysterectomies reported; 81.5% of surgeries were performed laparoscopically and 16% vaginally. If these numbers are extrapolated to national estimates, this represents 100,000-200,000 outpatient hysterectomies per year. The strongest driver of the laparoscopic, compared with vaginal, route of hysterectomy in this data set was presence of cancer (odds ratio 4.01 [3.19-5.05], P<.001). In addition to indication for surgery, patient characteristics such as age, race, income, location, and primary payer were associated with mode of hysterectomy. The laparoscopic surgeries were associated with shorter length of stay (mean stay 0.65 days, [99% confidence interval 0.65-0.66] compared with 0.79 days [0.78-0.81], adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.89 [0.86-0.92], P<.001) and higher mean charges ($24,227 [$24,053-24,402] versus $14,068 [$13,811-14,330], P<.001) compared with vaginal surgeries.
3::The probability that the female patient did not experience PPAE with the initial treatment was 87.91% with dienogest, 80.07% with danazol, 84.93% with medroxyprogesterone (injectable and oral) and 89.17% with gosereline. The probability that the female patient abandoned her initial treatment was 9% with dienogest, 12.07% with danazol, 9.6 and 6.75% with medroxyprogesterone injectable and oral, respectively, and 10.8 and 3.6% 3-monthly and monthly with gosereline.
3::The mean multiplicative Q score for CD63 and CD9 expression is higher in PTs (209 and 72) compared with ANTs (154 and 24) (P = 0.0041, P = 0.0018), respectively. The Mean Q score for CD63 and CD9 expression is higher in the malignant PTs (231 and 85) compared with ANTs (129 and 25) (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0124).
3::Parenting stress mediated the association between attachment and schizotypy, though parenting competence did not have a significant effect as a mediator in a parallel model. Childhood trauma was associated with attachment and schizotypy but did not correlate with the parenting variables.
3::Our results showed that NNT-AS1 expression in cervical cancer tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues the overexpression of NNT-AS1 was positively associated with advanced FIGO stage, lymph node metastasis, depth of cervical invasion and poorer overall survival. Function assays showed that NNT-AS1 inhibition could suppress cervical cancer cells proliferation and invasion ability in vitro as well as the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In vivo mice xenograft model revealed that silencing NNT-AS1 could reduce tumor growth in nude mice.
3::The in vivo study of young, growing mice showed that chronic MBP intake for 3 wk increased the plasma ghrelin concentration and bone mineral density of the hind limb tibia. In vitro studies using minced rat gastric mucosa tissues and primary murine isolated gastric mucosal cells revealed that MBP stimulated ghrelin release in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, MBP-induced ghrelin secretion was partly inhibited by adrenergic blockers.
3::The overall performance of HFD was similar to UC. In miRNA yield, both HFD and UC can meet the needs of further analysis. The level of miR-145 in UEVs was significantly increased in patients with PCa compared with the patients with BPH (P = 0.018). In addition, significant increase was observed in miR-145 levels when patients with Gleason score ≥8 tumors compared with Gleason score ≤7 (P = 0.020). Receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) revealed that miR-145 in UEVs combined with serum PSA could differentiate PCa from BPH better than PSA alone (AUC 0.863 and AUC 0.805, respectively). In serum EVs, four miRNAs were significantly higher in patients with PCa than with BPH.
3::Forty-nine participants completed the trial in each group. Supplementation was well tolerated. Forty-five URTIs were confirmed: 28 in the placebo group and 17 in the Wellmune group (odds ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-1.26; P = 0.149). There was a strong trend for Wellmune to decrease the number of symptom days (P = 0.067). Symptom severity did not differ significantly between groups. Compared with the placebo group, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated blood from participants in the Wellmune group showed an increase in interferon-γ concentration from baseline at day 45 (P = 0.016) and smaller decreases in monokine induced by interferon-γ concentration from baseline at days 45 and 90 (P = 0.032 and 0.046, respectively). No difference was seen in serum or nonstimulated blood cytokines and chemokines or in salivary immunoglobulin A.
3::From the qualitative analysis, two major categories (direct and indirect factors) for cancer risks emerged based on participant notions of cancer risk and cancer prevention behaviors as they relate to firefighting.
3::Among 3704 workers living in Washington State after 1991, when cancer registry case accrual began, 516 first primary diagnoses occurred through 2007. While overall cancer incidence was significantly reduced [SIR: 0.83 (0.76, 0.90)], internal comparisons suggest an association with exposure comparing high to low exposed person-time [SRR: 1.28 (1.05, 1.55)].
3::REEc1, REEc2, and REEc3 explained 54% (P < 0.001), 56% (P < 0.001), and 58% (P < 0.001) of REEm variance in all participants, respectively. However, REEc2 showed mean difference between REEm (P < 0.001), and REEc3 showed trends in estimating the REE (P < 0.05). In contrast, REEc1 showed limits of agreement (95%) of -248.3 to 285.8 kcal/d, 18.7 ± 136.3 kcal/d of bias, and no trends in the Bland-Altman analysis. The relationship between all predicted models and measured REE decreased in LW and LWH.
3::The percentage values of FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s), FVC (forced vital capacity) and MVV (maximal voluntary ventilation) showed significant improvement between the two examinations in the early adolescent period. In adulthood, FEV1%pred (percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s) showed no statistically significant difference. The mean values of both FVC and FVC%pred (percentage predicted forced vital capacity) for the preterm-born group were lower than for the reference group, but this was not statistically significant. The preterm-born group showed lower values of such parameters as forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of FVC, MEF25 (maximal expiratory flow at 25% of forced vital capacity) and FEV1/FVC as compared with the reference group, but again without statistical significance.
3::The results showed that DHM could inhibit the activity of CYP3A4, CYP2E1 and CYP2D6, with IC50 values of 14.75, 25.74 and 22.69 μM, respectively, but that other CYP isoforms were not affected. Enzyme kinetic studies showed that DHM was not only a non-competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 but also a competitive inhibitor of CYP2E1 and CYP2D6, with Ki values of 6.06, 9.24 and 10.52 μM, respectively. In addition, DHM is a time-dependent inhibitor for CYP3A4 with KI/Kinact value of 12.17/0.057 min(-1 )μM(-1).
3::NO generation and iNOS induction were increased in the LPS-activated mouse peritoneal macrophages. However, NO generation and iNOS induction by LPS were suppressed by treatment with OJ for the first time. The IC50 value of OJ with respect to NO production was 0.09 mg/mL. OJ did not influence LPS-stimulated COX-2 induction, but did significantly decrease LPS-stimulated secretions and mRNA expressions of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β. Inhibition rates of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β at an OJ concentration of 1 mg/mL were 77%, 88%, and 50%, respectively. OJ also suppressed the LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB. High-performance liquid chromatography showed schizandrin and gomisin A are major components of OJ.
3::Students who received brief individual CBT displayed a significant reduction in their homesickness and depression scores compared to the scores of students in the control group. Students who experienced only homesickness exhibited a significant reduction in the scores on homesickness in the post-assessment compared to the control groups post-assessment homesickness scores.'
3::We found a significant difference between men and women regarding the maximum height, maximum width, maximum A-P diameter of sinuses and the maximum distance between the right and left maxillary sinuses in all of our participants. We also found that the highest accuracy for sex determination was related to the maximum distance between the sinuses (65.6%) and the lowest to the maximum width of the right sinus (56.2%). The most accurate identification resulted from assessing the maximum distance between the sinuses in the 20-34 age group (74.3%), the maximum anterior-posterior diameter of the sinuses in the 35-49 age group (62.8%) and the maximum height of the left sinus in the over 50 age group (65.7%).
3::Among those with hypertension, the full implementation of the ACA (year 2014) is associated with a greater likelihood of being insured, but the race/ethnicity interaction indicates that this gain is less substantial for Mexican-heritage Latinos. The odds of having a usual source of care other than the emergency department increased after the passage of the ACA, and interaction effects indicate that this gain was more substantial for Mexican-heritage Latinos. The odds of having any physician visit and taking blood pressure mediations decreased among non-Latino whites but increased among Mexican-heritage Latinos.
3::Lower nadir PaO2 values were associated with postoperative stroke, with estimated odds of stroke increasing over 20% (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-1.41) per 10 mm Hg lower nadir PaO2, and similarly increased odds of stroke per lower quartile of nadir PaO2 (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.19-2.16). When average PaO2 was considered, odds of stroke was also increased (adjusted OR, 1.39 per lower quartile of mean PaO2; 95% CI, 1.05-1.83). Having a nadir PaO2 value in the lowest versus any other quartile was associated with an estimated 2.41-fold increased odds of stroke (95% CI, 1.22-4.78). Quartile of nadir but not average PaO2 results remained significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons.
3::Eighteen RCTs published between 1985 and 2013 involving 1143 patients were included. Dosage of ω-3 PUFAs used was 2.1 to 9.1 g/d, with study durations of 12 to 52 wk. Ten studies supported the hypothesis that there is a reduction in patient or physician assessment of pain associated with RA after intake of ω-3 PUFAs. Eight studies found no statistically significant effect of ω-3 PUFAs on arthritic pain.
3::SSB intake (100 g/d) was associated with higher BMI (β = 0.06 kg/m(2); P = 0.001) and WC (β = 0.19 cm; P < 0.001). A linear trend with BMI and WC also was seen when SSB intake was examined as categories of servings per day (Ptrend ≤ 0.001). Replacing SSB with water, coffee/tea, or milk was inversely associated with BMI (β = -0.07 to -0.09 kg/m(2); P < 0.001) and WC (β = -0.25 to -0.28 cm; P < 0.001).
3::According to the non-inferiority analysis and a pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -24%, the APPAC did not demonstrate non-inferiority of antibiotics vs. appendectomy. Significantly, however, the operations were nearly always open, whereas the majority of appendectomies in the United States are done laparoscopically; and laparoscopic and open appendectomies are not equivalent operations. Treatment with antibiotics is efficacious more than 70% of the time. However, a switch to an antimicrobial-only approach may result in a greater probability of antimicrobial-associated collateral damage, both to the host patient and to antibiotic susceptibility patterns. A surgery-only approach would result in a reduction in antibiotic exposure, a consideration in these days of focus on antimicrobial stewardship.
3::Seventy-five patients participated in this study, with a response rate of 88%. Self-reported questionnaires indicated that 31% and 11% of patients were identified as probable for having anxiety and depression, respectively. The level of agreement between the patient and gastroenterologist as to the presence of anxiety or depression was fair to moderate (kappa statistic 0.32 and 0.41, respectively). In only 50% of cases was further action taken by gastroenterologists during consultation for distressed patients, mostly in the form of a patient discussion.
3::Eleven participants completed all testing. An orthotic effect on gait was not evident on first use of FES. However, therapeutic effects on gait after 8 weeks use were generally positive, including increases in walking speed due to improved neuromuscular control and power generated at the hip and ankle of the more affected limb. The action of FES alone was not sufficient to overcome all fatigue related deficits in gait but there was evidence 8 weeks use of FES can ameliorate some fatigue effects on lower limb kinetics, including benefits to ankle mechanics involved in generating power around push-off during stance.
3::Overexpression of HER2/neu protein and a triple-negative immunoprofile and basal-like phenotype of cancer were more frequently seen in the women under 35 years of age. In addition, malignant cells were poorly differentiated and more aggressive, and prognostically favourable types were not often seen, in these women. In terms of the course of disease, the outcome was worse for the younger patients, and complete remission was reached less frequently and more cases of advanced disease and death due to the malignancy were detected.
3::The prevalence of low KIDMED score was significantly higher in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis compared with other groups; poor adherence to the MD correlated with liver damage, the NAFLD activity score >5, and grade 2 fibrosis. Moreover, in patients with poor adherence to the MD, higher values of C-reactive protein, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and homeostatic model assessment of β cell function were observed.
3::Key informants (n=23) noted that services for patients with gynecologic cancers are provided through a combination of VA and community care with wide variation in care arrangements by facility. Care coordination challenges included care fragmentation, lack of role clarity and care tracking, and difficulties associated with VA and community provider communication, patient communication, patient records exchange, and authorizations. Care coordination roles suggested for addressing challenges included: care tracker, provider point-of-contact, patient liaison, and records administrator.
3::In Study 1, a 15-item two-factor structure was identified. A 10-item two-factor structure was confirmed in Study 2. Results also indicated that the MSCRQ has acceptable levels of reliability, and good concurrent and incremental validity.
3::Rg1 significantly decreased the immobility time of mice in FST and TST. Furthermore, Rg1 alleviated anhedonia and hopelessness, decreased serum corticosterone level, and increased serum testosterone level, and the GR protein level in the PFC and hippocampus of the CUMS-treated rats. Moreover, Rg1 improved sleep disruption, down-regulated the serum corticosterone level, and increased AR protein level in the PFC of the GDX-treated mice.
3::The cardioprotective effect was observed in SND pretreatment groups, especially in low dosage SND group. The results of serum enzyme activities and histopathology were consistent with the above effect. Meanwhile, fifteen latent biomarker candidates were identified involving glucose, phospholipid, bile acid and amino acid metabolisms. Among them, five bile acids including ursodeoxycholic acid, murideoxycholic acid, muricholic acid, hyodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid, were for the first time identified as latent pathological biomarkers related to ISO-induced myocardial injury. Further, different dose SND groups exerted different of inhibition degrees to the activation of NF-κB, which was obvious in the SND-L group.
3:: (68)Ga-AGuIX@NODAGA was proven to passively accumulate in U87MG human glioblastoma tumor xenografts. Metabolite assessment in serum, urine and tumor samples showed that (68)Ga-AGuIX@NODAGA remains unmetabolized up to at least 60 min postinjection.
3::ARV use was 58% (319/548) in 2009, 67% (410/608) in 2012, and 71% (386/545) in 2015. In all 3 cycle years, a higher percentage of ARV treatment was observed among males, PWID of older age (≥50), and PWID with current health insurance. ARV use increased overall, with an adjusted relative increase of 8% per every 3-year increase in year (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval: 1.03 to 1.12). ARV use also increased among most subgroups.
3::Compared with controls, 5-FU reduced QoL, measured by the Skindex symptom, Skindex function and SCI social subscales (P < 0.001, P < 0.01, P = 0.02, respectively). At 1 month, significant changes in QoL in the 5-FU group were observed in the Skindex symptom (10.1, 95% CI 0.36-12.6), Skindex function (6.0, 95% CI 4.0-8.0) and SCI social (-3.5, 95% CI -6.2 to -0.8) subscales, while the other subscales of Skindex and SCI did not show significant changes. All three Skindex subscales at 1 month correlated with patient-reported symptom score and photograph-based toxicity score, whereas social subscale was the only one of the SCI subscales that correlated with patient-reported symptom and photograph-based toxicity scores.
3::The IC50 (concentration by which 50% cell growth was inhibited) was 20 μM for paclitaxel alone, 1.5 μg/mL for MAP2K6-FP alone, and 0.3 μg/mL for MAP2K6-FP and 15 μM for paclitaxel if combined, respectively. In addition, immunohistochemistry assay demonstrated that tumor tissues from ovarian cancer patients showed higher expression of LC-3, the autophagy-related protein, compared with normal ovarian tissues. MAP2K6-FP (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 μg/mL) dose-dependently increased the LC-3 expression in HO8910 cells. Immunofluorescence assay showed that paclitaxel alone increased the expression of LC-3 in HO8910 cells, which was further enhanced by the combination with MAP2K6-FP. Downregulation of LC-3 expression using LC-3 small interfering RNA inhibited the cytotoxicity effect of MAP2K6-FP. Furthermore, either MAP2K6-FP alone or in combination with paclitaxel increased the ratio of expressions of Beclin-1/Bcl-2, another autophagy-related markers, compared with paclitaxel alone.
3::We found one significant DMP (cg03559389, DIP2C) and 104 significant DMRs after multiple-testing correction. Of these, 34 DMRs mapped to genes differential expressed with respect to the same trait. Five of the genes were associated with more than two traits: CTU2, USP36, ZNF516, KLK10 and CPT1B.
3::We identified 10,988 citations, yielding 26 articles for further analysis; three studies with 267 patients were finally analyzed. Most patients (n = 135) were comatose due to head trauma. Systemic antibiotic administration was associated with decreased incidence of EO-VAP (RR 0.32; 95% CI 0.19-0.54) and shorter ICU LOS (standardized mean difference -0.32; 95% CI -0.56 to -0.08), but had no effect on mortality (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.7-1.53) or duration of mechanical ventilation (standardized mean difference -0.16; 95% CI -0.41 to 0.08).
3::Among 350 robotic-assisted hysterectomies for endometrial cancer, 187 (53%) underwent attempted sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. At least 1 SLN was detected in 185, a 99% overall detection rate; 108 (58%) also had non-SLNs removed. Among 91 patients with SLNs and non-SLNs from the ipsilateral hemipelvis, both were negative in 74 (81%) and positive in 7 (8%), and 10 (11%) had a positive SLN with negative non-SLNs. Among 17 patients with SLNs and non-SLNs from the contralateral hemipelvis, both were negative in 12 (71%), both were positive in 3 (18%), and 2 patients (12%) had negative SLNs with contralateral positive non-SLNs. Among 79 patients with only a SLN dissection, 4 (5%) were positive; among 69 patients with only a non-SLN dissection, 14 (20%) had positive lymph nodes. Among 24 patients with metastatic SLNs, 9 (38%) had isolated tumor cells, 3 (13%) had micrometastases, and 12 (50%) had macrometastases. Among the 40 total patients with metastatic lymph nodes, low-volume metastases represented the largest metastatic deposit in one third of patients, all of which had SLN dissection. All 12 with low-volume metastases had endometrioid histology compared with less than half (46%) of those with macrometastases (P < 0.01). Grade 1 carcinoma was present in 7 (58%) of the patients with low-volume metastases compared with 4 (14%) of those with macrometastases (P < 0.01) Furthermore, significantly more patients with low-volume metastases versus macrometastases had less than 50% myometrial invasion (67% vs 4%, P < 0.001).
3::There were no significant differences in outcome between patients with and without prior APT after adjustment for baseline characteristics and management factors during the first week; defined by mRS scores 2 to 6 (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-1.26; P=0.953), 3 to 6 (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.75-1.20; P=0.662), or ordinal mRS shift (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.87-1.21; P=0.770). Alteplase-treated patients on prior APT had higher symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.00-3.30; P=0.051) according to the safe implementation of thrombolysis in stroke-monitoring study definition. Although not significant (P-trend, 0.053), low-dose alteplase tended to have better outcomes than standard-dose alteplase in those on prior APT compared with those not using APT (mRS scores of 2-6; OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.62-1.12 versus OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.99-1.36).
3::One hundred forty-five (17.8%) surveys were collected. Significant differences were observed between tertiary hospitals and secondary or private hospitals in terms of appropriate (according to European Society of Gynaecologic Oncology guidelines) nodal staging in low-risk cases (96 [95%] vs 27 [61.4%], respectively; P < 0.001), appropriate nodal staging in intermediate-risk cases (96 [95%] vs 39 [88.6%], respectively; P = 0.004), appropriate treatment in advanced-stage cases (63 [67.7%] vs 13 [40.6%], respectively; P < 0.001), and surgical treatment of relapses (87 [93.5%] vs 18 [56.3%], respectively; P = 0.004) but nonsignificant in the rate of complete paraaortic lymphadenectomy performance (82 [81.2%] vs 28 [63.6%], respectively; P = 0.056). Similar results have been observed when comparing centers with less than 20 cases per year to centers with more than 40 cases annually, with significant differences in the management of low-risk and intermediate-risk endometrial cancers.
3::One hundred twenty-three participants were assigned to rhythm-and-music therapy (n=41), horse-riding therapy (n=41), or control (n=41). Post-intervention, the perception of stroke recovery (mean change from baseline on a scale ranging from 1 to 100) was higher among rhythm-and-music therapy (5.2 [95% confidence interval, 0.79-9.61]) and horse-riding therapy participants (9.8 [95% confidence interval, 6.00-13.66]), compared with controls (-0.5 [-3.20 to 2.28]); P=0.001 (1-way ANOVA). The improvements were sustained in both intervention groups 6 months later, and corresponding gains were observed for the secondary outcomes.
3::All PET/MR examinations had good or excellent image quality and were deemed clinically acceptable. There was substantial agreement of PET image quality among readers of PET/MR images. Per patient, PET/MR and PET/CT had complete concordance in identifying active disease. PET/MRI correctly classified 74 (96%) of 77 foci of disease identified on PET/CT. The per-lesion maximum SUVs were strongly correlated between modalities with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.73 (P < 0.001).
3::In cross-sectional analyses, decreased ABI was not significantly associated with RLS as outcome in multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for several potential confounders (BiDirect: odds ratio (OR) = 1.07 for a -0.1 change in ABI, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81-1.42, p = 0.62; SHIP-2: OR = 0.99, CI: 0.85-1.16, p = 0.94; SHIP-Trend: OR = 0.99, CI: 0.87-1.13, p = 0.88). Similar non-significant results were achieved using PAD (instead of ABI) as an independent variable. In BiDirect, baseline ABI was not a significant predictor of incident RLS in longitudinal analysis (OR = 0.77, CI: 0.53-1.12, p = 0.17).
3::A significant correlation was evident between SLH and COH (r=0.861, P=0.003) and SLH and TH (r=0.908, P=0.001). The correlational analyses of SEBT revealed a significant relationship between the posteromedial and posterolateral direction of the SEBT (r=0.943, P<0.001). SEBT and SLHT showed no correlation.
3::Most factorial parameters of the ISI remained invariant after CBT-I. However, the factorial model of the PSQI changed after CBT-I treatment. An extra loading with three residual correlations was added into the factorial model after treatment.
3::Thirty-five participants (64.8%) completed the entire study protocol (received a study medication and completed 14- and 45-day follow-ups). Among those who received a study medication (n = 45), 77.8% completed all follow-up interviews. This pilot study was not designed to have sufficient statistical power for hypothesis testing, and thus, as expected, there were no significant differences between groups in medication adherence (self-report of >80% of daily doses taken in oral group; receipt of second injection in the injection group), treatment engagement (at least treatment 3 visits in the 30 days postdischarge, and 2 or more visits per month in each of the 3 months following discharge) or alcohol consumption at 14 or at 45 days (p > 0.05). The median number of drinks among the entire cohort in the 2 weeks prior to hospitalization (128 drinks) was significantly higher than at day 14 (0 drinks, p < 0.001) or day 45 (0 drinks, p < 0.001). Rates of medication adherence were 62% in the oral group and 61% in the injection group.
3::Hippocampal atrophy was associated with higher Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores (r = -0.4, p = 0.0408) and higher arousal indices (r = -0.4, p = 0.0332). Local volume loss of the putamen was associated with higher arousal indices (r = -0.5, p = 0.0416). Atrophic change of subcortical structures including the hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, and thalamus, correlated negatively with verbal fluency, frontal function, verbal memory, and visual memory, respectively, in these patients (|r| ≥ 0.3, p < 0.05).
3::The mean age of the study population was 47.8 ± 10.8 years. Qatari women and Arab women constituted 64.7% and 35.3% of the study population, respectively. The mean 5-year and lifetime breast cancer risks were 1.12 ± 0.52 and 10.57 ± 3.1, respectively. Consanguineous marriage among parents was seen in 30.6% of participants. We found a relationship between the 5-year and lifetime risks of breast cancer and variables such as age, age at menarche, gravidity, parity, body mass index, family history of cancer, menopause age, occupation, and level of education. The linear regression analysis identified the predictors for breast cancer in women such as age, age at menarche, age of first birth, family history and age of menopausal were considered the strong predictors and significant contributing risk factors for breast cancer after adjusting for ethnicity, parity and other variables.
3::From a total of 202 patients submitted to pleurodesis (47% men; mean age 66.9±12.02 years). Lights criteria identified 86.6% as exudates. We found 85.1% survival at 30-day post-pleurodesis, which means the therapy used has significant success. A logistic regression model applied explained that variance in post-pleurodesis events was mostly due to age and gender rather than pleural biochemical factors (X(2)(5)=44.648, p<0.001, R(2) 28.3%).'
3::In Study 201, mean (standard deviation) changes in MWT sleep latency were 12.7 (10.6) min with JZP-110 versus 0.9 (6.0) min with placebo (P = 0.0002) for 40-min data, and 8.9 (6.3) versus 0.4 (4.6) min for 20-min censored data (P < 0.0001). In Study 202, mean changes in MWT sleep latency were 12.8 (10.3) min with JZP-110 versus 2.1 (7.9) min with placebo (P < 0.0001) for 40-min data, and 8.9 (5.5) versus 1.1 (5.6) min for 20-min censored data (P < 0.0001). In Studies 201 and 202, respectively, Cohens d effect sizes were large and numerically greater for 20-min censored data (1.54 and 1.41) versus 40-min data (1.37 and 1.17).'
3::A total of 26 respondents participated in the focus groups ( n = 21) or semi-structured interviews ( n = 5) and 10 caregiver staff completed cognitive interviews. Additional symptoms and problems included agitation, wandering, sleep problems, communication problems and diarrhoea. Refinements or lay terms were required to improve comprehension and consistency of item response for nausea, drowsiness, delusions/hallucinations, agitation, loss of interest, communication problems and interaction. A video presentation was required to support comprehension of instructions and assessment of verbally compromised residents.
3::Most frequent were patients expressions of treatment preferences (65% of consultations), often the simple wish to have treatment. Expressions of underlying values (48%) and appraisals of treatment aspects (50%) were less common. Most preference-related utterances concerned single statements (59%); in 51% of the consultations, true dialogue was observed. Preference-related utterances were least common in follow-up consultations concerning stable disease or response. Preference-related fragments were patient-initiated (42%), oncologist-facilitated (28%) or oncologist-invited (30%). Oncologist responses likely to trigger more preference-related talk were showing empathy, checking and probe questioning. Likely to reduce space were providing information, personally agreeing and neutral responses.'
3::Adults with IDD and HIV were more likely than those without HIV to have three types of mental health disorders: non-psychotic disorders [aRR: adjusted rate ratio (aRR): 1.22 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.47)], psychotic disorders [aRR: 1.57 (1.09, 2.28)] and substance use disorders [aRR: 3.52 (2.53, 4.91)]. Adults with IDD and HIV were also more likely to have emergency department visits [aRR: 1.68 (1.42, 1.98)] and hospital admissions [aRR: 2.55 (1.74, 3.73)] for any reason, and to have mental health emergency department visits and/or admissions [aRR: 2.82 (1.90, 4.18)].
3::Nanoparticles were stable and nontoxic. Upon administration in colitic mice, anti-MAdCAM-1 functionalized nanoparticles preferentially localized in the inflamed bowel, whereas untargeted nanoparticles were more rapidly washed out. Nanoparticles did not induce lesions in nontarget organs.
3::There were 720 (20.6%) patients in the statin treatment group. Dementia or cognitive impairment was an associated comorbid condition in 7.9% patients in the statin treatment group compared to 3.1% patients in the non-statin group (P < 0.001). Analysis of all of the patients with cognitive impairment or dementia showed that among the age ranges of 51 years through 100 years, the patients in the statin treatment group had a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment or dementia compared to the non-statin group. In the statin treatment group, we found significantly higher prevalence of hyperlipidemia (86.3%), hypertension (69.6%), diabetes mellitus (36.0%), osteoarthritis (31.5%), coronary artery disease (26.1%), hypothyroidism (21.5%) and depression (19.3%) compared to the non-statin group (P < 0.001). About 39.9% of the patients with dementia or cognitive impairment were on statin therapy compared to 18.9% patients who had no dementia or cognitive impairment and were on statin therapy (P < 0.001). Among the patients with cognitive deficit or dementia in the statin treatment group, the majority of the patients were either on atorvastatin (43.9%) or simvastatin (35.1%), followed by rosuvastatin (12.2%) and pravastatin (8.8%). We found greater odds of dementia or cognitive impairment with each year increase in age (1.3 times), in women (2.2 times), African American race (2.7 times), non-consumption of moderate amount of alcohol (two times), diabetes mellitus (1.6 times), hypothyroidism (1.7 times), cerebrovascular accident (3.2 times), and other rheumatological diseases (1.8 times).
3::There was no difference between the two groups regarding preoperative diagnosis, intraoperative surgical procedure performed, and length of hospital stay. The groups were compared in terms of postoperative pathological diagnosis using the Chi-square test, and there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Comparing the operation time and hematocrit change, there were statistically significant differences between the two groups. Both patient and observer PSOAS scar scores were better in MLS group (P < 0.05).
3::A total of 263 patients (mean age, 64.1 years) with 374 D-dimer measurements (median, 0.44 mcg/mL) were included. The risk of developing AE was significantly higher in patients with elevated serum D-dimer level (adjusted odds ratio: 10.46; 95% CI: 1.24-88.11; p = 0.03). Patients with elevated serum D-dimer level had increased risk for respiratory-related hospitalization, all-cause hospitalization, VTE, and all-cause mortality. The other factors predictive for AE were home oxygen therapy, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase, decreased FVC, and decreased FEV1.0.
3::Patients showed significant impairment in respiratory functioning and psychological distress. Relative to the control, the COPD group exhibited greater depression, anxiety, physical symptom concerns and avoidance (alone and accompanied), irrespective of whether they were panickers or not. Patients with high avoidance showed more intense physical concerns when compared to those with low avoidance. Importantly, the level of avoidance predicted emotional distress and increased physical concerns in COPD.
3::Final clinical diagnoses included 453 children with pneumonia, 133 with asthma, 103 with bronchiolitis, and 143 with upper respiratory infections. In total, CXR confirmed the diagnosis in 191 (42%) of 453 children with clinical pneumonia. A consolidation on lung ultrasound, which is our primary endpoint for pneumonia, had a sensitivity of 88.5%, specificity of 100%, and an area under-the-curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.92-0.97) when compared to radiographically-confirmed clinical pneumonia. When any abnormality on lung ultrasound was compared to radiographically-confirmed clinical pneumonia the sensitivity increased to 92.2% and the specificity decreased to 95.2%, with an area under-the-curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91-0.96).
3::Only the average bone shape of the < 40-year subgroup was statistically different from that of the other two groups. When the population was divided into two subgroups using 40 years of age as a threshold, the subjects age was correctly assigned 80% of the time.'
3::Of the 522 patients who completed the study, eight (1.5%) had a definitive periocular allergic contact dermatitis to the NPD ophthalmic ointment. Allergic presentation ranged from postoperative day 3 to 14.
3::All 4 to 6 planned DQRF sessions were well tolerated in both the vaginal laxity and VVA/GSM arms of the study, with no troubling pain, thermal injury or other immediate adverse effects during all the procedures. All screened women completed the planned DQRF treatment sessions in both arms of the extension study. There was no participant attrition with only a few occasionally missing visits over the 12-month follow-up period. Improvements were rapid in self-perception of introital looseness and related symptoms like dysuria/urinary incontinence and unrewarding sexual relationship (vaginal laxity patients) and atrophy-related symptoms including painful and unsatisfactory sexual activity (VVA/GSM patients). Participating women consistently reported wide-spectrum strong clinical improvements by the end of the planned DQRF sessions. Clinical improvements remained steady for the whole follow-up period in postmenopausal women; a statistically non-significant tendency to slight deterioration in VLQ, PISQ-12 and SSQ mean scores was detected after 6 to 9 months of follow-up in the vaginal laxity arm of the study.
3::Patients cared for, had moderate to very severe COPD and the sample of caregivers ranged from 24 to 406. Thirty-five instruments were used in fifty studies to assess caregivers psychological status and mood (9 instruments), burden/distress (12 instruments), quality of life (5 instruments) or other (9 instruments). Eighteen studies assessed the measurement properties of 21 instruments, most commonly hypothesis testing (known validity) and internal consistency. Study quality varied from 'poor' to 'fair' and with many properties rated as 'indeterminate'.'
3::Low expression of miR-200c-5p and remarkable overexpression of MAD2L1 was uncovered in HCC tissues and cells compared with the normal. The aberrant expression of miR-200c-5p and MAD2L1 was correlated with tumor stage, adjacent organ invasion and prognosis. Direct target relationship between miR-200c-5p and MAD2L1 was confirmed by dual luciferase reporting assay. Up-regulation of miR-200c-5p downregulated MAD2L1 and suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of HCC cells. Moreover, MAD2L1 promoted HCC cell viabilities and co-transfection of MAD2L1 restored the anti-tumor effects of miR-200c-5p overexpression.
3::Among 176 cases and 704 controls, rectal gonorrhea, chlamydia and rectal STI in 12 months or less were associated with HIV diagnosis. The magnitude of these associations attenuated in the second model, but persisted in model 3 (gonorrhea: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-3.8; chlamydia: aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.3; prior STI: aOR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.5-6.2). One in 7 HIV diagnoses can be attributed to rectal STI.
3::Ten patients were examined, 6 ventilated with PSV/PAV+ and 4 with PSV/NAVA. Despite the same mean inspiratory pressure at baseline between the modes, baseline VO2 (median, IQR) was higher during proportional ventilation (301 ml/min, 270-342) compared to PSV (249 ml/min, 206-353). Exercise with PSV was associated with a significant increase in VO2 (ΔVO2, median, IQR) (77.6 ml/min, 59.9-96.5), while VO2 did not significantly change during exercise with proportional modes (46.3 ml/min, 5.7-63.7, p < 0.05). As a result, exercise with proportional modes was associated with a better work efficiency than with PSV. The ventilator modes did not affect patients dyspnea, limb fatigue, distance, hemodynamics and breathing pattern.'
3::The proportion of male gonorrhea cases among MSM varied by jurisdiction (range: 20% to 98%). Estimated MSM rate increased from 1369 cases per 100,000 in 2010 to 3435 cases per 100,000 in 2015. Between 2010 and 2015, the MSM-to-Women gonorrhea rate ratio increased from 13:1 to 24:1, and the MSM-to-MSW gonorrhea rate ratio increased from 16:1 to 31:1.
3::Among women reporting LARC use, 24% used a condom. Dual users were less likely to have only 1 sexual partner (adjusted PR [aPR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.54-0.81) and be in a relationship. Dual users were more likely than LARC-only users to be Hispanic (aPR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.01-1.78), black (aPR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.07-1.83), and biracial/multiracial (aPR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.10-1.73).
3::Among the 82 women with characterized α oral HPV DNA detected at baseline, 14 persisted and were detected 2 years later (17.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.9-28.5%) and was similar to the persistence of α cervical HPV (40/223; 17.7%; 95% CI, 13.1-23.9%; P = 0.86). Acquisition of new α oral HPV type was low; incident infection (1.7%; 95% CI, 0.6-3.7%).
3::Some 3903 studies were identified, of which 27 were selected. A total of 13 risk prediction models have been developed and directly validated. Most models were based on a UK or US population. The best performing models regarding both applicability and discrimination were the perioperative British Aneurysm Repair score (C-statistic 0·83) and the preoperative Vascular Biochemistry and Haematology Outcome Model (C-statistic 0·85), but both lacked substantial external validation.
3::The data were analyzed with an ANOVA. Saline administration did not alter logMAR acuity, contrast sensitivity, corneal fluorescein staining, or subjective complaints at any visit. Betadine administration significantly reduced the logMAR acuity, compared to baseline and the saline data, at the 30- and 60-minute visits (all P values <.05). The contrast sensitivity was significantly reduced compared to the baseline and the saline results at 5, 30, and 60 minutes after Betadine application (all P values <.05). The Betadine significantly increased the Schein questionnaire score, compared both to baseline and the saline data, at the 1- and 4-hour visits (all P values <.05). Total corneal staining and the maximum NEI sector staining were significantly different from baseline and from the saline results at every visit (all P values <.05).
3::Eighty-five patients completed the follow-up. Cumulative relapse rates were 50% (n = 33) at 1 year and 89.4% (n = 76) at 6 years. One-year relapse rates were lower in patients previously treated with clonazepam (P = 0.001) compared with those treated with paroxetine. Low 6-year relapse rates were associated with high Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores before treatment (P = 0.016) and previous treatment with clonazepam.
3::A total of 155 parotidectomies were identified. Tumor size was the only statistically significant clinical predictor (Frey group: 43.5 ± 38.4 mm vs No Frey group: 33.1 ± 27.5 mm; P = 0.018). Disease pathology, type of resection, and previous treatments such as radiotherapy or parotidectomy did not appear to be associated with development of Frey syndrome.Post hoc analysis of our data showed that Frey incidence nearly doubled in patients with tumor size of 4 cm or greater (33%) compared to those with tumors that sized less than 4 cm (18%).
3::Orthotopically implanted PDX-derived tumors consistently incorporated into the murine pancreatic parenchyma, metastasized to both the liver and lungs and induced muscle wasting directly proportional to the size of the tumor, consistent of the cancer cachexia syndrome.
3::Eleven (64.7%) of 17 patients had concordant sPFT and sEUS findings when the cutoff for peak bicarbonate was 80 mEq/L. Six patients had discordant findings with a negative sPFT and positive sEUS. This poor concordance suggests that sEUS is an unreliable functional test. Lowering the sEUS cutoff to 70 mEq/L resulted in improved concordance (64.7% vs 70.6%). Finally, there was no significant correlation between peak bicarbonate concentrations (r = 0.47; 95% confidence interval, -0.02 to 0.79) in these 2 functional tests.
3::The prevalence of PCLs was 13.7%, which was increased according to age. Individuals with PCLs were more prone to obesity (body mass index, 24.0 vs 23.7 kg/m [P = 0.015]; waist circumference, 87.4 vs 85.5 cm [P < 0.001]). DM was more prevalent in individuals with PCLs (18.4% vs 10.5%, P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; P < 0.001), excess body mass index (OR, 1.26; P = 0.039), and DM (OR, 1.39; P = 0.005) were associated with PCLs.
3::Both models discriminated between concussed and nonconcussed groups significantly above chance (with 76% and 86% accuracy, respectively). In the statistical model, patients with mean vertical sinusoidal grating response latencies greater than 119 milliseconds to 0.25-cycle/degree stimuli (or mean vertical sinusoidal latencies >113 milliseconds to 0.50-cycle/degree stimuli) and mean vertical sinusoidal grating amplitudes of less than 14.75 mV to 0.50-cycle/degree stimuli were classified as having had a history of concussion. The resultant receiver operating characteristic curve for this model had excellent discrimination between the concussed and nonconcussed (area under the curve = 0.857; P < .01) groups with sensitivity of 0.92 and specificity of 0.80.
3::The mean age of the women at the time of AMH, FSH, and AFC assessment was 43 years. The cumulative incidence of menopause at 25 years (or follow-up) was 27% (n=426), and the incidence within 5 years was 13% (n=55). Among women aged 45-49 years, undetectable AMH concentrations were associated with a greater than 60% probability of menopause within 5 years, whereas approximately 1/3 of women with no or just one antral follicle experienced menopause within 5 years. Both low and high concentrations of FSH were associated with greater odds of menopause than intermediate concentrations. Models with multiple markers did not improve the prediction of menopause over that afforded by models with single markers.
3::Of the 6303 patients admitted, 843 (13.4%) had ESBL-PE carriage detected. Among carriers, 111 (13%) patients developed ICU-acquired pneumonia of whom 48 (43%) had ESBL-PE pneumonia (6% of carriers). By multivariable analysis, SAPS II at admission >43 [OR 2.81 (1.16-6.79)] and colonization with Enterobacter sp. or K. pneumoniae species [OR 10.96 (2.93-41.0)] were independent predictive factors for ESBL-PE pneumonia in colonized patients, whereas receipt of >2 days of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid during the ICU stay [OR 0.24 (0.08-0.71)] was protective. Patients with ESBL-PE pneumonia had a higher SOFA score (p = 0.037) and more frequent septic shock at pneumonia onset (p = 0.047). However, ESBL-PE pneumonia was not an independent predictor of mortality. Twenty-five patients had pneumonia caused by CRB. Chronic renal insufficiency, administration of third-generation cephalosporin within the past 3 months, acute respiratory distress syndrome before pneumonia and prior therapy with a carbapenem or fluoroquinolones were associated with CRB pneumonia in this selected population.
3::Experiencing IPV and being a caregiver was associated with poor health outcomes on three of the four outcomes (depressive symptoms, OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.58, 2.75; stress, OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.55, 2.87; physical HRQOL β -2.39, 95% CI -3.34, -1.44; all p≤0.001, fully adjusted) compared with not experiencing IPV or caregiving. On these outcomes, IPV and caregiving combined had a stronger association than IPV or caregiving separately. For mental HRQOL, a weaker association was found (OR 1.41 95% CI 1.02, 1.95, fully adjusted, p=0.04).
3::Thirty-six relevant TCM formulae were collected to illustrate the compatibility rationality of TCM from the perspective of pharmaceutics, pharmacokinetics, and/or pharmacodynamics.
3::Mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not statistically different between the two groups, with P = 0.471, 0.429, and 0.847 at baseline, 3 and 6 months, respectively. The incidence of AKI, RRT, and BTT was not statistically different. Mortality was less in the inotrope group (P < 0.001).
3::Two patients with a history of previous abdominal surgery required omental adhesiolysis. Seventeen patients with breast cancer underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, ten had ovarian cystectomy (6 had cystadenoma, 2 had endometriotic cysts and 2 had dermoid cyst), six had excision of paraovarian cysts (one along with partial salpingectomy) and four with ruptured ectopic pregnancy underwent salpingectomy. LESS was completed in all but one patient, who required insertion of an additional 5 mm port. There were no intra- or post-operative complications.
3::Demographic characteristics were not significantly different between the two groups. Compared with open group, the hospital stay and post-operative mechanical ventilation time were significantly shorter, while surgery duration was significantly longer in the endoscopic surgery group. The recurrence rate was higher and the survival rate was lower in the endoscopic surgery group with no statistically significant and the recurrence rate has decreased over the past 5 years.
3::Vildagliptin did not significantly alter the mean plasma glucose level (175.5 ± 54.4 mg/dL vs. 179.1 ± 73.4 mg/dL) or HbA1c (8.01% vs. 8.02%) after 12 weeks. With alogliptin, mean plasma glucose increased from 175.4 ± 50.9 mg/dL to 195.3 ± 55.0 mg/dL after 12 weeks and HbA1c increased significantly from 8.0% to 8.3% (P < 0.05). At 12 weeks after switching from vildagliptin to high-dose sitagliptin (100 mg daily), HbA1c was increased to 8.3%, but it was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced to the baseline level of 8.0% after switching from alogliptin. The reduction of HbA1c was significantly greater in the vildagliptin group than the alogliptin group (P = 0.008), but the response rate (achieving the target HbA1c < 7.0%) did not differ significantly between the two groups.
3::Our results showed no difference in mortality, length of hospital and ICU stays and incidence of major complications between three groups on uni- and multi-variate analysis (P > 0.05). The operative time was significantly longer in MIE group (odds ratio [OR]: 1.66, confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-11.5). The incidence of long-term complication was low for MIE (OR: 1.0, CI: 133-1.017). However, all post-operative surgical outcomes trended to improve in both groups over the course of this study and stayed better for MIE group except for the operative time.
3::Data from the amino-acid blood analysis demonstrated that the levels of L-citrulline and L-arginine decreased on postoperative days 1, coinciding with an increase of ADMA levels. The overall result of these changes was a decrease in the arginine to ADMA ratio by 21% from the preoperative period to postoperative day 2 (P = 0.02).
3::African Americans and non-African Americans did not differ in prevalence of lifetime and current psychiatric disorders and risky behaviors, and HCV knowledge. HCV clinical characteristics were similar between both groups in terms of HCV exposure history, number of months aware of HCV diagnosis, stage of fibrosis, and HCV virologic levels. African Americans did have higher proportions of diabetes, renal disease, and bleeding ulcer.
3::In 58 children with CHC (55.2%) significant liver fibrosis was observed ( ≥F2). Higher proportion of cells expressing CD158e inhibitory receptors was observed in the group of children with ALT > 2UNL (21.11 ± 14.60 vs. 12.22 ± 8.99%; p = 0.037). While higher proportion of cells expressing inhibitory CD158b receptor was observed in children with significant fibrosis (F ≥ 2) compared to minimal fibrosis (F < 2) - (34.14 ± 12.44 vs. 27.48 ± 8.71%; p = 0.049). Children with advanced fibrosis (F ≥ 3) had higher MFI of NK cell CD 158b receptor than children with fibrosis scored F < 3 - (5344.20 ± 3407.49 vs. 2979.67 ± 1190.64; p = 0.049). Proportion of NK cells expressing CD158b was found a predictor of significant fibrosis in univariate analysis - [OR 1.065; 95%CI (1.07-1.15); p = 0.046].
3::Serum HCV RNA was positive in 2 (1%) patients whom considered as MHCI, and 6 (3.03%) patients had positive PBMC HCV RNA.
3::The series was composed of 37 patients with a mean age of 53.2 ± 47.4 years (51.4% female). Mean cyst diameter was 19.4 ± 15.5 cm, and 75.7% of the lesions were located in the right hepatic lobe. The most frequent surgical technique used for the cyst was subtotal pericystectomy (56.8%); the residual cavity was treated by capitonnage (27.0%) or omentoplasty (21.6%), and a phrenoplasty with or without prosthetic material was performed for the TIHE. Mean hospital stay was 6.0 ± 5.7 days and follow-up was 61.4 ± 79.9 months; a mortality rate of 2.7% (one patient) and a POM of 24.3% (9 patients) were verified.
3::Compared with cirrhotic patients without PVT, cirrhotic patients with PVT had comparable plasma values of FVIIa, AT, and the FVIIa-AT complex. However, they had significantly lower values compared to non-cirrhotic patients with PVT and healthy controls. Cirrhotic patients with PVT had increased monocytic TF expression (MIF CD142) compared to non-PVT cirrhotic patients and healthy controls [86.5 (93.5) vs. 18 (32.0) and 11.0 (6.0), respectively; p < 0.001 for each]. However, cirrhosis PVT could not be distinguished from non-cirrhosis PVT. The area under the ROC curve of MIF CD142 was 0.759 (0.641- 0.876; p = 0.000) at an optimal cut-off value of 45, which yielded a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 77.1%, as well as a PPV and NPV of 69.2% for each.
3::No patients had symptoms or signs of DVT pre-operatively. No patient gave history of DVT. No patient was found to have iliac, femoral or popliteal vein thrombosis. Superficial venous disease was found in 17 (8%). One patient had a right lower limb venous ulcer.
3::We reviewed 233 cases of hepatic cancer. Amongst these, hepatocellular carcinomas represented 19.3% (n = 45), followed by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, which accounted for 7.7% (n = 18). The median age of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was 63 years, and most of them presented with cholestasis and intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. Unfortunately, 89% (n = 16) of them were in an advanced stage and 80% had multicentric tumors. Median survival was 286 days among patients with advanced stage tumors (25th-75th interquartile range, 174-645 days). No correlation was found between the presence of comorbidities defined by the Charlson index, and survival. We evaluated the presence of definite and probable risk factors for the development of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, that is, smoking, alcohol consumption, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.
3::A total of 104 patients with negative contrast-enhanced echocardiogram (CE) were compared to 63 patients with IPVD and 63 patients with HPS. Only four patients were categorized as ‘severe’ HPS based on degree of hipoxemia (defined as PaO2 < 60 mmHg). Twenty IPVD patients were followed with ABG over a mean duration of 21 months (range 9-43), of whom 7 (35%) subsequently met HPS criteria. Overall unadjusted survival from the time of LT evaluation using multi-state survival models that accounted for pre- and post-LT time was not statistically different among the three groups (negative CE, IPVD, and HPS; p > 0.5).
3::The mean anastomotic time in four patients who underwent Delta after RADG was 16.5 min. All patients were discharged on the post-operative day 7 without any post-operative complications or need for readmission.
3::Although UB-SDM graduates generally assessed BP (77%) and CBS (23%), most did not follow the schools strict educational policies when providing these services. Dental practice policies mandating BP and CBS assessments were positively correlated with UB-SDM graduates' actually providing these services. Lack of time and poor practice support were cited as negative factors toward BP and CBS assessments.'
3::From a total of 415 residents monitored with the SenseWear(®) activity armbands, 192 met the valid wear-time of 21h or more, and had activity and sleep data recorded. These residents were largely inactive during the daytime (engaged in an average of 1.8h of light physical activity), but achieved recommended amounts of sleep at night (average of 6.8h). There was considerable variation within the sample, and activity and sleep differed by sex (p<0.001), age (p=0.010), mobility (p<0.001), and antipsychotic usage (p=0.030).
3::Four clusters were identified: Poor Sleepers' (31.2%), 'Moderate Sleepers' (30.7%), 'Mixed Sleepers/Highly Active' (20.5%), and 'Excellent Sleepers/Mixed Activity' (17.6%). The 'Poor Sleepers' cluster had the highest proportion of participants with less-than-recommended sleep duration and poor sleep quality, had the poorest health characteristics and a high proportion of participants with low physical activity.'
3::A total of 463 ECC patients were identified. No LNM was detected among the 161 (34.8%) patients who met the criteria and were defined as Very Low Risk. In the other 302 patients, the precise risk of LNM was calculated, and it was <1% in 31 (10.3%) patients.
3::Of 2967 women matching the study criteria, 567 were MHT users. The proportion of general rhinitis symptoms was greater among MHT users (24.5%) than among MHT non-users (18.9%, p=0.003). The proportion of cases of rhinorrhea or posterior nasal drip was also greater among MHT users (6.3% vs. 4.3%, p=0.042), while there were no differences between the two groups in the proportion of cases of nasal obstruction. There were no differences in total IgE and specific IgE levels between the two groups. MHT was used by 23.4% of women with chronic rhinitis and 18.0% of women without chronic rhinitis. Age, waist circumference, and body mass index were also greater among women without chronic rhinitis than among those with chronic rhinitis.
3::Anti-E. histolytica IgG antibodies were found in five (2.7%) of 187 female sex workers and in 16 (4.3%) of 374 controls (odds ratios (OR) = 0.61; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.22 - 1.70; P = 0.34). Mean optical density of the immunoassay in seropositive cases and controls was 1.35 ± 0.93 and 0.73 ± 0.45, respectively (P = 0.05). Seroprevalence of E. histolytica infection did not vary significantly with age, education, socioeconomic level, or health status of sex workers. Seropositivity to E. histolytica did not correlate with work characteristics such as duration in the occupation, condom use, type of sex, or a history of sexually transmitted diseases, or with behavioral variables such as washing hands before eating, or consumption of untreated water.
3::Propofol increased cell death in neurons by 1.8-fold (% of PI-positive cells [PI%] = 18.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15.2-21.9, P < .05) but did not influence astrocyte viability. The neuronal death was attenuated by a high ANR (1:1 cocultures; fold change [FC] = 1.17, 95% CI, 0.96-1.38, P < .05), but not with a low ANR [1:9 cocultures; FC = 1.87, 95% CI, 1.48-2.26, P > .05]). Astrocytes secreted BDNF in a cell density-dependent way and propofol decreased BDNF secretion from astrocytes. Administration of BDNF, CHIR99021, or Mdivi-1 significantly attenuated the propofol-induced neuronal death and aberrant mitochondria in neuron-alone cultures (FC = 0.8, 95% CI, 0.62-0.98; FC = 1.22, 95% CI, 1.11-1.32; FC = 1.35, 95% CI, 1.16-1.54, respectively, P < .05) and the cocultures with a low ANR (1:9; FC = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.74-0.97; FC = 1.08, 95% CI, 0.84-1.32; FC = 1.25, 95% CI, 1.1-1.39, respectively, P < .05). Blocking BDNF receptor or protein kinase B activity abolished astrocyte-induced neuroprotection in the cocultures with a high ANR (1:1).
3::PrEP awareness increased from 2011 to 2014 in both cities (DC: 39.1%-73.8% and Miami: 19.4%-41.2%), but use remained low in 2014 (DC: 7.7%; Miami: 1.4%). Being very likely to use PrEP decreased over time in DC (61%-48%), but increased in Miami (48%-60%). In DC, minority race was associated with increased odds of being very likely to use PrEP, whereas reduced odds of being very likely to use PrEP was observed for MSM with 1 or 2-5 partners versus having 6+ partners. In Miami, a higher proportion of white versus Hispanic MSM reported being very likely to use PrEP in 2011, but this observation was reversed in 2014.
3::Analysis included data from 28,295 sexually active MSM. Overall, 49% of MSM interviewed in 2014 reported syphilis screening, a significant increase from 40% in 2011 and 38% in 2008. In 2014, syphilis screening was most commonly reported by MSM who were aged 25-29 years (56%), HIV positive (68%), and had >10 sexual partners in the past 12 months (65%). The largest increases in syphilis screening between 2008 and 2014 were among MSM aged 30-39 years (37%-52%) and MSM who reported >10 sex partners (48%-65%). Among MSM who reported syphilis screening, the diagnoses of syphilis increased from 9% in 2008 to 11% in 2014. Increases in syphilis diagnosis were observed among MSM who were aged 25-29 years (6%-10%), black (9%-14%), HIV positive (15%-21%), and reported >10 sexual partners (11%-17%).
3::Among 403 linked patients, the mean age was 80 years, 60% were male, mean baseline left ventricular ejection fraction was 49.6%, 83.3% were New York Heart Association class III/IV, 78.2% were MR grade 3+/4+, and 63.3% had functional MR. All-cause hospitalization decreased from 1,854 to 1,435/1,000 person-years (P<.001). HF hospitalization decreased following MitraClip (749 vs 332/1000 person-years, P<.001), but bleeding increased (199 vs 298/1000 person-years, P<.001). Changes in stroke and myocardial infarction were not statistically significant. Overall mean Medicare costs per patient were similar pre- and post-MitraClip, although there was a significant decrease in mean costs among those that survived a full year after MitraClip ($18,131 [SD $25,130] vs $11,679 [SD $22,486], P=.02).
3::With 3,748 patients in the study, we observed rising trends in IE incidence, but no significant difference between pre- and post-guideline. There was a significant trend increase for IE due to viridans group streptococci (VGS) for ages >10 years old, comparing pre-guideline to post-guideline periods, but not in children 0-9 years of age. Neither in-hospital mortality nor length of stay changed significantly during study.
3::Only a very small number (12%) of hospitals incorporated HIE as a primary tool for evidence-based readmission reduction initiatives. Information exchange between providers has been suggested to play a key role in reducing avoidable readmission rates, yet there is not currently evidence supporting current HIE-enabled readmission initiatives. Most successful readmission reduction programs demonstrate collaboration with primary care providers to augment transitions of care to existing care management functions without additional staff while using effective information exchange capabilities.
3::The study included 101 and 21 patients who underwent surgery for UCs and OCs, respectively. Forty percent and 67% of patients who had UCs and OCs, respectively, experienced lymph node metastasis (P = 0.051). Median follow-up time was 12 months (range, 1-158 months) for patients with UCs and 24 months (range 1-154 months) for patients with OCs. Recurrence developed outside the abdomen in 58% of patients with UCs and in 10% of patients with OCs (P = 0.005). Median time to recurrence was 9 months (range 3-58 months) in patients with UCs, whereas it was 18 months (range 11-72 months) in patients with OCs (P = 0.002). Five-year disease-free survival was 34% and 19% for patients with UCs and OCs, respectively (P = 0.90). Five-year overall survival was 56% for patients with UCs and 54% for patients with OCs (P = 0.51).
3::The simulated emergencies were performed by 119 participants. There was overall high consistency (Cronbachs alpha [95% CI] 0.984 [0.981 to 0.987]) and moderate agreement (intra-class correlation coefficients [95% CI] 0.49 [0.35 to 0.63]) among raters. Significantly higher PETRA scores (mean [standard deviation]) were recorded with ""good"" versus ""poor"" performing teams (real scenarios 3.8 [0.7] vs. 2.9 [0.7]; P < 0.001; acted scenarios 4.7 [0.5] vs. 2.2 [0.7]; P < 0.001), suggesting strong construct validity. The overall PETRA scores were not different between the PPH (3.7 [0.7]) and preeclampsia (3.7 [0.8]) scenarios (P = 0.49). Generalizability coefficients were 0.83 for PPH and 0.76 for preeclampsia.'
3::Overall survival (median time) was significantly lower for patients referred by the 2ww' pathway (3.5 years, 95% CI: 2.7-4.30), in comparison to the 'routine' (5.4 years, 95% CI: 4.5-6.6) pathway (p < 0.001). Patients referred on the '2ww' pathway were 1.34 times more likely to have stage IV disease at presentation in comparison to patients referred by the 'routine' pathway. Comparison of referral to initial treatment times showed there was no significant difference in survival between the <62days group and the >62days group (7.1 vs. 6.54, p = 0.620).'
3::Few differences in terms of technical performance were observed between devices. Non-invasive ventilation modes had a huge influence on asynchrony occurrence. Using our global model, either objective tasks completion, psycho-cognitive scales and/or physiological measurements were able to depict significant differences in terms of devices usability. The level of failure that was observed with some devices depicted the lack of adaptation of device's development to end users' requests.'
3::There were positive and statistically significant correlations between N/L ratio and prolonged hospital stay and postoperative antibiotic doses and total antibiotic doses. The optimum cut -off level of N/L ratio was 5.19 according to ROC analysis. However, there was no correlation between MPV and any of these parameters.
3::The FBLC was located at a mean distance of 8.3 mm from the superior cortical of the MF in males and 8.1 mm in females. There was no difference between males and females regarding the mean bone thickness from the MC to the buccal external surface at all the points investigated (p>0.05). Bone thickness from the lingual external surface to the MC was bigger among females than males in regions B and C (p < 0.05). The diameter of the MC was bigger among males in regions B and C.
3::The study included 130 patients with 287 CPET test pairs. Average age was 26.6±9.5 years. Baseline pVO2 averaged 22.0±5.7 mL/kg/min or 60.9%±13.7% predicted. In the cohort overall, there was no change in mean pVO2 between sequential CPETs. Eleven patients died and 2 underwent transplant. On average, pVO2 declined for patients who subsequently died or underwent transplant but remained stable among those who did not (-9.8%±14.6% vs 0.0±13.0%, P<.01). Those with a decline in pVO2 between CPETs were at greater risk of death or transplantation (per 10% decrease in pVO2: HR=2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.1, P=.004). Change in pVO2 remained a significant predictor of death or transplant after adjusting for pVO2 at first CPET (per 10% decline in pVO2: HR=2.5, 95% CI 1.5-4.2, P<.001).
3::Hemoglobin and brain natriuretic peptide levels (300 pg/ml [HFpEF]; 397 pg/ml [HFmrEF]; 521 pg/ml [HFrEF]; ptrend <0.001) showed an upward trend with decreasing LVEF. Network analysis showed that in HFrEF interactions between biomarkers were mostly related to cardiac stretch, whereas in HFpEF, biomarker interactions were mostly related to inflammation. In HFmrEF, biomarker interactions were both related to inflammation and cardiac stretch. In HFpEF and HFmrEF (but not in HFrEF), remodeling markers at admission and changes in levels of inflammatory markers across the first 24 h were predictive for all-cause mortality and rehospitalization at 60 days (pinteraction <0.05).
3::A total of 180 patients were included, of which 110 for the reliability analysis. Fifty-nine patients (33%) had neuropathic pain according to the reference test. Both the painDETECT and DN4 had moderate sensitivity of respectively 75% (95% CI: 61.6-85.0) and 76% (95% CI: 63.4-86.4) and poor specificity of respectively 51% (95% CI: 42.0-60.4) and 42% (95% CI: 33.2-51.5). Combining negative test results for both screening tools increased the sensitivity up to 83% (95% CI: 71.0-91.6). The ICC for the painDETECT was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86-0.94) and for the DN4 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.91).
3::Only 47.9% and 31.3% of subjects showed an SBA titre consistent with protection one and four years, respectively, after the last boost. Protective SBA titres were observed in all sera against B or C strains that entirely matched P1.7,16, and was high (75-100%) for all but one strain that partially matched VR1 or VR2. Extrapolating our data to the OMV component of 4CMenB/Bexsero® suggests that 14.5% of the current B strains would be covered based on PorA matching to the OMV component of 4CMenB/Bexsero® (regardless of the coverage of the three other vaccine components).
3::A higher level of non-disclosure was associated with more depressive symptoms. This relationship was mediated by self-blame and moderated by benefit-finding. Specifically, non-disclosure was associated with depressive symptoms through self-blame. The impact of non-disclosure was minimized among the women with a higher level of benefit-finding.
3::A total of 70 patients were evaluated in each cohort. Operative times and conversion rates were similar. LB patients had lower post-anesthesia care unit pain scores (P = .001) and used less opioids through postoperative day 3 (day 0 P < .01; day 1 P = .03; day 2 P = .02; day 3 P < .01). Daily pain scores were comparable. LB had shorter LOS (mean 2.96 vs 3.93 days; P = .003) and trended toward lower readmission, complication, and reoperation rates. Total costs/patient were $746 less with LB, a savings of $52,200 across the cohort.
3::Thirty-four patients were accrued. Twenty-four out of 34 LN (70.6%) showed persistent RC after a median follow-up time of 27.6 months (range: 12.0-50.2 months), while ten cases of RF (29.4%) were confirmed with a median time of 6.8 months (range: 1.5-19.5 months). Patients with RC showed significantly lower pre-treatment D values compared to the RF patients (p=0.038). At mid-treatment, the patients with RF showed significantly higher D values (p=0.025), and exhibited larger percent reductions in f and the product D*×f from the baseline (p=0.008 and <0.001, respectively). No additional information was provided by the examination at the end of treatment.
3::Univariable analysis identified uniformity (σ0.5), sex, tumour site, nodal stage and carcinoembryonic antigen as potential predictors. Uniformity remained a significant predictor in multivariable analysis to predict early metastases (OR 0.56). None of the parameters could predict intermediate/late metastases.
3::There were no significant differences in stigmatizing attitudes and behavior across the 3 conditions. However, once the data were split by sex, men exposed to the hope condition had significantly higher stigmatizing attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS than men in the other 2 conditions.
3::A significant AUC for differentiation between benign and malignant lesions was identified for choline (0.733, P=0.001), olefinic acids (0.769, P=0.0001) and water-to-methylene ratio (0.704, P=0.003). All three variables were included in a classification algorithm using CHAID methodology. Using this classification, 70.8% (17/24) false positive diagnoses in benign lesions would have been avoided. Inter-reader agreement was almost perfect.
3::The craniocaudal gradients of MPCR in COPD patients were significantly lower than those in normal subjects (right inspiratory phase, 75.5±48.1 vs. 108.9±42.0s(-1)cm(-1), P<0.001; right expiratory phase, 66.4±40.6 vs. 89.8±31.6s(-1)cm(-1), P=0.003; left inspiratory phase, 75.5±48.2 vs. 108.2±47.2s(-1)cm(-1), P=0.002; left expiratory phase, 60.9±38.2 vs. 84.3±29.5s(-1)cm(-1), P=0.002). No significant differences in height, weight, or BMI were observed between COPD and normal groups. In the sub-analysis, the gradients in severe COPD patients (global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease [GOLD] 3 or 4, n=26) were significantly lower than those in mild COPD patients (GOLD 1 or 2, n=17) for both right and left inspiratory/expiratory phases (all P≤0.005).
3::One month post-challenge, 331 participants in the Hexavac cohort [83.6%, 95% CI: 79.6; 87.1] and 324 in the Infanrix hexa cohort [96.4%, 95% CI: 93.8; 98.1] had anti-HBs concentrations ≥10mIU/mL. Before the challenge dose, an anti-HBs concentration of ≥10mIU/mL was found in 94 children in the Hexavac cohort [23.9%, 95% CI: 19.7; 28.4] and in 232 children in the Infanrix hexa cohort [69%, 95% CI: 63.8; 74.0]. Among children with a pre-challenge anti-HBs concentration of <10mIU/mL, 236 [78.7%, 95% CI: 73.6; 83.2] in the Hexavac cohort and 92 [88.5%, 95% CI: 80.7; 93.9] in the Infanrix hexa cohort achieved protective anti-HBs antibody concentrations. No evidence of active hepatitis B disease was observed in either group, and the HBVaxPro challenge dose was well tolerated.
3::405 (64%) responses were received - from 338 (62%) GPs and 67 (71%) PMs. Familiarity and engagement were highest for local frail elderly and end of life care projects (>76% had used). The greatest difference in use concerned the now suspended national care.data initiative: PMs had odds of reporting use 75 times higher than GP partners (95% CI 27-211). Patient confusion was the most pronounced challenge and improved coordination the most pronounced expected benefit. Frequency of discussions with patients varied with IT competence (OR 4.2 for most competent users relative to least, 95% CI 1.7-10.7) and clinical system (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.5). Patient reservations were reported more frequently by respondents who rated their IT competence as highest (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5-7.6), perceived more data sharing challenges (OR for a 1-point increase in challenges perception score 3.4, 95% CI 2.1-5.6) and by PMs (relative to GP partners, OR 18.0, 95% CI 7.9-41.3).
3::The mean (SD) age was 61.2 (13.7) years, and 31% were women. One out of 4 (26%) participants had HF with preserved ejection fraction. Only 25% of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction received guideline-directed medical therapy at discharge. Cumulative all-cause mortality at 1 year was 30.8% (n = 371), but the greatest risk of mortality was in the first 3 months (18.1%). Most deaths (61%) occurred in patients younger than 70 years. One out of every 3 (30.2%) patients was readmitted at least once over 1 year. The hospital readmission rates were similar between HF with preserved ejection fraction and HF with reduced ejection fraction patients. New York Heart Association functional class IV status and lack of guideline-directed medical treatment after index hospitalization were associated with increased likelihood of readmission. Similarly, older age, lower education status, nonischemic etiology, history of stroke, higher serum creatinine, lack of adherence to guideline-directed medical therapy, and hospital readmissions were associated with increased 1-year mortality.
3::User-centered design practices for clinical decision support varied across clinics: 74% conducted pilot testing, 62% conducted provider satisfaction assessment, 36% conducted a formal usability assessment, and 79% conducted an analysis of impact on performance improvement. Overall perceived utility of clinical decision support was high, with a mean rating of 4.17 (±.67) out of 5 on a composite measure. ""Analysis of impact on performance improvement"" was the only user-centered design practice significantly associated with perceived utility of clinical decision support, b=.47 (p<.001). This association was present in hospital-based clinics, b=.34 (p<.05), but was stronger at community-based clinics, b=.61 (p<.001).
3::Mesenchymal stem cells express tissue factor on their surfaces and are procoagulant in the presence of blood or plasma. The adipose-derived MSCs (Ad-MSC) evaluated were more procoagulant and expressed more tissue factor than bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs), which showed a greater variability in TF expression. Bone marrow MSCs were identified that exhibited low procoagulant activity, whereas all Ad-MSCs examined exhibited high procoagulant activity. The percentage of cells in a given population expressing surface tissue factor correlates roughly with functional procoagulant activity. Mesenchymal stem cell tissue factor expression and procoagulant activity change over time in culture.
3::(i) The expression of Drebrin is decreased in the hippocampus of aged AD mice compared with that of age-matched WT and young adult AD mice; (ii) cognitive ability of APP/PS1 mice decreases with age; (iii) Drebrin protein expression in the hippocampus correlates with behavioral performance in different aged AD mice; (iv) cognitive ability improved significantly in APP/PS1-Dbn1 mice; (v) the expression level of Drebrin in APP/PS1-Dbn1 mouse hippocampus was significantly increased; (vi) the pathological lesion of AD was alleviated in APP/PS1-Dbn1 mice; (vii) the filamentous actin (F-actin) and microtubule-associated protein 2(MAP-2) in APP/PS1-Dbn1 mice were notably more than control mice.
3::BDNF and IGF-1 expression was transiently upregulated in both cortex and hippocampus after PBBI. Although BDNF levels increased at acute timepoints, IGF-1 expression peaked at 3 days in cortical homogenates. Although there was loss of staining in cells bordering the cavity, increased BDNF and IGF-1 immunoreactivity was observed in scattered neurons away from the contusion site. Glial upregulation of both growth factors was observed at early timepoints in the hippocampus.
3::In the propensity score-matched analysis, the incidence of pneumonia and/or ARDS among patients who had an anatomic lung resection was 9/172 (5.2%) in the non-PLV compared to the PLV group 7/172 (4.1%; odds ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-3.45, P= .62). The incidence of pneumonia and/or ARDS in patients who underwent nonanatomic resection was 3/118 (2.5%) in the non-PLV compared to the PLV group, 1/118 (0.9%; odds ratio, 3.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-28.84, P= .34).
3::Four hundred three records were screened. Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Four scales were identified: the Scale for Contraversive Pushing (SCP), the Modified Scale for Contraversive Pushing (M-SCP), the Burke Lateropulsion Scale (BLS), and the Swedish Scale for Contraversive Pushing (S-SCP). Psychometric property investigation was most robust for the SCP and the BLS. Cross-cultural validity has not been fully investigated in scales used outside of their country of origin.
3::(1) Skin markings delineating the position of US-visualized landmarks corresponded almost perfectly to anatomical dissection. (2) Nine (64.2%) of 14 specimens had complete division of the transverse carpal ligament. In the remaining 5 specimens, an average of 68.8% of the ligament was transected. (3) No adjacent structures were damaged. (4) Time to complete the procedure was on average 9.9 ± 4.6 minutes. (5) Average procedural difficulty was 4.3/10.
3::Across treatment conditions, 45-60% of the patients who completed posttreatment assessment showed clinically meaningful change for most outcome measures. We found no significant differences between the treatment conditions on any of the outcome measures at both posttreatment and follow-up. Noninferiority of psychodynamic therapy to CBT was shown for posttreatment and follow-up anxiety measures as well as for posttreatment pain and quality of life measures, but could not be consistently demonstrated for the other outcomes.
3::TST in nurses working evening rotating shift was higher than that for those working the day or night rotating shift and fixed day shift. WASO was significantly longer on Day 2 for rotating shift participants working evening versus day shift. SOL and SE were significantly shorter and lower in rotating shift nurses working night versus both day and evening shifts.
3::Mean (SD) age of the subjects was 46 (10) years; 68% were male. Mean (95% confidence interval) IOP measured 13.1 (13.0-13.1) mm Hg in subjects with normal glucose levels, 13.7 (13.6-13.8) mm Hg in subjects with IFG, and 14.3 (14.1-14.4) mm Hg in subjects with diabetes. The difference in IOP between subjects with normal and abnormal (DM or IFG) serum glucose levels were significant, even after adjusting for age, body mass index, and hypertension (P<0.0001). There was a positive linear correlation between serum glucose levels and IOP in both men (r=0.12; P<0.0001) and women (r=0.17; P<0.0001). For every 10 mg/dL increase in fasting serum glucose, IOP increased by 0.09 mm Hg in men and by 0.11 mm Hg in women.
3::Eighty-seven community-dwelling people between the ages of 65 and 90 were recruited, the majority (76%) being women. Seventy-one percent of subjects reported talking to their provider regarding the fall; 37% reported engaging in falls prevention activities. No subjects reported enrolling in a fall prevention program although two reported contacting falls program staff. Fourteen percent of subjects (n=12) reported a recurrent fall and 8% (7) reported returning to the ED after a recurrent fall.
3::MRI identified two main patterns of presentation: global enlargement of the pituitary gland or panhypophysitis (n = 4, PH), and pituitary stalk abnormality only, or infundibulo-neuro-hypophysitis (n = 8, INH). Multiple tropin defects were more common in PH (100%) than those in INH (28% P = 0.014), whereas diabetes insipidus was more common in INH (100%) than that in PH (50%; P = 0.028). All 4 PH and 4 out of 8 INH were treated with glucocorticoids. Pituitary volume significantly reduced in all PH patients (P = 0.012), defective anterior pituitary function recovered only in the two patients without diabetes insipidus (50%) and panhypopituitarism persisted, along with diabetes insipidus, in the remaining 2 (50%). In all INH patients, either treated or untreated, pituitary stalk diameter reduced (P = 0.008) but diabetes insipidus persisted in all.
3::The participants mean age was 29.37 years (SD ± 4.71) and the average duration gestation was 28.81 weeks (SD = 5.05). Depressed women tended to get marry earlier (M = 21.07, SD = 3.47) than the non-depressed group (M = 22.55, SD = 3.36) (p = 0.012) and they had higher number of lifetime gestations (M = 3.31, SD = 2.06) than their non-depressed counterparts (M = 2.33, SD = 1.26) (p = 0.001). Each abuse and neglect score helped to predict the participants' depression scores.'
3::The patients mean age was 68.7 years (81.6% men). The periprocedural complication rates across the 3 categories of statin use were 12.0%, 4.5%, and 1.2%. After adjustment, a change in the atorvastatin dose category was associated with reduction in the odds of periprocedural complications for each change in dose category (standard-dose statin: odds ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.81; high-dose statin: odds ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.96; P for trend=0.01). Administration of antiplatelet drugs was also an independent factor in periprocedural complications (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.05-0.69).'
3::In total we included 58 studies with a total of 6105 participants. The methodological quality was difficult to assess as it was poorly reported in 35 included studies (three or more domains were rated as unclear risk of bias). Two trials of sevoflurane showed a statistically significant reduction in death within 180 to 365days of surgery (on-pump) (RR 4.10, 95% CI 1.42 to 11.79; p=0.009; I(2)=not applicable; high quality of evidence). There was also a statistically significant difference favouring sevoflurane compared to propofol on both inotropic (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.90; p<0.00001; I(2)=0%) and vasoconstrictor support needed (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.22; p=0.03; I(2)=0%) after coronary artery bypass grafting on-pump. Two trials of sevoflurane (MD -0.22, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.03; p=0.02; I(2)=0%) and two further trials of desflurane (MD -0.33, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.20; p<0.00001; I(2)=82%) showed a statistically significant difference on cardiac index during and after coronary artery bypass grafting on-pump, respectively.
3::The total error rate was 7.3% with the automated anesthesia carts (1 in 14 administrations) and 11.9% with conventional manual carts (1 in 8 administrations). Automated anesthesia carts significantly reduced the drug recording error rate compared to conventional manual carts (P<0.01). However, no significant difference of substitution or errors omission errors was found between groups of automated anesthesia carts and conventional manual carts. The anesthesiologists compliance with the automated anesthesia carts was unsatisfactory, and all the errors in medication recordings with the automated anesthesia carts were due to the incorrect use of the carts. Most of the participating anesthesiologists preferred the automated anesthesia carts (P<0.05).'
3::We included 96 patients with 97 pregnancies. The age was 30 (26-34) years and BMI 28 (24-31). Median length of pregnancy at first admission was 23 (13-31) weeks. The three most common diagnoses were biliary colic (n = 63), cholecystitis (n = 22) and acute pancreatitis (n = 16). Conservative treatment was practiced in 62 (64%) patients and intervention in 35 (36%). Conservatively treated patients were admitted later during pregnancy (week 26 (20-33) versus 17 (10-22), p < .001). Surgically treated patients had a longer total length of stay (all admissions) than conservatively treated patients (p = .001), less readmissions (p = .001) and equal birth outcome. Surgical intervention was more common in the later time period (48% versus 22%, p = .011). Of the conservatively treated patients, 56% were subjected to surgical intervention within 2 years after delivery.
3::The proposed method was able to identify 23 possible issues in the original document (ambiguities, omissions, redundant information, and inaccuracies, among others). The formal verification process aided the specialists to consider a wider range of usage scenarios and to identify which instructions form the kernel of the proposed SOP and which ones represent additional or required knowledge that are mandatory for the correct application of the medical document.
3::Overall, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) admissions varied across seasons (P < .01), and were higher in winter (winter vs. spring n = 21,483 vs. 20,291, respectively). When stratified based on type of AMI, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) admissions varied across seasons (P < .01) and were highest in winter and lowest in spring. Seasonal variation was not significant in STEMI admissions (P = .30). Seasonal variation with winter predominance was noted in AMI patients in warmer southern states (P < .01), but not in colder states. The distributions of length of stay for AMI patients and door to balloon times for STEMI patients were minimally different across all four seasons (P < .01) with longest occurring in winter. Most patients with AMI presented during daytime with a peak close to 11 am and a nadir at approximately 4 am.
3::The overall Pearson correlation between GDT and ORC was r=0.87 (p <0.001), while between ORC and EC according the Ministry of Health (MH) was r=0.33 (p<0.001). After clustering data in epidemic and non-epidemic weeks in comparison with GDT correlation were r=0.86 (p<0.001) and r=0.65 (p <0.001) respectively. Important interannual variation of the epidemic was observed. The model shows a high accuracy in comparison with the EC, particularly when the incidence of the disease is higher.
3::The 2009 LVDD Recommendations classified 55 patients (12%) as having normal, 132 (29%) as grade 1, 156 (34%) as grade 2, and 117 (25%) as grade 3 DD. Based on 2016 Recommendations, 177 patients (38%) were normal, 50 (11%) were indeterminate, 124 (27%) patients were grade 1, 75 (16%) were grade 2, 26 (6%) were grade 3 DD, and 8 (2%) were cannot determine. The 2016 Recommendations had superior discriminatory accuracy in predicting LVEDP (P<.001) but were not superior in predicting Tau. During median follow-up of 416 days (interquartile range: 5 to 2004 days), 54 patients (12%) died. Significant DD by 2016 Recommendations was associated with higher risk of mortality (P=.039, subdistribution HR1.85 [95% CI, 1.03-3.33]) in multivariable competing risk regression.
3::Health Behaviour of the consumers influences Health Information Seeking Behaviour. And this relationship is strongly affected by Gender whereby the affect is strongly among females compared to males.
3::Participants (N = 67) were sedentary 62% of the day, engaging in 73.3 total bouts of daily sedentary behavior, and each bout lasted, on average, 7.8 minutes. All participants engaged in >1 daily bout of sedentary behavior > 10 and > 30 minutes. Sedentary time was slightly greater during the evening and on weekdays. Participants averaged 72.9 daily breaks from sedentary behavior, with each break lasting approximately 4.4 minutes.
3::Twenty percent (155/783) had COPD. The PPV of overall appearance specific for COPD alone was low (37-55%). Factors in the diagnostic model were age, type of surgery, gender, distance of the right diaphragm apex to the first rib, retrosternal space, sternodiaphragmatic angle, maximum height right diaphragm (lateral view) and subjective impression of COPD (using both views). The model resulted in a PPV of 100%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 82%, sensitivity of 10% and specificity of 100% with an area under the curve of 0.811.
3::In adjusted models, food insecure non-Hispanic white women and non-Hispanic black women had 53% and over 200% higher odds of being pre-diabetic, respectively. Food insecurity was not related to pre-diabetes for Hispanic women or men.
3::CT values on VMI at 50-130keV (20keV-interval), k, and NIC values were significantly higher in IMCCs than in LAs (p<0.0001). The best single parameter for differentiating IMCC from LA was CT value at 90keV, with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 89.1%, 86.5%, 87.9%, 89.1%, and 86.5%, respectively. The best combination of parameters was CT value at 90keV, k, and NIC, with values of 87.5%, 84.6%, 83.6%, 87.5%, and 84.6%, respectively. Compared with CT value at linear blending images, CT value at 90keV showed greater sensitivity (89.1% vs 60.9%, p<0.0001) and similar specificity (86.5% vs 84.6%, p=1.0000), and combined CT value at 90keV, k, and NIC showed greater sensitivity (87.5% vs 60.9%, p<0.0001) and similar specificity (84.6% vs 84.6%, p=1.0000). Compared with qualitative analysis, CT value at 90keV showed greater sensitivity (89.1% vs 65.6%, p=0.0059) and specificity (86.5% vs 69.2%, p=0.0352), and combined CT value at 90keV, k, and NIC showed greater sensitivity (87.5% vs 65.6%, p=0.0094) and similar specificity (84.6% vs 69.2%, p >0.05).
3::A total of 96 ASD patients were identified, and 63 met the studys inclusion criteria of circumferential MIS or posterior MIS only, with four or more levels instrumented (n: Group 0 = 37, Group + = 15, and Group ++ = 11). Group 0 was younger than ++ (56.8 vs. 69.6 years), with a higher proportion of females than Group + or ++ (83.8% vs. 66.7% and 54.5%, respectively). Baseline HRQoL was similar. Postoperatively, Groups 0 and + had improved Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and numeric rating scale (NRS) back and leg scores. Group ++ only had improvement in NRS scores. At the latest follow-up, Groups 0 and ++ had similar sagittal measurements except for PT (21.6 vs. 23.6, p = .009). The + group had improvement in PI-LL (24.2 to 17; p = .015) and LL (30.9 to 38.3; p = .013). Eight of 27 (21.6%) Group 0 patients deteriorated (4 to Group +, 4 to Group ++). Three of 15 (20.0%) Group + patients deteriorated to Group ++, and 3 improved to Group 0. Six of 11 (54.5%) Group ++ patients improved (3 to Group + and 3 to Group 0).'
3::The median ages of the 3 cohorts were 81 years (elderly, 80-92 years), 71 years (intermediate, 65-79 years), and 58 years (younger, 20-64 years). The elderly cohort was more likely to have cardiac comorbidities. Although the clinical complete response (cCR) rate deviated significantly among the 3 cohorts, (78%, 72%, and 56%; P=.004), the data failed to identify statistically significant differences among RFS, 2-year, and 5-year OS, or in median survival, which was 15.5 months, 23.6 months, and 20.2 months (P=.468), respectively. The overall severe toxicity rates were 38%, 32%, and 30%, respectively (P=.644), including comparable rate of radiation pneumonitis (P>.05). The elderly cohort, however, did show statistically significant evidence of an increased rate of severe radiation pneumonitis (grade ≥3) which was observed to be 11% versus 4% and 0%, respectively (P=.003).
3::Of 738 African American patients with AIS, 223 were assessed for surgical risk factors, and 72 were assessed for curve progression risk factors. Fifty-six (29.17%) had progression of the major coronal curve, and 38 (17.04%) underwent surgery. Age at presentation and curve magnitude at presentation were significant risk factors for surgical intervention. Curve magnitude at presentation was a significant risk factor for curve progression. No significant relationships were found for gender or curve type as they relate to surgical intervention or curve progression.
3::Fourteen patients were included (11 right-handers, 2 left-handers, 1 ambidextrous). The sex-ratio male/female was 0.27 and the average age of 58.1±10.4 years. The main CVRF were age and smoking. In the UL, 42.8% of patients had a history of trophic disorders, Allen maneuver was abnormal for 35.7% of the superficial palmar arch, 42.9% of ulnar pulse were not perceived and there was no recordable flow in 25% of ulnar artery. In the LL, 14.3% of patients had already presented trophic disorders toes, Allen maneuver was abnormal for 15.4% of the posterior tibial artery, 25.6% of posterior tibial pulse were not perceived and flow of 15.4% of posterior tibial arteries was pathological.
3::The prevalence of neck pain was 20.3% (95% CI 17.3-23.7). The adjusted analyses showed that individuals who were widowers or separated (PR=2.26; 1.42-5.88), had a low income (PR=1.32; 1.22-6.27) or low educational level (PR=1.83; 1.02-5.26), worked while sitting and leaning (PR=1.55; 1.08-2.40), and who reported having two or more diseases (PR=1.71; 1.55-6.31) remained associated with neck pain.
3::There was a significant positive relationship between clinical flexibility and both Ravg (p = .041) and αtot (p = .042) adjusting for skeletal age, height, body mass index, and paraspinous muscle area as covariates. The ratio was significantly higher (Ravg = 0.45 vs. 0.38, p < .0001) and the bending angle was significantly greater (αtot = 107° vs. 89°, p < .0001) for girls with scoliosis compared with controls.
3::From July 2010 to November 2013, 36 eligible patients with nonmetastatic stage III-IVb NPC were enrolled. The objective response rates were 97.2% (eight complete responses [CRs] and 27 partial responses [PRs]) and 100% (30 CRs and six PRs) after two cycles of induction chemotherapy (ICT) and CCRT, respectively. With a median follow-up time of 45months, the estimated 3-year progression-free survival and cancer-specific survival were 86.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69.8-99.8%) and 91.7% (95% CI, 68.9-100.0%), respectively. The most frequent grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (8.6%) and nausea (8.6%) after ICT and thrombocytopenia (34.3%) and leukopenia (28.6%) after CCRT.
3::Fifty patients were prospectively enrolled. 26/50 (52%) tumor samples were positive for both p16(INK4A) expression and HR-HPV DNA (22 HPV16, 4 HPV33). Seropositivity was present in 26/26 HPV-attributable OPSCC and one p16(INK4A)-positive/HPV DNA-negative case. The sensitivity and specificity to diagnose an HR-HPV-attributable tumor was 100% and 96%, respectively for anti-E6 reactivity, 82% and 100%, respectively for anti-E2 reactivity, and clearly lower for anti-E7, anti-E1, anti-E4 and anti-L1-reactivity. 3yr-overall (OS) and disease specific survival (DSS) was higher in patients with HR-HPV-attributable tumors (OS 88% vs 64%, p=0.02; DSS 90% vs 80%, p=0.07) and seropositive patients (OS 88% vs 62%, p=0.01; DSS 92% vs 78%, p=0.05) than HR-HPV-negative or seronegative patients.
3::At Node 47005, maximum X-displacement was 5.073 mm corresponding to the incisal edge of the upper central incisor. At Node 3971, maximum negative Y-displacement was -0.86 mm which corresponds to the anterior zygomatic arch, indicating posterior movement of craniofacial complex. At Node 32324, maximum negative Z-displacement was -0.92 mm representing the anterior and deepest convex portion of the nasal septum; indicating downward displacement of structures medial to the area of force application.
3::There were lymph node metastasis in 50.1% of the neck dissections. The pathological record revealed ECS in 50.5% of the positive neck dissections. The implementation of the changes of the 8th edition TNM classification produced the upstaging of 20.9% of the patients classified as pN1 with the 7th edition TNM classification to pN2a¸ and the upstaging of 58.4% of the patients classified as pN2 with the 7th edition TNM classification to pN3b. We conducted an objective comparison of the quality of both classifications. The 8th TNM classification edition achieved better results regarding both the discrimination in cause-specific survival between pN categories and in the distribution in the number of cases between categories than the 7th edition TNM classification.
3::Tracheal epithelial tissue derived from tdTomato-labeled iPSCs survived in the tracheal defects. Moreover, immunochemical analyses showed that differentiated tissues had epithelial structures similar to those of proximal tracheal tissues.
3::At median follow-up of 54months, 5 patients failed regionally and 4 emerged with a primary (tongue base, hypopharynx and thoracic esophagus). Five-year rates of regional control, primary emergence, distant metastasis, disease-free survival and overall survival were 90%, 10%, 20%, 72% and 79%, respectively. The 5year rate of primary emergence in a non-oropharynx site was 3%.
3::Through 2011, over 3,038,049 person-years of follow-up, we documented 261 incident cases of CD and 321 incident cases of UC. Dietary heme iron was nonsignificantly associated with increased risk of UC (Ptrend = 0.12). This association seemed to be modified by the UC susceptibility locus, rs1801274, a coding variant in the FcγRIIA gene (Pinteraction = 7.00E-05). In contrast, there was no association between dietary heme iron and risk of CD (Ptrend = 0.67). We also did not observe an association between total dietary intake of iron and risk of CD or UC (All Ptrend > 0.35).
3::Of 5154 women, 11% were incarcerated within the previous year, 36% were ever incarcerated but not in the past 12 months, and 53% were never incarcerated. Prevalence of exchange sex (aPR 1.32, 1.20-1.46), multiple casual partners (aPR 1.59, 1.2-2.1), multiple casual condomless partners (aPR 1.47, 1.07-2.03), and sexually transmitted infection diagnosis (aPR 1.61, 1.34-1.93) were all higher among recently incarcerated women compared with those never incarcerated. We also found higher prevalence of recent HIV testing among women recently incarcerated (aPR 1.30, 1.18-1.43).
3::A total of 110 infusions were given to 54 patients. Compared with baseline preinfusion hemoglobin (Hb; 9.2 ± 1.9 g/dL), a significant rise was seen at 1 week and 4 weeks postinfusion (11.5 ± 1.5 and 11.8 ± 1.7 g/dL, respectively, P < 0.001). Also, a significant rise in serum ferritin at 1 week and 4 weeks postinfusion was seen (51 ± 71 vs 192 ± 148 and 89 ± 135 ng/mL, P < 0.001 and <0.035, respectively). Patients who concomitantly received erythropoietin had a significantly larger Hb rise from baseline than those who did not at 4 weeks (2.7 ± 2.2 vs 1.6 ± 1.1 g/dL, P < 0.017). ADRs included pruritus (n = 1), urticaria (n = 1), and multisymptom episodes (n = 3) that included shortness of breath, chest tightness, back pain, and epigastric cramping that responded to therapy with IV diphenhydramine and methylprednisolone.
3::There was a high correlation (0.93) between the percentage of reported living HIV cases attributed to male heterosexual contact and female heterosexual contact and a moderate nonsignificant correlation (0.49) between the percentage of MSM who were men who have sex with men and women (MSMW) in National HIV Behavioral Surveillance and the percentage of reported cases that were attributed to female heterosexual contact suggesting some potential overlap. Cities with high levels of poverty and African American/Black residents had higher levels of MSMW and higher levels of heterosexual female cases.
3::Frequent IU increased from 21% in 2008 to 44% in 2014 (APR = 1.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.36 to 1.42), and having met the last partner online increased from 19% in 2008 to 32% in 2014 (APR = 1.30, 95% confidence interval: 1.26 to 1.34). Those who never used the internet had fewer partners (median of 2 in the past 12 months, interquartile range: 1-4) compared with infrequent (4, 2-7) and frequent users (5, 3-12). HIV testing in the past 12 months also increased with increasing IU (58%, 68%, and 71%, respectively, P < 0.0001). Among HIV-positive participants, the percent HIV-positive awareness increased as IU increased (71%, 75%, and 79%, P < 0.005).
3::Bridge clinic patients were at higher baseline risk of readmission and death; other characteristics were similar. 90-day death and all-cause readmission trended lower in bridge clinic patients (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.64; 95% CI = 0.40-1.02; P = 0.06). Time to first follow-up was shorter in bridge clinic patients (11 ± 6 vs 20 ± 23 days; P < 0.001); time to first all-cause readmission trended longer (40 ± 20 vs 33 ± 25days; P = 0.11). 30-day death and all-cause readmission was significantly lower in bridge clinic patients (adjusted HR = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.22-0.88; P = 0.02).
3::The differences of RMSTs (DPP-4 inhibitors minus placebo) for hospitalization for heart failure were -4 days [-6, -2] in the SAVOR-TIMI 53 (720 days follow-up), -3 days [-9, 3] in the EXAMINE (900 days follow-up), and 1 day [-5, 7] in the TECOS (1440 days follow-up). There were no substantial differences in the risk of other cardiovascular outcomes between DPP-4 inhibitors and placebo.
3::Out of a sample of 96 known HIV-positive men, 59 men self-reported an undetectable HIV viral load and 9 men self-reported a detectable viral load consented to confirmatory laboratory testing. The sample of self-reported undetectable men had gradually larger proportions of higher-risk sexual practices, whereas the sample of detectable men was evenly distributed across sexual practices. This association was not statistically significant (P = 0.91).
3::Curcumin could promote injury-induced cell autophagy, remyelination and axon regeneration in sciatic nerve of rats. In vitro, curcumin could accelerate cell autophagy through regulating autophagy related Erk1/2 and Akt pathway, prevent cell apoptosis and promote expression of PMP22 and S100, and reduced deposition of Fibrin in cultured RSC96 SCs.
3::A total of 7349 patients were identified meeting study criteria, of whom 1187 were elderly (aged >70 years) with a median follow-up of 30.6 months. Of these elderly patients, 445 had ECE or positive margin and represent the study population, of whom 187 (42%) received CRT. Delivery of CRT in this cohort increased over the study period, and intensity modulated radiation therapy was associated with increased use of CRT (odds ratio 2.07; P=.004). Increasing age was associated with reduced use of CRT (odds ratio 0.88; P<.001). Chemoradiotherapy was associated with a significant improvement in OS on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 0.74; P=.04) and a trend toward significance on inverse propensity score analysis (hazard ratio 0.78; P=.051). Three-year OS was 53.8% in the CRT group, compared with 44.6% in the adjuvant radiation therapy-alone patients.
3::Sixteen patients received 5 years of pasireotide treatment. Among these, median (95% confidence interval) percentage change from baseline in mean urinary free cortisol was -82.6% (-89.0, -41.9) and -81.8% (-89.8, -67.4) at months 12 and 60. Eleven patients had mean urinary free cortisol ≤ upper limit of normal at month 60. Improvements in clinical signs were sustained during long-term treatment. The safety profile of pasireotide at 5 years was similar to that reported after 12 months. Fifteen of 16 patients experienced a hyperglycaemia-related adverse event; glycated haemoglobin levels were stable between months 6 and 60. Adverse events related to hyperglycaemia, bradycardia, gallbladder/biliary tract, and liver safety were most likely to first occur by month 6; adverse event severity did not tend to worsen over time.
3::Some drugs appear to be feasible options for patients with hepatic insufficiency. Agents such as 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin, as well as monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab, can potentially be used in these cases. On the other hand, irinotecan and regorafenib cannot be recommended because of the risk of increased toxicity.
3::Over ten years, rotavirus vaccination would prevent 4000 deaths, nearly 500,000 hospitalizations and 3 million outpatient visits in the base scenario. With a Gavi subsidy, cost/disability adjusted life year (DALY) ratios ranged from $58/DALY to $142/DALY averted. Without a Gavi subsidy and a vaccine price of $2.19 per dose, cost/DALY ratios ranged from $615/DALY to $1514/DALY averted.
3::Stepwise regression analysis revealed that interpersonal relations, physical activity, and psychological distress accounted for 21% of the variance in life satisfaction (SWLS). Interpersonal relations, nutrition, stress management, spiritual growth and psychological distress accounted for 53% of the variance in psychological well-being (PWB).
3::About one-fourth of survey respondents have visited their home country for medical care since their migration to the US. Of those with relatives in Korea, 29% have experienced at least one medical tour, compared to only 9.2% of those without relatives in Korea. Having frequent contacts with relatives in the home country was positively associated with the number of medical tour visits.
3::A total of 12 reports (7 observational studies and 5 abstracts from conferences) involving 255 patients were included in the analysis. The primary sites of melanoma were cutaneous (n=22; 8.6%), ocular (n=197; 77.3%), rectal (n=3; 1.2%), and unknown (n=33; 12.9%). The median disease control rate at 3 months was 73.6% (range, 58.3%-88.9%). Among the 207 patients for whom tumor response at 3 months was reported, complete response was seen in 1.0% (2/207), partial response was seen in 19.3% (40/207), stable disease was seen in 46.9% (97/207), and progressive disease was seen in 32.9% (68/207). The median survival was 10 months (range, 7-13.4 months), and the median 1-year survival rate was 34.6% (range, 23%-80%). Complications of (90)Y radioembolization were reported in 13 cases. The most common side effects were fatigue (median, 36.1%), abdominal pain (median, 17.8%), and nausea (median, 15.0%).
3::No significant differences in age or gender appeared between groups. On qualitative analysis, T2 dark strands were identified in 90% by both radiologist (K=0.82) of awdt, while fascial tail was identified in 70% by radiologist 1 and 80% by second radiologist (k=0.91) of awdt; however no other lesions showed these findings. Other subjective imaging findings did not significantly differ between groups with moderate-to-strong agreements (k=0.7-1.0). On quantitative measurements, diffusion imaging awdt lesions showed higher mean ADC value compared to other lesions, although it did not reached at the level of significance. While on DCE MRI, all awdt lesions showed type 1 (progressive) DCE curve, however no significant difference was observed between groups.
3::Retention was 90%. Over long-term maintenance, there was a decline in PA, but levels remained significantly higher than baseline for moderate/vigorous PA (p < .001), leisure moderate/vigorous PA (p < .001) and walking (p = .006). Variations by condition/site were not statistically significant.
3::The literature search identified 57 published case reports that were reviewed for inclusion. Of those published cases, etiologic factors can be classified into idiopathic, acquired, and traumatic causes. Most AVAs are limited to the azygos arch, a congenital anatomic weak point. Clinical symptoms generally remain nonspecific. Computed or magnetic resonance tomography scans are effective diagnostic tools, although the optimal therapeutic plan remains unclear. Complications include rupture, thromboembolism, mediastinal mass effects, and pulmonary artery hypertension.
3::We revealed the association of genotype G/G with the increased risk of PVVs (odds ratio [OR], 1.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-3.44; P = .04). In the subgroup analysis, association was revealed only in patients with C2 Clinical, Etiology, Anatomy, and Pathophysiology class (allele G: OR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.13-2.33; P = .008]; genotype G/G: OR, 3.22 [95% CI, 1.43-7.27; P = .005]), in patients with age at onset of PVVs before 30 years (allele G: OR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.08-1.85; P = .01]; genotype G/G: OR, 2.35 [95% CI, 1.22-4.55; P = .01]), and in patients who declared no family history (allele G: OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.02-2.09; P = .04]; genotype G/G: OR, 2.50 [95% CI, 1.11-5.63; P = .03]).
3::The procedure succeeded in all 16 patients. During follow-up (mean, 12 months; range, 3-36 months), access failure due to thrombosis was observed in one patient. The remaining continued to function well until the end of the follow-up period or until the death of the patient (n = 3). No pneumothorax occurred. The most common complication was mediastinal hematoma after puncture failure in five patients. The diameter of the maximum hematoma was 2.2 cm, and all resolved spontaneously.
3::EVTA of the great saphenous vein (n = 146), small saphenous vein (n = 20), or both (n = 7) was performed on 173 limbs with active (n = 72) or healed (n = 101) ulcers. Deep venous insufficiency was present in 54 cases (31.2%). Concomitant phlebectomy was performed in 59 limbs (34%). Median follow-up time was 25.2 months after EVTA. Venous ulcers healed after EVTA in 57% of cases at 3 months, 74% at 6 months, and 78% at 12 months. Ulcers recurred in 9% of patients at 1 year after EVTA, 20% at 2 years, and 29% at 3 years of follow-up. Ulcers recurred significantly more often in patients with deep venous insufficiency and in patients who did not undergo phlebectomy of associated varicose veins at the time of EVTA.
3::In the F1 3xTg-AD/C3H animal model of AD, there was no detectable reduction of brain volume over a period of 10months of treatment, as there was not brain atrophy in any of the placebo or treatment groups. Laquinimod had no detectable effects on most neurobehavioral outcomes. The number or composition of CNS intrinsic cells and mononuclear subsets isolated from the CNS were not altered by laquinimod.
3::During a median (interquartile range) follow-up duration of 51 (41-68) days, complete vein occlusion was achieved in 98.4% of 438 EVLA procedures in 306 patients. One patient had an EHIT level 2 (0.2%; 95% confidence interval, 0.006%-1.3%). No major bleedings (0%; 95% confidence interval, 0.0%-0.8%) and six minor bleedings (1.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5%-3%) were observed.
3::Seventy-four limbs in 70 patients who underwent iliac vein stenting for ICVO were identified; 36 limbs (48.6%) were stented for nonthrombotic venous compression (stent-VC), and 38 limbs (51.4%) were stented for venous thrombosis (stent-VT). Twenty-seven limbs (71.1%) of the stent-VT group were treated for acute venous thrombosis requiring lysis followed by stenting for underlying venous lesions. The median number of follow-up visits for the stent-VC and stent-VT groups was two (interquartile range [IQR], 1-4) and two (IQR, 1-3), whereas the mean length of follow-up was 19.6 ± 29.5 months and 19.8 ± 26.5 months (P = .972), respectively. During the first 6 months, one limb (2.8% [n = 36]) in the stent-VC group occluded, whereas 13.2% (5/38) of the limbs in the stent-VT group occluded. In the stent-VT group, 57% of limbs (4 of 7) with acute venous thrombosis requiring thrombolytic therapy had limb occlusion at >6 months (median, 18.1 months; IQR, 16.6-30.1). Overall patency rates for the stent-VC and stent-VT groups were 97.2% (1/36) and 73.7% (10/38) at 36 months (standard error, ≤10%; P = .001), respectively.
3::Increases in excessive alcohol consumption among women, sleep problems among men, and smoking, insufficient sleep duration and poor self-reported health for both genders were observed in the French working population between 2006 and 2010. Some differential changes were observed, negative changes being more likely to affect young workers and workers with a permanent contract.
3::Consistent with previous results, extinction and cue-induced reinstatement were attenuated in adolescent-onset groups compared with adults; this age difference also extended to drug-primed reinstatement. In support of the present hypothesis, an impoverished environment during abstinence increased reinstatement among adolescents to levels that were not different from adult standard-housing levels.
3::The mean age of the patients was 44.05 ± 6.31 years. Twenty-two patients (57.9%) had a history of uterine leiomyoma. Nine patients (23.7%) had a history of IVL without IVCE or ICE. The most common symptoms were chest tightness (seven patients), lower limb swelling (five patients), palpitation (four patients), dizziness (two patients), and abdominal distention (two patients). Preoperative diagnoses were achieved in 28 patients (73.7%); 23 patients (60.5%) underwent one-stage surgery, whereas 15 (39.5%) underwent two-stage surgery. Eighteen patients (72%) received postoperative antiestrogen hormone therapy. Regular follow-up was available in 30 patients, with a median follow-up time of 12.0 months; 15 patients (50.0%) showed evidence of recurrence. Factors such as postoperative antiestrogen hormone therapy (9/20 compared with 6/10; P = .601), duration of postoperative hormonal therapy (10/15 in >6 months compared with 5/15 in ≤6 months; P = .862), and heart involvement (10/22 compared with 5/8; P = .669) were not significantly associated with recurrence.
3::Within placental villi, ADAM28 mRNA levels were highest in HLA-G(+) column trophoblasts, and consistent with this, ADAM28 was preferentially localized to HLA-G(+) trophoblasts within distal anchoring columns and decidual tissue. siRNA-directed loss of ADAM28 impaired trophoblast column outgrowth and resulted in increased apoptosis in matrix-invading trophoblasts.
3::Consistent with prior research, 50% of youth met criteria for a co-occurring anxiety or depressive disorder. Rates of externalizing disorders were lower (16%). Developmental differences emerged such that older youth met criteria for a higher number of co-occurring disorders. As expected, adolescents in particular were more likely to have a co-occurring internalizing disorder compared to early or pre-adolescent peers. Surprisingly, they were also more likely to have a comorbid externalizing disorder. Developmental trends were particularly striking with respect to depression, with adolescents with OCD demonstrating a six-fold greater likelihood of co-occurring depressive disorder compared to younger counterparts.
3::Initially the trophoblast extended over a rather broad but shallow area, enclosing maternal blood spaces. After expansion of the exocoelom it became covered by somatic mesoderm. The mature chorioallantoic placenta was haemochorial and characterized by a labyrinth with markedly dilated maternal blood spaces. Blood vessels appeared in the splanchnopleure early in development and later extended to the yolk sac, but we found no evidence of a choriovitelline placenta at any stage of gestation. There was, however, an extensive paraplacenta.
3::An exploratory factor analysis with promax rotation as well as confirmatory factor analyses revealed a three-factor solution of Externalizing, Anxiety, and Mood syndromes, with a higher order Internalizing factor comprised of the Mood and Anxiety factors.
3::We uncovered sub-sets of genes that regulate response to stress, induction of apoptosis programmed cell death, mis-regulation of cell growth, proliferation, cell morphogenesis, tissue viability, and protection from apoptosis in cultured placental explants. We also identified a sub-set of genes with highly unstable pattern of expression after exposure to tissue culture. Tissue culture irrespective of oxygen concentration induced dichotomous increase in significant gene expression and increased enrichment of significant pathways and transcription factor targets (TFTs) including HIF1A. The effect was exacerbated by culture at atmospheric oxygen concentration, where further up-regulation of TFTs including PPARA, CEBPD, HOXA9 and down-regulated TFTs such as JUND/FOS suggest intrinsic heightened key biological and metabolic mechanisms such as glucose use, lipid biosynthesis, protein metabolism; apoptosis, inflammatory responses; and diminished trophoblast proliferation, differentiation, invasion, regeneration, and viability.
3::At physiological insulin concentrations, the IR, not the IGF-1 receptor, facilitated BEC insulin uptake, which required lipid raft-mediated endocytosis, but did not require insulin action on phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). Feeding rats an HFD for 4 weeks decreased iBEC insulin uptake and increased NF-κB binding activity without affecting insulin PI3K signalling, IR expression or content, or insulin degrading enzyme expression. Using an in vitro BBB (co-culture of iBECs and astrocytes), we found insulin was not degraded during transcytosis, and that stimulating astrocytes with L-glutamate increased transcytosis, while inhibiting nitric oxide synthase decreased insulin transcytosis.
3::The preoperative curve was 61 degrees for SGGS and 65 degrees for GR (NS). After index surgery, the major curve decreased to 24 degrees (-37 degrees) for SGGS and 38 (-27 degrees) for GR (p < .05). At last follow-up, the major curve was 34 degrees (44%) for SGGS and 36 degrees (45%) for GR (NS). The initial T1-T12 length for SGGS was 188 mm and for GR, 181 mm; at last follow-up, SGGS was 234 mm (46 mm increase) and GR was 233 mm (52 mm increase) (NS).
3::Design quality of physical healthcare environments involves three different themes: (i) environmental sustainability and ecological values, (ii) social and cultural interactions and values, and (iii) resilience of the engineering and building construction. Design quality was clarified herein with a definition.
3::A total of 6602 tests demonstrated mannitol recovery, lactulose recovery, and the L:M ratio were associated with country, sex, and age. There was heterogeneity in the recovery of both probes between sites with mean mannitol recovery ranging for 1.34% to 5.88%, lactulose recovery of 0.19% to 0.58%, and L:M ratios 0.10 to 0.17 in boys of 3 months of age across different sites. We observed strong sex-specific differences in both mannitol and lactulose recovery, with boys having higher recovery of both probes. Alterations in intestinal barrier function increased in most sites from 3 to 9 months of age and plateaued or diminished from 9 to 15 months of age.
3::80.8% of 567 191 pregnant women were screened for GDM. Most of them (63.3%) received only the pre-test, and 12.7% received both the pre-test and the diagnostic test. 4.8% received only the diagnostic test. The overall prevalence of GDM was 13.2%. The prevalence rose with age, from 8% to 26% in women aged 45 or older. Younger women more commonly received only the pre-test; the frequency of receiving both tests rose with age.
3::AIRmax (SS) mice showed differential peritoneal macrophage gene expression profiles during PIA, with higher expression and production of H2O2, NO, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and several chemokines. The presence of the Slc11a1 R allele, on the other hand, diminished the intensity of macrophage activation, restricting arthritis development.
3::The major ingredients including alkaloids, flavonoids, amino acids, saccarides, ginsenosides, lignans and terpenoids were readily detected. Compared with electrospray ionization (ESI), EAPPI allowed the ionization of a wider range of compounds, which is desirable for the integral characterization of TCHMs containing numerous constituents. The significant discrepancies for both alkaloids and terpenoids in tripterygium glycosides tablets from two different manufacturers could be simultaneously reflected from EAPPI mass spectra.
3::There was a significant difference between CPI obtained from all patients with elevated right atrial pressure compared to those with normal right atrial pressure (P < .0001). This finding was consistent in sensitivity analysis that compared right and left hemispheric CPI from patients with both elevated and normal right atrial pressure.
3::There was no significant difference in the survival rate after vitrification and warming of GV (93.5%) and MII oocytes (90.8%). A significantly higher maturation rate occurred when IVM was performed before vitrification (82.9%) compared to after vitrification (51%). There was no significant difference in the incidence of normal spindle/ chromosome configurations among warmed oocytes matured in vitro before (50.0%) or after (41.2%) vitrification. However, a higher incidence of normal spindle/chromosome configurations existed in the in vitro matured oocytes which were not subjected to vitrification (fresh oocytes, 77.9%).
3::Within each group, significant improvements were found for clinical parameters, though without significant differences between groups. RANK-L was significantly decreased at week 13 in the SRP+PDT group compared with the SRP group. SRP+PDT, but not SRP alone, significantly reduced the abundance of A. actinomycetemcomitans.
3::Five hundred surveys were mailed, with 169 (33.8%) being returned. The median age of the respondents was 57 years (range: 18-92 years); 53% were female. The majority (89.3%) of participants recalled receiving information about pain self-management. Analgesic use was reported by 95.4% of participants in the week following discharge. Moderate-severe pain was reported by 80 participants (47.3%); 63.7% and 11.3% of patients reported underuse and overuse of analgesics compared to what was recommended, respectively.
3::The preparation techniques did not affect the percentage of accumulated hard-tissue debris (P = 0.126). The percentage of untouched canal areas was significantly higher for BioRace (32.38%), and Reciproc (18.95%) with the SAF (16.08%) system having the least untouched area results (P < 0.05). The Reciproc system removed significantly more dentine (4.18%) compared to the BioRace (2.21%) and SAF (2.56%) systems (P < 0.05). The TRUShape system had intermediate results for both untouched canal areas (19.20%) and dentine removed (3.77%), with no significant difference compared to BioRace, Reciproc and SAF systems.
3::The Cox regression model best predicts average incidence of the outcome over time, whereas CTA survival models best predict either relatively high, or low, incidence of the outcome over time.
3::Chronic ketamine prevented the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by BDNF, without affecting locomotion and food and water consumption. After pump depletion, a late hyperalgesic response to paw pressure stimulation emerged, which can be lastingly antagonized by cyclotraxine-B. Chronic propentofylline treatment irreversibly suppressed BDNF-induced hyperalgesia.
3::The LN was identified in 10.4% of 1332 cholecystectomies. The American Society of Anesthesiologists class 3 was associated with a lower rate of LN excision compared with class 1 (odds ratio: 0.36; P = 0.049) as was the presence of a senior surgical trainee (odds ratio: 0.18; P < 0.001). Rate of LN excision was independent of patient demographic and clinical characteristics, including indication for cholecystectomy, conversion to open, gallbladder perforation, cholangiography, bile duct exploration and overall surgical difficulty.
3::Median (range) age was 57 (44-60) years, median follow-up 8.9 (1.5-17.2) years and median PSA follow-up 5.9 (0.8-15) years. Low, intermediate and high-risk disease represented 53%, 37% and 10% of cases. Ten years post-implant overall and prostate cancer-specific survival were 98% and 99% for low-risk, 99% and 100% for intermediate and 93% and 95% for high-risk disease respectively. Ten years post-implant relapse free survival using the nadir plus 2 definition was 95%, 90% and 87% for low, intermediate and high-risk disease respectively. Urinary stricture was the most common genitourinary event observed in 19 (3.2%) patients. Preserved erectile function five years post-implant was observed in 75% of patients who were potent prior to treatment.
3::In total, 11.7% (N = 1048) of the respondents reported having multiple jobs and 7.6% (N = 678) experienced LTSA during follow-up. After adjustment for confounders, no significant association between LTSA and MJH in general (OR = 0.82), combination MJH (OR = 0.81), or hybrid MJH (OR = 0.83) was found. Among employees working more than 37 h per week, combination MJH was associated with a higher likelihood of LTSA (OR = 1.50).
3::Thematic analysis showed planners need to build a partnership based on mutual trust and respect with a person with complex support needs and harness a range of skills to respond to individual support needs, learning capacity, systemic hurdles and life challenges.
3::Overall, 64 of the 96 centers (66.7%) completed the questionnaire. Most centers (98.4%) had been using OBT-A for >1 year. OBT-A was administered according to the PREEMPT paradigm in most centers (88.9%). While during the first year of prophylaxis with OBT-A most clinicians (93.6%) repeated OBT-A treatment every 3 months, as recommended, in the following years interval duration was variable. Response to OBT-A was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in the headache days by 58.7% of the clinicians, and as a ≥ 30% reduction by 25.4% of them. Almost 60% of the clinicians considered OBT-A as a long-lasting therapy, while for one-third of them treatment could be discontinued in patients showing a benefit for ≥6 months. According to 80% of the clinicians, early administration of OBT-A after the onset of chronic migraine was associated with better outcomes, and 47.6% felt that OBT-A should be recommended as a first-line option.
3::A total of 145 cases met the inclusion criteria, while 123 (84.8%) patients had follow-up data available. Of these patients, 67.5% underwent FNA as the only pathologic diagnostic modality. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the detection of cystic neoplasms were 41.6%, 99.0%, 90.9%, and 87.6%, respectively. For cases containing mucin, 100.0% sensitivity and specificity were achieved.
3::Group demographics were indistinguishable except for the number of robotically assisted procedures performed (p = 0.001). The mean scores of experienced subjects exceeded those of novices in dexterity (3.8 > 1.4, p < 0.001), field of view (4.1 > 1.8, p < 0.001), instrument visualization (3.9 > 2.2, p < 0.001), manipulator workspace (3.6 > 1.9, p = 0.001), and force sensitivity (4.3 > 2.6, p < 0.001). The mean scores of intermediate subjects exceeded those of novices in dexterity (2.8 > 1.4, p = 0.002), field of view (2.8 > 1.8, p = 0.021), instrument visualization (3.2 > 2.2, p = 0.045), manipulator workspace (3.1 > 1.9, p = 0.004), and force sensitivity (3.7 > 2.6, p = 0.033). The mean scores of experienced subjects exceeded those of intermediates in dexterity (3.8 > 2.8, p = 0.003), field of view (4.1 > 2.8, p < 0.001), and instrument visualization (3.9 > 3.2, p = 0.044). Rater agreement in each domain demonstrated statistically significant concordance (p < 0.05).
3::There were 231 patients with isolated rib fractures (132 men and 99 women). The mean age was 65 years. Rib fractures were most commonly diagnosed at the emergency department and most of the patients were referred to the department of thoracic surgery for follow-up evaluations. Of these 231 patients, 29 (12%) had DXA examinations after the injury, and only 9 (4%) of them did so within 6 months. Physicians specializing in orthopedic surgery, family medicine, internal medicine, rehabilitation medicine, and emergency medicine were ordering the examination.
3::Twenty patients (67%) were male. The median patient age at diagnosis was 56 years (range, 39-76 years). A total of 702 polyps were identified during a median follow-up of 43 months (range, 0-149 months). Serrated polyps were noted more frequently in the distal colon (298/702, 55%). However, large serrated polyps and serrated adenomas were mainly distributed throughout the proximal colon (75% vs. 25% and 81% vs. 19%, respectively); 73.3% had synchronous adenomatous polyps. The incidence of CRC was 10% (3/30 patients), but no interval CRC was detected. A total of 87% of the patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and 19.2% had significant lesions.
3::In 141 parasites, eight nucleotide changes (two changes were synonymous and other six were nonsynonymous) were detected in 1536 bp. The PvMDR1 amino acid changes Y976F, F1076FL were predominant in endemic parasites from NIC-NE and outbreak parasites in NIC-NW but absent in SMX. Thirteen haplotypes were resolved, and found to be closely related, but their frequency at each geographic site was different (P = 0.0001). The pvmdr1 codons 925-1083 gene fragment showed higher genetic and haplotype diversity in parasites from NIC-NE than the other areas outside Latin America. The haplotype networks suggested local diversification of pvmdr1 and no significant departure from neutrality. The F ST values were low to moderate regionally, but high between NIC-NE or NIC-NW and other regions inside and outside Latin America.
3::Mice developed NASH after fed with CL diet for 12 weeks. Honokiol supplementation alleviated insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis induced by CL diet. Immunohistochemistry showed honokiol induced more M2 macrophages in livers compared with CL diet alone. Honokiol decreased M1 marker genes (TNFα, MCP-1), increased M2 marker genes (YM-1, IL-10, IL-4R, IL-13) expression in mice liver compared with CL diet. Moreover, treatment with honokiol lowered ALT and AST in serum and preserved liver from lipid peroxidation, evidenced by lowered hepatic MDA level. Honokiol has antioxidant function, as honokiol upregulated hepatic GSH and SOD level and downregulated hepatic CYP2E1 protein level. Hepatic PPARγ and its target genes were upregulated by honokiol. Furthermore, honokiol (10 μM) treatment in mouse peritoneal cells, RAW264.7 cells and ANA-1 cells led to M2 macrophage polarization, whereas a PPARγ antagonist, GW9662 abolished this effect of honokiol.
3::Rotor-based VF exhibited greater voltage variation than focal source-based VF in both the primary analysis (n = 8, 110±24% vs 55±32%, p = 0.02) and the secondary analysis (n = 18, 103±30% vs 67±34%, p = 0.009). Computational VF simulations also revealed greater voltage variation in rotors compared to focal sources (110±19% vs 33±16%, p = 0.001), and demonstrated that this variation was due to wavebreak, secondary rotor initiation, and rotor meander.
3::Among 523,808 reports of adverse drug reactions we identified 454 reports of gingival bleeding (0.09%). Most of them were ""serious"" (58.4%) and occurred in females (54.6%). The frequency of gingival bleeding increased with age. The most frequently ""suspected"" drugs were antithrombotics (67.8%), particularly fluindione. Other drugs frequently involved were furosemide followed by paracetamol, amiodarone, amoxicillin, paroxetine, ketoprofen, zolpidem, enalapril and ramipril. Thirty nine reports involved a drug-drug interaction with antithrombotics, mainly with antiinfectives.
3::Young peoples attitudes toward open communication between family members were more ambivalent and ambiguous than previous research suggests. Parental attempts at open communication were sometimes overlooked by young people, indicating that there may be differences between knowledge given and young people's acknowledgment of sensitive information. Some young people valued open communication as a signifier of the close relationships between family members, while others wanted to exercise more control over what they knew, when, and how. Young people's accounts challenged the positioning of young people as passive recipients of information. Young people were active in shaping family communication in their everyday lives, and deliberative acts of speaking or remaining silent were one way in which young people exercised care for themselves and others.'
3::During 2-year follow-up, the rates of all-cause death, cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and stent thrombosis were not significantly different between two groups. However, the rate of revascularization was significantly higher in domestic DES group, shown as higher rates of overall revascularization, target vessel revascularization (TVR), and target lesion revascularization (TLR) (9.7% vs 6.4%, P < 0.001; 5.6% vs 3.2%, P < 0.001; 4.5% vs 2.2%, P < 0.001, respectively). Accordingly, major adverse cardiac events (MACE) rate was significantly higher in domestic DES group (12.1% vs 8.5%, P < 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated that domestic DES was an independent risk factor of MACE (HR [95%CI]: 1.22 [1.05-1.41]), overall revascularization (HR [95%CI]: 1.29 [1.09-1.53]), TVR (HR [95%CI]: 1.54 [1.22-1.94]), and TLR (HR [95%CI]: 1.85 [1.41-2.42]). After propensity score matching, the rates of overall revascularization, TVR, and TLR were still significantly higher in domestic DES group, and domestic DES was still predictive of overall revascularization, TVR, and TLR in multivariate Cox regression analysis.
3::Autophagic flux was significantly (p<0.05) inhibited by MTA extracts, causing Notch degradation arrest. This resulted in the promotion of cell proliferation and inhibition of differentiation during the logarithmic phase of cell growth.
3::We demonstrate that RanBPM-mediated inhibition of HDAC6 is dependent on its association with HDAC6. We show that, while HDAC6 does not require RanBPM to associate with microtubules, RanBPM association with microtubules requires HDAC6. Additionally, we show that Twa1 (Two-hybrid-associated protein 1 with RanBPM) and MAEA (Macrophage Erythroblast Attacher), two CTLH complex members, also associate with α-tubulin and that muskelin, another component of the CTLH complex, is able to associate with HDAC6. Downregulation of CTLH complex members muskelin and Rmnd5A (Required for meiotic nuclear division homolog A) resulted in decreased acetylation of HDAC6 substrate α-tubulin. Finally, we demonstrate that the increased cell migration resulting from downregulation of RanBPM is due to the relief in inhibition of HDAC6 α-tubulin deacetylase activity.
3::The aged Nos2 KO mice had lower survival ratio (P=0.039) and liver coefficient (P=0.002) at the termination phase. Nos2 transcript level was obviously increased after PH in WT mice and undetected in the Nos2 KO mice. During LR, the expression at the transcript level of Cyclin D1, Cyclin A2 and Cyclin B1 and protein expression level of proliferation marker Ki67 and proliferation-associated transcription factors JNK1, NF-kB and STAT3 were decreased or delayed. The expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, CASPASE3, CASPASE9 and BAX, was increased in the Nos2 KO mice.
3::Multivariable models show that women who lived in communities with at least 1-5 years of a clinical social franchise intrauterine device (IUD) program had 4.770 higher odds of using a modern contraceptive method compared to women living in communities with no IUD program [CI: 3.739-6.084]. Townships where the reproductive health program had existed for at least 10 years had 1.428 higher odds of reporting modern method use compared to women living in townships where the programs had existed for less than 10 years [CI: 1.016-2.008].
3::The highest EFTh values (3.3±0.96 mm vs. 4.51±0.66 mm, P<.001) were observed in the abnormal aortic IMT group. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that aortic IMT was independently correlate with EFTh (β=0.423, P<.001). Moreover, EFTh was found to be associated with history of transient ischemic attack (r=.403, P<.001) and abnormal IMT (r=.643, P<.001) in bivariate analysis.
3::Each patient had temporal optic disc pallor and significant thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer in both eyes, although there was phenotypic variability among the patients that ranged from asymptomatic to moderately decreased visual acuity. For the affected brother and mother, the mean deviation values from SAP were within the normal range, whereas those from SWAP were significantly below the normal range (P < .05). The genetic analysis identified a newly discovered heterozygous deletion that encompasses exons 9-14 and revealed a breakpoint junction that directly connects intron 8 to intron 14.
3::All 34 autoimmune pancreatitis patients showed reduced pancreatic swelling. The main pancreatic duct dilation ( > 3 mm), the diameter of the main pancreatic duct, the capsule-like rim sign, and serum CA19-9 levels were significantly different between the autoimmune pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer patients (2.9% versus 69.2%, P < .01; 1.7 ± 1.6 mm versus 6.8 ± 5.0 mm, P < .01; 79.4% versus 0%, P < .01; 41.4 ± 79.0 U/mL versus 2079.1 ± 275.3 U/mL, P = .02).
3::Twenty or 40 days of treatment with BSYSC increased markedly PGP9.5 and GAP-43 levels, reduced p-Tau in the brain or spinal cord of mice with EAE. In addition, BSYSC elevated significantly the expression of KI67 and Nestin in the spinal cord 40 dpi. Further study showed that the activation of NogoA/NgR and RhoA/ROCK were suppressed by the presence of BSYSC.
3::M%NRAS was increased in 27.9% of cases. FISH revealed that chromosome 1 instability was the predominant mechanism of M%NRAS increase, with chromosome 1 polysomy observed in 28.6% of cases and intra-tumor cellular heterogeneity with copy number variations of chromosome 1/NRAS in 23.8%. Acquired copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was less frequent (19%). However, most samples with high M%NRAS had only one copy of NRAS locus surrounding regions suggesting a WT allele loss. Clinical characteristics and survival of patients with either <60% or ≥60% of M%NRAS were not different.
3::We discovered a core-cluster of 30 miRNAs that were highly expressed in all the cases and a cluster of 993 miRNAs that were uniformly absent in all cases. Another 1022 miRNA were variably present in the samples reflecting heterogeneity between tumors. We explored mRNA targets, pathways and biological processes affected by some of these miRNAs. We propose that the core-cluster of 30 miRs represent miRNA machinery common to all Rb, and affecting most pathways considered hallmarks of cancer. In this core, we identified miR-3613 as a potential and critical down regulatory hub, because it is highly expressed in all the samples and its potential mRNA targets include at least 36 tumor suppressor genes, including RB1. In the variably expressed miRNA, 36 were differentially expressed between males and females. Some of the potential pathways targeted by these 36 miRNAs were associated with hormonal production.
3::Overall, 180 infertile couples participated in the three groups. There was a significant higher mean score for hope in husbands compared to wives in the normal infertile group (P=0.046). Husbands in the normal infertile group also had a significantly higher mean score for pathway (P=0.032). The frequency of anxiety significantly differed in female subjects (P=0.028). In the normal infertile group, the anxiety distribution significantly differed between wives and husbands (P=0.006). There was a significantly different stress frequency in male subjects (P=0.048). In the embryo donation group, stress significantly differed between wives and husbands (P=0.002). In the normal infertile group, stress also significantly differed between wives and husbands (P=0.05).
3::Increased ORs for all users were observed. In the case-control study, the highest odds were seen among newly initiated zolpidem-only users involved in single-vehicle crashes (adjusted OR 2.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-4.24), followed by frequent combined zolpidem and zopiclone users [adjusted OR 2.20; CI 1.21-4.00]. In the case-crossover, newly initiated treatment with zolpidem or zopiclone showed an increased risk that was highest in the 2 weeks after the start of the treatment (OR 2.66; 95% CI 1.04-6.81).
3::We included a group with no DD (n=649), a group with grade 1 DD (n=2875), and those with grades 2 and 3 (n=1357) who had normal ejection fraction. The prevalence of grade 2 or 3 DD with preserved ejection fraction was 25%; 95% CI: 24-26. The absolute change of ace-inhibitor use before and after the echocardiogram increased by 14, 19, 23, 27 in patients without DD, those with grade 1, grade 2 or 3 asymptomatic and grade 2 or 3 symptomatic, respectively. The use of β-blocker, statin, and diuretic had similar trends.
3::HucMSC-CM significantly reduced the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased the activity of glutathione (GSH) induced by UUO. Moreover, CM significantly reduced the expression of TGF-β1, α-SMA, TNF-α and Collagen-I in UUO kidney, promoted the proliferation of RTEs and inhibited its apoptosis. In addition, the increased expression of E-cadherin also reflects the effective improvement of renal interstitial fibrosis.
3::During the 14-month study period, 1334 radial PCIs were attempted. Twenty-six patients switched to femoral at an early stage, while 76 encountered radial spasm and underwent successful BAT in 69 cases (91%), giving a total crossover rate to femoral of 33/1334 (2.5%). Utilizing BAT rather than a femoral puncture reduced our institutions radial-femoral crossover rate from 7.6% to 2.5% (P<.01), which is also significantly lower than the radial-femoral crossover rate in the 12 months before BAT implementation (6.1%; P<.01). Mean procedure times were similar for those requiring BAT compared with conventional radial access (51.3 ± 21.3 min vs 47.9 ± 23.7 min; P=.23), and those crossing straight to femoral (BAT not attempted) (60.7 ± 31.9 min; P=.10). Mean first device/balloon time for the BAT-assisted primary PCI cases (22.6 ± 9.4 min) was similar to cases that had radial difficulties and converted to femoral without attempting BAT (25.8 ± 13.4 min; P=.54).'
3::SLE patients had more MPs and IgG positive MPs than controls, however, β2 GPI-positive MPs were higher in controls. We observed less β2 GPI-positive MPs among aPL/anti-β2 GPI positive patients, compared to aPL/anti-β2 GPI negative patients and controls (roughly 2 times). β2 GPI levels in plasma did not differ with aPL/anti-β2 GPI status in patients, however controls had slightly higher levels of β2 GPI compared to aPL/anti-β2 GPI positive patients. In vitro experiments revealed that β2 GPI preferentially binds to PS positive MPs.
3::The A allele was significantly associated with sperm abnormality in our population [(P<0.001, odds ratios (OR) 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.31]. In addition, the A allele was also associated with azoospermia (P<0.001, OR (95% CI)=2.484), oligospermia (P=0.005, OR (95% CI)=2.51) and teratospemia (P<0.001, OR (95% CI)=3.385) but not with asthenoteratospermia (P=0.623).
3::Fifteen participants were recruited. The mean gray scale US echo intensity distribution obtained was 41.9. A paired t test of the global mean echo intensity value obtained for each image from the US operators did not show any significant difference (P = .77). A t test was performed, comparing the echo intensity of the group of patients with neck pain and healthy control participants, and the difference was found to be significant (P = .052). The median blob area was 2.71. The quartile range for the blob area was 1.72 for the 25th percentile to 4.90 for the 75th percentile.
3::Social service professionals perceived fathers more negatively than did other professionals. Even though male professionals perceived fathers more negatively, they felt more confident working with them than did their female counterparts. Positive perceptions of fathers were associated with more favourable attitudes towards including them in family interventions, and this association was mediated by the professionals perceptions of their own self-efficacy.'
3::Eight guidelines were identified, two of which were updates. Lowest scoring AGREE II domains across all guidelines were rigour (6/8 poor, one fair, one average) and applicability (4/8 poor, one fair, three average). Two out of the three highest scoring guidelines were developed using AGREE II. No guideline fully met each IOM criterion and all raised at least one red flag indicative of potential bias. One updated guideline did not address seven of 16 items on CheckUp and the other did not address four. Patient involvement in guideline development was minimal.
3::The calf had a dull kinky coat with mild hypotrichosis, and teeth with brown staining and enamel defects. Histological examination of skin biopsies was compatible with a follicular dysplasia. Radiography and computed tomography revealed thickening of the skull bones and large pulp cavities with a marked thinning of enamel affecting all teeth. A de novo germline mutation affecting the distal-less homeobox gene (DLX3) was identified. The 10 bp frameshift mutation in exon 3 of the bovine DLX3 gene is predicted to replace the second C-terminal transactivation domain of the wild-type protein by a recoded peptide of 99 amino acids without any sequence similarity.
3::Females with unexplained infertility had significantly lower levels of KP when compared with those with male factor infertility (176.69 ± 5.03 vs. 397.6 ± 58.2, P=0.001). Clinical pregnancy was observed in 28 (23%) females of which 17 (71%) had a female cause of infertility. In the non-pregnant group of 66 (53%) females, common cause of infertility was unexplained 56(85%). A weak positive correlation of KP levels with fertilized oocytes and endometrial thickness was observed (P=0.04 and 0.01 respectively).
3::One patient (1%) had RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) complete response (CR), 13 patients (16.5%) experienced a partial response (PR), and 28 (35%) stable disease (SD). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.8 months (range 2.63-3.83), with 24% of patients displaying PFS >5 months. Median growth modulation index (GMI) was 0.85 (range 0-15.61) and 32.5% of patients had GMI >1.33. KRAS exon 2 mutations were found in 38.5% of patients, and among the 78 patients with known KRAS status, those with wild-type tumors had longer PFS than those with mutated tumors (3.80 [95% CI 2.80-5.03] vs. 2.13 months [95% CI 1.77-2.87], respectively, p = 0.001). Median overall survival (OS) was 7.83 months (range 7.17-9.33) for all patients, and patients with KRAS wild-type tumors had longer OS than those with mutated tumors (7.83 [95% CI 7.33-10.80] vs. 7.18 months [95% CI 5.63-9.33], respectively, p = 0.06).
3::Excellent interexaminer reliability of clinician judgement, ABO-DI and PAR index was demonstrated by the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (rho= 0.995, 0.990 and 0.964, respectively). Both the ABO-DI and US-PAR index showed good correlation with clinician judgement (r=.700 and r=.707, respectively). There was variability among the different Angle classifications: the ABO-DI showed the highest correlation with clinician judgement in Class II patients (r=.780), whereas the US-PAR index showed the highest correlation with clinician judgement in Class III patients (r=.710). Both indices demonstrated the lowest correlations with clinician judgement in Class I patients.
3::Forty-three CSP cases after unsuccessful curettage treatment were successfully treated by operative hysteroscopy. The estimated intraoperative blood loss was 20.00 (10.00-500.00) mL, the hysteroscopic operating time was 20.00 (15.00-45.00) min, the decline of serum β-hCG the day after surgery was 71.91 ± 14.05%, the total hospitalisation time was 7.87 ± 2.26 days, the medical cost was 13,682.71 ± 3553.77 China Yuan (CNY), the time of bleeding after surgery was 7.42 ± 2.48 days, and the time of serum β-hCG resolution after surgery was 13.84 ± 9.83 days. Follow-up after discharge demonstrated that there were no severe complications for any patients.
3::Only one of 65 studied preterm neonates had normal vitamin D level. Neonates with RDS had significantly lower mean serum 25(OH)D level than controls (10.6 vs. 13.9 ng/dl) (p value =0.028). Neonates with severe 25(OH)D deficiency developed more BPD than those with moderate deficiency (29.4 vs. 8.7%) but did not reach significant level (p value =0.08). There is no correlation between serum 25(OH)D level and duration of mechanical ventilation. Logistic regression analysis shows that low serum 25(OH)D level is an independent risk factor for RDS.
3::With the metaphysis included, mimicking osteoarthritis, the errors of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were 2.9° (± 2.3°), 4.0° (± 3.3°), 1.0 mm (± 0.8 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.6 mm), 0.7 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 1.0 mm (± 0.7 mm), respectively. With the metaphysis excluded, mimicking a fracture of the surgical neck, the errors of prediction for retroversion, inclination, height, radius of curvature and posterior and medial offset of the head of the humerus were 3.8° (± 2.9°), 3.9° (± 3.4°), 2.4 mm (± 1.9 mm), 1.3 mm (± 0.9 mm), 0.8 mm (± 0.5 mm) and 0.9 mm (± 0.6 mm), respectively.
3::Seven hundred forty-three women underwent FP. Twenty-one percent (n = 154) were taking long-term CHC (≥6 months). AFC suppression was more likely with CHC use (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.4, P = 0.011). The BREAK group (n = 79) stopped CHC for an average of 4 months. AFC improvement started at 1 month and plateaued at approximately 6- to 7-month break. The BREAK group had approximately twice as many oocytes per initial AFC as NO BREAK (2.8 ± 3.8 vs. 1.4 ± 0.9, P < 0.001).
3::A total of 264 patients were recruited and data from 230 (88%) were available for the primary analysis. Intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome measure of a visual analogue score for pain on the first post-operative day, prior to physiotherapy, was similar in both groups. The mean difference was -0.7 (95% confidence interval (CI) -5.9 to 4.5; p = 0.834). The periarticular group used less morphine in the first post-operative day compared with the femoral nerve block group (74%, 95% CI 55 to 99). The femoral nerve block group reported 39 adverse events, of which 27 were serious, in 31 patients and the periarticular group reported 51 adverse events, of which 38 were serious, in 42 patients up to six weeks post-operatively. None of the adverse events were directly attributed to either of the interventions under investigation.
3::At a mean follow-up of 20 months (6 to 52), a total of 15 lateral hinge fractures (18.3%) were identified. A sufficient osteotomy, in which both anterior and posterior tibial cortices were involved with extension into the lateral aspect of the plateau in relation to an anteroposterior line tangential to the medial edge of the fibular head in the CT axial plane, was seen in 48 knees (71.6%) in those without a lateral hinge fracture and in seven (46.7%) in those with a lateral hinge fracture. An osteotomy which ended above the level of the fibular head was seen in nine (13.4%) of the knees without a lateral hinge fracture and seven (46.7%) of the those with a lateral hinge fracture. There was a significant relationship between the absence of a lateral hinge fracture and both a sufficient osteotomy and one whose endpoint was at the level of the fibular head (p = 0.0451 and p = 0.0214, respectively).
3::The mean age of COPD patients was 59.29 ± 10.3 years. Serum levels of MDA and iron were significantly higher in COPD patients compared to controls (5.21 ± 1.9 vs. 0.71 ± 0.29 nmol MDA/ml, P = 0.0001 and 69.85 ± 85.49 vs. 79.32 ± 24.39 μg/dl, P = 0.0001, respectively). Mean level of all antioxidant enzymes catalase, SOD, and copper were significantly diminished in cases when compared to control population (P = 0.001). Levels of MDA and iron were found to be significantly elevated in higher Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) classes (III, IV) when compared to lower GOLD Classes (I, II). The levels of serum antioxidants were significantly depleted in higher GOLD grades too. COPD patients who were male and smoked had significantly higher levels of oxidants and depleted antioxidant levels compared to female and nonsmoking compatriots. Serum MDA levels negatively correlated with forced expiratory volume 1 s and forced vital capacity (r = -0.19 and r = -0.21, P ≤ 0.01). The presence of a cough significantly correlated with higher levels of MDA and iron (P = 0.001). The levels of MDA negatively correlated with SOD and catalase levels.
3::Type-I included 53 patients with unilateral dislocation, in which 25 (category A) had no pelvic obliquity or spinal deformity, 19 (category B) had pelvic obliquity with a compensated spinal curvature and nine (category C) had pelvic obliquity and decompensated spinal degenerative changes. Type-II included 25 patients with one dislocated and one dysplastic hip, in which there were eight of category A, 15 of category B and two of category C. Pre-operatively, there were significant differences between the anatomical and functional LLD in type-IB (p = 0.005) and -IC (p < 0.001), but not in type-IA, -IIA or -IIB. Post-operatively, bony LLD increased significantly in types-IB, -IC and -IIB, whereas functional LLD decreased significantly in each type except for IIA. The mean functional LLD decreased from 30.7 mm (standard deviation (sd) 18.5) pre-operatively to 6.2 mm (sd 4.4) post-operatively and the mean anatomical LLD improved from 35.8 mm (sd 19.7) pre-operatively to 12.4 mm (sd 8.3) post-operatively.
3::The change in the UC-DAI (mean±standard deviation) in the per-protocol set was -2.6±2.47 in the multimatrix mesalazine 4.8 g/day group (n=134) and -1.8±2.64 in the pH-dependent-release mesalazine 3.6 g/day group (n=129). The difference in the mean change between the 2 groups was -0.7 (two-sided 95% confidence interval, -1.3 to -0.1). The noninferiority of multimatrix mesalazine 4.8 g/day to pH-dependent-release mesalazine 3.6 g/day was verified within the noninferiority margin (1.1). The superiority of multimatrix mesalazine 4.8 g/day to pH-dependent-release mesalazine 3.6 g/day was also investigated and confirmed in the full analysis set, according to the study protocol. In subgroup analyses, the effectiveness of multimatrix mesalazine 4.8 g/day was consistent in all subgroups. There was no difference in safety between the 2 treatment groups.
3::The two patient groups demographic and clinical characteristics were similar (P > 0.05). Progression-free survival was significantly more pronounced in the HIPEC (25.1 months) patients compared to the control group (20 months) (P = 0.024) and there was a decreased risk of disease progression accorded to the patients treated with HIPEC (HR 2.1028; 95% CI 1.2941-3.4167; P = 0.0027). However, we did not discern any HIPEC related overall survival advantages (P = 0.29).'
3::Among 184,161 patients with newly diagnosed AF (age 70 ± 11 years; 1.7% women; CHA2DS2-VASc score 2.6 ± 1.7), 40% received cardiology care and 60% received primary care only. After adjustment for covariates, cardiology care was associated with reductions in stroke (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86 to 0.96; p < 0.001) and death (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.91; p < 0.0001) and increases in hospitalizations for AF/supraventricular tachycardia (HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.35 to 1.42; p < 0.0001) and myocardial infarction (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.05; p < 0.04). The propensity-matched cohort had similar results. In mediation analysis, oral anticoagulation prescription within 90 days of diagnosis may have mediated reductions in stroke but did not mediate reductions in survival.
3::The relative change in mean vessel area was significantly greater with the BVS compared to the DES (6.7 ± 12.6% vs. 2.9 ± 11.5%; p = 0.003); the relative change in mean lumen area was significantly different between the 2 arms (1.4 ± 19.1% vs. -1.9 ± 10.5%, respectively; p = 0.031). Multivariate analysis indicated that use of the BVS, female sex, balloon-artery ratio >1.25, expansion index ≥0.8, previous percutaneous coronary intervention, and higher level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were independent predictors of expansive remodeling. Furthermore, in the BVS arm, necrotic core pre-procedure was an independent determinant of expansive remodeling.
3::A total of 160 patients were finally assessed. Seventy-eight patients belonged to study group and 82 in the control group. Baseline characteristics were similar and well matched in both groups. Mean age was 39.9 ± 15.8 years in the study group and 42.8 ± 12.8 in the control group and majority were female patients in both groups. At the end of 4 weeks, it was observed that the study group patients who received montelukast had better forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) improvement by 21% (0.21 L) as compared to the control group (P < 0.0033). It was also observed that there was a better improvement in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at 2 weeks (0.4 L/s, 12%) and at 4 weeks (0.9 L/s, 23%) as compared to the control group (P < 0.0376 and P < 0.0003 respectively). There was no difference in forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio and relapse rates between the two groups. No serious adverse effects were observed during the study.
3::A total of 12,804 patients from FRANCE TAVI and 4,165 patients from FRANCE 2 were included in this analysis. The median age of patients was 84.6 years, and 49.7% were men. FRANCE TAVI participants were older but at lower surgical risk (median logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation [EuroSCORE]: 15.0% vs. 18.4%; p < 0.001). More than 80% of patients in FRANCE TAVI underwent transfemoral TAVR. Transesophageal echocardiography guidance decreased from 60.7% to 32.3% of cases, whereas more recent procedures were increasingly performed in hybrid operating rooms (15.8% vs. 35.7%). Rates of Valve Academic Research Consortium-defined device success increased from 95.3% in FRANCE 2 to 96.8% in FRANCE TAVI (p < 0.001). In-hospital and 30-day mortality rates were 4.4% and 5.4%, respectively, in FRANCE TAVI compared with 8.2% and 10.1%, respectively, in FRANCE 2 (p < 0.001 for both). Stroke and potentially life-threatening complications, such as annulus rupture or aortic dissection, remained stable over time, whereas rates of cardiac tamponade and pacemaker implantation significantly increased.
3::In the period April 2013 to December, 110 cases were reported, 71 nominal and 39 non-nominal. The annual incidence increased from 9.0 cases per 100,000 to 13.4. Of the cases investigated, 63 were women and 8 men. The mean age was 40.8 years (38.5-43.1 95% CI). 58 cases (81.7%) corresponded to teachers. In 22 of the 71 nodules (31%) and 9 coincidences were notified as an occupational disease. We found a greater presence of nodules in professionals with extra work use of voice (OR 4.2 IC 1.3-14.3) and better evolution of pathologies other than VN (OR = 2.5 CI 1.1-5.8 ). The suspicion was confirmed as occupational in 54 cases (positive predictive value 76.1%).
3::Seventy-four participants (57 women [77.1%], 17 men [22.9%]) of 97 completed the program (76.3% completion rate). Body weight (P<.001); percentage of body fat (P<.001); fat mass (P<.001); body mass index (P<.001); waist circumference (P<.001); blood levels of high-density lipoprotein (P=.035), low-density lipoprotein (P=.011), and glucose (P=.008); serum triglyceride levels (P=.019); blood pressure (systolic P=.028; diastolic, P=.001); and maximal oxygen consumption (P<.001) improved from baseline to 1 year after the intervention. Lean body mass (P=.111) and total cholesterol (P=.053) did not improve.
3::The mean ALT change at 12 weeks was -10.3 ± 11.7 and -3.2 ± 17.6 U/L in the canagliflozin vs. placebo group in the high ALT subgroup (P = 0.0206); no significant difference was shown in the low ALT subgroup (Study 1). In both ALT subgroups, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight were significantly reduced in the canagliflozin vs. placebo group (all P < 0.0001). The mean change in ALT at 52 weeks was -16.0 ± 18.8 U/L in the high ALT subgroup (P < 0.0001, Study 2). The incidence of AEs or serious AEs in the high ALT subgroup in the canagliflozin group was similar to that in the placebo group (Study 1) or low ALT subgroup (Studies 1 and 2).
3::Immediately after the intervention, there were moderate effects on both near, intermediate and distal measures of language performance. At delayed follow-up (7 months after the intervention), these reliable effects remained for the distal measures.
3::On multivariate analysis of the unmatched cohort accounting for demographics and confounders, no significant difference in overall medical complications was identified between groups (odds ratio = 0.799, P = 0.495). Propensity matching corrected for all significantly distributed comorbidities, except for alcohol, which remained associated with the smoking group (P = < 0.001). In the matched population, there were no significant differences in complication rates between the two groups. Pack-year data was available for 340 patients. These cases were subdivided into cohorts with < 50 (n = 204) and 51+ (n = 136) pack-years. Postoperative pneumonia, ventilation for more than 48 hours, sepsis, and overall medical complications were associated with > 50 pack-years of smoking. After multivariate regression, sepsis and overall medical complications remained significant for the 51+ pack-year smoking cohort.
3::For every unit increase in workload burden, adherence to the ABCDE bundle decreased 53% (odds ratio [OR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28-0.79; P = .004). Bundle difficulty (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.08-1.07), perceived safety (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.10-2.65), confidence (OR, 0.37, 95% CI, 0.10-1.35), and perceived strength of evidence (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.14-3.35) were not associated with ABCDE bundle adherence. For every unit increase in perceived difficulty carrying out the bundle, adherence with early mobility was reduced 59% (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.19-0.90; P = .03). In addition, ABCDE bundle adherence (ie, ventilator bundle) was less than DE bundle adherence (ie, ventilator-free bundle) (97% vs 72%, z = 5.47; P < .001).
3::Course evaluations indicated student appreciation for the new content and practicum experiences provided. Students felt the new content to be essential in their development as expert practitioners.
3::Meditation demonstrated moderate strength for enhancing executive attention, F = 4.26 (1, 49), n(2) = .080, p = .044. Additional outcomes specific to the meditation group were reduced stress and increased mindfulness, F = 7.16 (2, 47), n(2) = .234, p = .002.
3::Serum levels of LPS were significantly elevated in the active CD group (P=0.003). Levels of IL-1β (P=0.002), IL-6 (P=0.003), and IL-17 (P<0.001) were lower in the CD groups. Serum TNF-α levels were increased in the active CD group. The CRP levels were elevated in the CD groups when compared to controls (P<0.001). The CD26 levels were lower in the CD groups than in the control group (P<0.001). Among the variables analyzed, there was a correlation between LPS and CRP (r=-0.53, P=0.016) in the CD groups.
3::Two shoulders (two patients) were revised and in two shoulders of two different patients, revision surgery was recommended. The mean CS increased from 23.3 (10 to 45) pre-operatively to 56.5 (26 to 81; p < 0.0001), but with a decrease in CS from 62.8 (38 to 93) to 56.5 (26 to 81) between medium- and long-term follow-up (p = 0.01). Without revision surgery, 18 patients (95%) rated their result as good or very good. The mean radiolucent line score for the glenoid components increased from 1.8 (0 to 6) to 8.2 (2 to 18) between medium- and long-term follow-up (p < 0.001).
3::During the study, 27 silicone Y-stents were placed. The mean (standard deviation) age of the study population (85.2% males) was 57.7 (13.5) years. The stents were placed for airway obstruction in 77.8% and TEF in 29.6% of the patients. The most common underlying disease was carcinoma of the esophagus. The degree of airway obstruction was grade 3-4 in 18 subjects, and respiratory failure was encountered in 18 subjects. The stent was deployed successfully in all the subjects. No deaths were encountered during stent placement. Most subjects had rapid relief of symptoms following the procedure. Excessive secretions and mucostasis were the most common stent-related complications followed by the development of granulation tissue. The systematic review yielded nine studies (338 subjects with airway obstruction and/or TEF). The most common indication for silicone Y-stent placement was tracheobronchial obstruction and TEF due to malignancy. Benign disorders that necessitated stent placement included postintubation tracheal stenosis, airway malacia, and others. The stent was successfully placed in 98% with only one periprocedural death. Granulation tissue formation and mucostasis were the most common stent-related complications.
3::A total of 127 fractures were identified in 122 patients. The mean age was 72.8 years (16 to 101) and 92 of the patients (75%) were female. A consultant performed the operation in 85 of the cases, (67%) with the remainder performed under direct consultant supervision. In total 107 patients (84%) were allowed to bear full weight immediately. The rate of clinical and radiological union was 81/85 (95%) and only four fractures of 127 (3%) fractures required re-operation for failure of surgery. The 30-day, three- and 12-month mortality rates were 6 (5%), 17 (15%) and 25 (22%), respectively.
3::Forty-one (63.1%) patients were males, whereas 24 (36.9%) were females. Age range is between 5 and 75 years, average of 30.8 years. Lower limb involvement was recorded in 40 (61.5%) patients, with remaining 25 (38.5%) patients in upper limbs. 28 (43.1%) patients had benign lesion, whereas 37 (56.9%) were malignant. Giant cell tumor (GCT) was the most frequent benign tumor (50%) while osteogenic sarcomas top the list on the malignant variety (32.4%). The most commonly affected bones were tibia, carpal-metacarpal, and femur in that order.
3::Fourteen out of 25 patients presented with singular cardiac mass (56%), whereas ten patients (40%) presented with multifocal and one patient with disseminated cardiac metastases. Twelve patients presented with endocardial (48%), eight with myocardial and two with pericardial metastases. Most frequent site involved in endocardial metastases was the right atrium (67%) followed by the right ventricle (33%). There seems to be a correlation between histological subtype and location of cardiac metastasis. Median survival after diagnosis of cardiac metastases was 8 months, with no significant difference regarding the localization of metastases within the heart.
3::An increase in the number of physicians at both county hospitals and PHCs was associated with increased outpatient visits by DM patients, particularly more physicians at PHCs. With increased numbers of physicians at PHCs, outpatient visits among residents with DM in rural and western areas of China increased more than those in urban and eastern areas. More physicians at PHCs had a positive impact on improving the likelihood of outpatient visits at PHCs. The positive influence of increasing the number of physicians available to DM patients in rural and western areas was greater than that for urban and eastern DM patients.
3::27 patients (20.93%) used topical tacrolimus in proper amounts (A/E: 0.8-1.2). However, 86 patients (66.67%) underused topical tacrolimus; 16 (12.40%) patients overused topical tacrolimus. Decreases in EASI scores between baseline and 2 weeks of follow-up in each group (under-amount, proper amount, over-amount) were 1.64, 4.65 and 4.21, respectively. Treatment efficacy increased in accordance with application amount. Further, TIS, IGA, PGA, VAS for Itch and DLQI scores improved concomitantly, exhibiting similar tendencies.
3::Of the 2,058 UC patients included in the analysis, a positive family history of IBD was confirmed in 31 patients (1.5%), 24 (77.4%) of whom had only first-degree relatives affected. All the affected relatives had UC and none had Crohns disease. Among first-degree relatives, siblings were found to have the highest prevalence of IBD (53.3%), followed by parents (26.7%).'
3::We found that while the work of ASHAs led to some positive health changes in the community, thus providing them with a sense of self-worth and motivation, community norms and beliefs as well as health system attitudes and practices limited their capacity as community health workers.
3::Had the gatekeeping pilot programme worked as intended, it would incentivize both providers and patients to increase service utilization at primary care level, as well as establish and enhance two reinforcing feedback loops to shift balance towards primary care. However, a performance-based salary policy undermined the motivation for clinical primary care. Furthermore, the primary care providers suffered from three reinforcing feedback loops (related to primary care capacity, human resource sustainability, patients faith) that trapped primary care development in vicious cycles. At the interface between hospitals and primary care providers, there were also feedback loops exacerbating the existing hospital dominance. These feedback loops were intensified by the unintended consequences of concurrent policies (restrictions on technologies and medicines) and delayed reform in hospitals. Furthermore, the gatekeeping policy itself faced resistance to further development, due to the prevailing ineffective and ritualistic nature of gatekeeping, which formed a balancing loop.'
3::BCVA significantly improved after the loading phase and was maintained in the maintenance phase. CMT and CCT significantly reduced after the loading phase and were maintained throughout the follow-up period. The number of injections averaged 7.72 in the first year and 4.67 in the second year. The average number of polypoidal lesions per patient was 2.43 before treatment. In 32 patients (55.2%), polypoidal lesions regressed completely after the loading phase; these patients also needed significantly fewer injections compared to other patients. CCT at baseline was positively correlated with the decreased amount of CCT after 2 years and negatively correlated with the number of injections for 2 years.
3::Both fusion proteins bound specifically to target cells with high affinity. Furthermore, scFv13-ETA inhibited the proliferation of human cancer cell lines efficiently at low concentrations (IC50 values of 408 pM-7 nM) and induced apoptosis (40-85% of target cells). The bsscFv triggered dose-dependent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, resulting in the lysis of up to 23.9% A2058 cells, 18.0% MDA-MB-468 cells and 19.1% HL-60 cells.'
3::Demographic characteristics, health literacy and self-management efficacy have all significant effects on HRQL. Age, education level, self-management efficacy and health literacy were significantly related to the HRQL. The constructed model had a good fit for the data according to the model fit indices. Based on the model, health literacy (r = 0.604, p = 0.029) and Self-management efficacy (r = 0.714, p = 0.018) have a significant impact on HRQL. Demographic characteristics were inversely related to HRQL (r = -0.419, p = 0.007), but have a significant impact on health literacy (r = 0.675, p = 0.029) and self-management efficacy (r = 0.379, p = 0.029). At the same time, self-management efficacy was positively correlated to health literacy (r = 0.413, p < 0.01).
3::There was no statistically significant difference in NO and adrenomedullin levels, neither between the groups nor ADHD subtypes. A positive correlation between adrenomedullin and NO levels was found in both the case (r = 0.659) and the control groups (r = 0.494).
3::All comparative data are expressed as (V. Eld. vs Eld.) unless otherwise specified. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in the V. Eld. group (11.9% vs 6.1%), although this did not translate into a significant difference in cardiac mortality (6.3% vs 3.7%) or major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (16.2% vs 12.5%). The composite incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, definite/probable stent thrombosis, and TIMI major bleed was 4.7%, 1.4% 1.9%, and 6.4%, respectively with no significant difference between both cohorts.
3::Facilitating factors in the delivery of the intervention included intervention related factors such as: the content of the intervention, ongoing training and supervision, using a counselling manual, conducting counselling sessions in the local language (isiXhosa) and fidelity to the manual; counsellor factors included counsellors confidence and motivation to conduct the sessions; participant factors included older age, commitment and a desire to be helped. Barriers included contextual factors such as poverty, crime and lack of space to conduct counselling sessions and participant factors such as the nature of the participant's problem, young age, and avoidance of contact with counsellors. Fidelity ratings and dropout rates varied substantially between counsellors.'
3::Single-cell WGA products exhibited a significant sample-to-sample variability in amplified DNA quality as assessed by our 8-gene QC assay. Single-cell WGA products that passed the pre-analysis QC had lower amplification bias and improved aCGH/NGS performance metrics when compared to single-cell WGA products that failed the QC. Increasing the number of cellular input resulted in improved QC-scores overall, but a resultant WGA product that consistently passed the QC step required a starting cellular input of at least 20-cells. Our modified-WGA protocol effectively reduced this number, achieving reproducible high-quality WGA products from ≥5-cells as a starting template. A starting cellular input of 5 to 10-cells amplified using the modified-WGA achieved aCGH and NGS results that closely matched that of unamplified, batch genomic DNA.
3::Two thousand six hundred forty (0.5%) had Parkinsons disease, of whom only 7.4% had no other conditions compared with 22.9% of controls (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.43, 95% 0.38-0.49). The Parkinson's group had more conditions, with the biggest difference found for seven or more conditions (PD 12.1% vs. controls 3.9%; aOR 2.08 95% CI 1.84-2.35). 12 of the 31 physical conditions and five of the seven mental health conditions were significantly more prevalent in the PD group. 44.5% with Parkinson's disease were on five to nine repeat prescriptions compared to 24.5% of controls (aOR 1.40; 95% CI 1.28 to 1.53) and 19.2% on ten or more compared to 6.2% of controls (aOR 1.90; 95% CI 1.68 to 2.15).'
3::There were 64 adult patients who were studied with multiple rib fractures caused by blunt chest trauma. Of these patients, 54 (84.4%) were male and 10 (15.6%) were female. Motorcycle (popularly known as ""okada"") and tricycle (popularly known as keke napep) accidents significantly accounted for the majority of the multiple rib fractures, that is, in 50 (78.1%) of the patients. Before analgesic administration, no patient had a normal respiratory rate, but at 1 h following the administration of analgesic, 21 (32.8%) of patients recorded normal respiratory rates and there was a significant reduction in the number (10.9% vs. 39.1%) of patients with respiratory rates> 30 breaths/min. Before commencement of analgesic, no patient recorded up to 99% of oxygen saturation (SpO2) as measured by pulse oximeter, while 43.8% recorded SpO2of 96%. This improved after 1 h of administration of analgesics to SpO2of 100% in 18.8% of patients and 99% in 31.3% of patients and none recording SpO2of < 97% (P = 0.006). Before analgesia, no patient was able to achieve peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) value> 100% of predicted while only 9 (14.1%) patients were able to achieve a PEFR value in the range of 91%-100% of predicted value. One hour after analgesia, a total of 6 (9.4%) patients were able to achieve PEFR values> 100% predicted, while 35 (54.7%) patients achieved PEFR values in the range of 91%-100% predicted.
3::The mean age of participants was 48.3 ± 13.9 years and 50.6% were men. The ACA decreased with age whereas ICSA, IT, and IC increased with age. The ACA (P = 0.0001nasally and temporally), ICSA (P = 0.011 nasally, P = 0.027 temporally), IT750 (P = 0.001 nasally, P = 0.011 temporally), IT1500 (P = 0.002 nasally, P = 0.002 temporally), and IC (P = 0.059 nasally, P = 0.128 temporally) underwent statistically significant changes with increasing age. No significant difference was seen in parameters of different sex.
3::There were 172 AYA (Youth Centre = 109, VCT = 63) during 6 baseline weeks and 702 (Youth Centre = 454, VCT = 248) during 24 intervention weeks. CQI was associated with an immediate increase in the proportion of AYA with accurate knowledge of HIV transmission at Youth Centre: 18 vs. 63% [adjusted risk difference (aRD) 0.42,95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 0.63], and a trend at VCT: 38 vs. 72% (aRD 0.30, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.63). CQI was associated with an increase in the proportion of AYA with accurate HIV prevention knowledge in VCT: 46 vs. 61% (aRD 0.39, 95% CI 0.02-0.76), but not Youth Centre (P = 0.759). In VCT, CQI showed a trend towards increased intent to retest (4.0 vs. 4.3; aRD 0.78, 95% CI -0.11 to 1.67), but not at Youth Centre (P = 0.19). CQI was not associated with changes in AYA satisfaction, which was high during baseline and intervention at both clinics (P = 0.384, P = 0.755). HCW satisfaction remained high during intervention and baseline (P = 0.746).
3::Among 15 456 enumerated adolescents, 11 175 (72.3%) accepted the intervention. HCT uptake was 80.6% (8707/10 809) and was similar by sex. Adolescents that knew their HIV-positive status increased almost three-fold, from 75 to 210. Following visits from community HIV care providers, knowledge of HIV status increased from 27.6% (3007/10 884) to 88.5% (9636/10 884). HCT uptake was associated with community, age, duration since previous HIV test; other household members accepting HCT, having an HIV-positive household member, circumcision, and being symptomatic for STIs.
3::There was strong concordance across methods and countries based on the three triangulation parameters: product, provider and service characteristics. HIVST was highly accepted by young people, if provided at no or very low cost. Young people expressed mixed views on oral-fluid tests, weighing perceived benefits with accuracy concerns. There was an expressed lack of trust in health providers and preference for lay community distributors. HIVST addressed youth-specific barriers to standard HIV testing, with home-based distribution considered convenient. Issues of autonomy, control, respect and confidentiality emerged as key qualitative themes.
3::This study investigated the preclinical, clinical, human and animal model studies on honey and diabetes mellitus and found that honey decreases the fasting serum glucose, increases the sting C-peptide and 2-h postprandial C-peptide. Although, there is a dearth of data and literature also contrary discussed the use of honey in diabetic patients.
3::The median EQ-5D-3L score was 0.71 (interquartile range (IQR) 0.44 to 0.79) which is worse than the national average in the United States of 0.85 (p < 0.001). Anxiety (median: 55 (IQR 49 to 61), p = 0.031) and pain (median: 61 (IQR 56 to 68), p < 0.001) were also worse than the national average in the United States (50), while depression was not (median: 52 (IQR 38 to 57), p = 0.513). Patients who underwent a primary resection had better QOL and less anxiety, depression and pain compared with those who underwent resection for recurrent or residual disease. The one- and five-year probabilities were 0.96 and 0.74 for survival, 0.07 and 0.25 for tumour recurrence, and 0.02 and 0.16 for developing distant metastasis. A total of 25 local complications occurred in 20 patients (42%), and there were 50 systemic and other complications in 25 patients (52%) within 90 days.
3::A total of 19 patients were randomised to non-operative (n = 8) or operative (n = 11; tension-band wiring (n = 9), plate (n = 2)) management. The trial was stopped prematurely as the rate of complications (nine out of 11, 81.8%) in the operative group was considered to be unacceptable. There was, however, no difference in the mean DASH scores between the groups at all times. The mean score was 23 (0 to 59.6) in the non-operative group and 22 (2.5 to 57.8) in the operative group, one year after the injury (p = 0.763). There was no significant difference between groups in the secondary outcome measures of the Broberg and Morrey Score or the Mayo Elbow Score at any time during the one year following injury (all p ≥ 0.05).
3::Out of 120 patients, 29 patients were HAP and 91 patients were VAP. Mortality was 60% (72), and development of VAP and requirement of mechanical ventilation showed significant association with mortality (P < 0.00001). Most common organism causing HAP was Staphylococcus aureus (43.4%) and VAP was Klebsiella pneumoniae (49%). Maximum antibiotic sensitivity was found to piperacillin + tazobactam (58.8%), followed by imipenem (49.5%) and meropenem (41.8%), whereas maximum antibiotic resistance was found to cefepime (95.1%), followed by ceftazidime and amoxicillin (91.2%).
3::In a well-fitting multivariable analysis (R(2) = 0.71), variables significantly associated with a higher global satisfaction score were ""sufficient information given about treatment"" (β = 0.86, 95% CI 0.01-1.70, p = 0.047), ""sufficient explanation of risks and benefits of surgery"" (β = 1.26, 95% CI 0.18-2.34, p = 0.020), ""absence of night-time noise"" (β = 1.35, 95% CI 0.56-2.14, p = 0.001) and ""confidence and trust in nurses"" (β = 1.51, 95% CI 0.54-2.49, p = 0.003).
3::One-fifth of admissions were due to trauma. 58% of admissions were male. Weekends accounted for 49% of admissions. Road traffic injuries (RTI) (66%) and toxin ingestion (TI) (17%) contributed the majority of admissions. Children aged 0-4 years accounted for 45%, 5-9 years 39%, and 10-15 years 16% of admissions. The mortality rate was 9.0% with RTI accounting for 64%. 64% of mortalities occurred in the 0-4 year cohort. Mean age of survivors (5.8 years) was significantly higher than non-survivors (3.4 years) (p < 0.05). 89% of all children required invasive ventilation on PICU admission. Mean length of ventilation in non-survivors (10.2 days) was significantly longer than survivors (4.5 days) (p < 0.05).
3::IL-1β increased inflammatory gene expression and NF-κB activation in primary murine-mixed glia, enriched astrocyte, and BMEC cultures. Although IL-1β elicited minimal changes in inflammatory gene expression and did not induce the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in isolated microglia, these cells were more robustly activated by IL-1β when co-cultured with astrocytes and/or BMEC. We observed a polarized endothelial response to IL-1β, because the application of IL-1β to the abluminal endothelial surface produced a more complex microglial inflammatory response than that which occurred following luminal IL-1β exposure.
3::Two patients were excluded since they did not have adequate measurements of CRP and IL6. Among the remaining patients, 25 (52%) were ≥70 years old. Nine (19%), 12 (25%) and 12 (25%) patients had low serum albumin (<3.0 g/dl), elevated CRP (≥70 mg/l) and elevated IL6 (≥24 pg/ml), respectively. Age was a significant predictor of non-home discharge (p=0.01). Low serum albumin (<3.0 g/dl) was a predictor of death within 6 month (p=0.03). Elevated CRP (≥70 mg/l) was a predictor of non-home discharge (p=0.02), death within 6 months (p=0.02), death within 12 months (p=0.04), and longer hospital stay (p=0.01). Elevated IL6 (≥24 pg/ml) was a predictor of non-home discharge (p=0.002) and surgical complications (p=0.02), and also associated with longer hospital stay (p=0.03).
3::A total of 105 patients had transcatheter replacement and 121 had surgical replacement. Patients in the transcatheter group were older (median age, 81 vs 68 years; P < .001) and had more comorbid conditions (median Charlson Comorbidity Index, 3 vs 2; P < .001). Patients in the transcatheter group also had lower incidence (19% vs 21%; P = .65) and odds of delirium developing (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9; P = .03). Delirium was independently associated with a 3-fold higher mortality by 6 months (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3-8.8; P = .01).
3::Results showed that self-efficacy for coping with cancer can influence the effect of a Reiki treatment. Higher efficacious patients showed a more powerful effect of the Reiki intervention on both anxiety and mood than the low efficacious patients.
3::Altogether, 753 study subjects completed the trial per protocol (PP), 944 with violations (mITT), and the rest (n=301) were lost to follow-up (LTF). During the 6-month intervention, 331 subjects stopped smoking; 181 (18.2%) in the intervention arm and 150 (15.0%) in the placebo arm (OR=1.43; 95%CI=1.09-1.88); p=0.010). In the PP group, 170 (45.3%) quitted smoking in the intervention arm compared to 134 (35.4%) in the placebo arm (OR=1.51, 95%CI=1.12-2.02; p=0.006). In multivariate (Poisson regression) model, decreased level of smoking pleasure (p=0.010) and ""smoking sensations changed"" were powerful independent predictors of quit events (IRR=12.01; 95%CI=1.5-95.6).
3::Experiences of the participants were divided into three main categories as follows: (1) disease shadow; (2) dual understanding of the effect of drug therapy consisting of two sub-categories known as 'perceived benefits,'' ''negative consequences''; and (3) facing the disease that includes the two subcategories of ''Compatibility'' and ''Negligence and denial''.'
3::For surgical specimens, vectors displaying PFW and SYE improved transduction efficiency by 4.4- and 4.3-fold, respectively. The SYE-displaying vector was >2-fold more efficient for all seven cases, whereas the PFW-displaying vector increased efficiency in two out of four cases. For ascites samples, both vectors increased gene-transduction efficiency of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-positive ascites cells by >2-fold in two out of five cases.
3::In the group of rats subjected to PT, a significantly higher progesterone level was observed. The highest progesterone level was noted in the low-intensity PT group. An increase in apoptosis of MNU-induced tumor cells was also demonstrated in the PT groups.
3::A total of 1,150 questionnaires were collected, excluding the participants with missing values in the CTS1. Finally, 1,078 were included in the statistical analyses. Data of 1,078 women were divided into two parts. In the first halved sample (n=578), an exploratory factor analysis was conducted for the CTS1 items after exluding nine items with extremely low prevalence. It revealed 2-factor or 3-factor models. Then, we conducted a model comparison with the second halved sample (n=500), using confirmatory factor analysis. In terms of goodness-of-fit indeces, the 2-factor model was superior. Its subscales were Reasoning and Psycholosical Aggression.
3::The results showed that the three polymorphisms were not significantly associated with increased risk of lung cancer in the overall investigated population. Furthermore, when the analyses were stratified according to age, sex, status of smoking and drinking, pack-years of smoking and family history of lung cancer, there was also no significant association between these genotypes and increased lung cancer risk.
3::The expression of TSP1 was high in the mucosal-atrophy group and tended to be high in the Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) (+) and multiple cancer groups. The levels of CD36, STAT3 and TGFβR2 mRNA were significantly higher in the TSP1-high group. TSP1 signaling pathway was induced in multiple cancer or atrophy (+) or H. pylori (+) compared to cases with single cancer, atrophy (-) and H. pylori (-). Expression of proteins involved in the TSP1 signaling pathway in non-cancer tissues with multiple gastric cancers were higher than that with single gastric cancer.
3::Significantly higher total activity of ADH was found in sera of both, low-grade and high-grade bladder cancer patients. The diagnostic sensitivity for total ADH activity was 81.5%, specificity 98.1%, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were 97.4% and 92.3% respectively. Area under ROC curve for total ADH activity was 0.848.
3::Itraconazole suppressed proliferation of CaSki and HeLa cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, CaSki cells were more significantly affected by itraconazole than HeLa cells. The microarray analysis showed an 8-fold down-regulation in the expression of GLI1, WNT4 and WNT10A among itraconazole-treated CaSki cells. Moreover, the transcription of sterol carrier protein-2 and ATP-binding cassette transporter-1 was unaffected by itraconazole. Immunoblots showed suppression in β-catenin expression and Akt phosphorylation.
3::Findings indicate that 58.5 percent of Community Health Workers had good knowledge about causes of child abuse and 45 percent had good knowledge of the signs, symptoms and complications of child abuse. Their total knowledge was good (57%). The mean score of awareness (knowledge) was significant according to the variable of training participation (P=0.04). The participants had a favorable attitude toward dealing with child abuse (91.3 %); the mean score of attitude was significant according to the educational field (P<0.001) and their performance in dealing with child abuse was moderate and lower (94.3 %).
3::Plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were significantly decreased at day 8 (20.1±4.0 pg/ml vs. 9.1±1.8 pg/ml, p=0.0002). Patients whose plasma BNP level was reduced to <50% of the baseline at day 8 had a longer progression-free survival (PFS) than those with a less decrease (9.73 versus 2.63 months, p=0.00013). In multivariate Cox analysis, decrease of plasma BNP concentration was associated with a longer PFS (p=0.0022).
3::High levels of curcumin were measured in PBMCs (625.5 ng/g w.w. cell pellet or 7,297 pg/10(6) cells in dog and 353.7 ng/g w.w. cell pellet or 6,809 pg/10(6) cells in human) and in hepatocytes (414.5 ng/g w.w. cell pellet or 14,005 pg/10(6) cells in dog and 813.5 ng/g w.w. cell pellet or 13,780 pg/10(6) cells in human). Lower curcumin levels were measured in red blood cells (dog: 78.4 ng/g w.w. cell pellet or 7.2 pg/10(6) cells, human: 201.5 ng/g w.w. cell pellet or 18.6 pg/10(6) cells). A decrease in the medium concentration of curcumin was observed in red blood cells and hepatocytes, but not in PBMCs. Red blood cell levels of THC were ~5-fold higher in dog compared to human and similar between dog and human for hepatocytes and PBMCs. The ratio of THC to curcumin found in the red blood cell medium following incubation was 6.3 for dog compared to 0.006 for human, while for PBMCs and hepatocytes the ratio of THC to curcumin in the medium did not display such marked species differences.
3::IQM suppressed B16F10 melanoma growth in parallel with reduction of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) at the tumor site, caused by the down-regulation of CCL22 production by tumor-derived and splenic CD11b(+) cells. Subsequently, we investigated the antitumor or tumor-loading effects of splenic CD11b(+) cells on B16F10 melanoma growth in vivo. B16F10 melanoma growth was accelerated by splenic CD11b(+) cells from untreated mice, but was inhibited by splenic CD11b(+) cells from IQM-treated mice. Consistent with these results, Foxp3(+) Tregs were significantly decreased in tumors of mice implanted with both melanoma and splenic CD11b(+) cells from topical IQM-treated mice. Furthermore, intratumoral administration of anti-CCL22 antibody inhibited B16F10 melanoma growth by decreasing Treg recruitment at the tumor site.
3::Metastases of EL4-RFP were observed in the liver, ascites and bone marrow. Primary tumors were imaged in the spleen at the injection site. The fewest metastases were observed in the fatty liver. In addition, the fewest cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were observed in the fatty liver.
3::Mean tumor volume for LND+TMZ for the period between 6 and 26 days was reduced compared to TMZ alone (repeated measures ANOVA F (1, 8), p=0.006), suggesting a pronounced impact of LND on this phenomenon. TMZ and LND+TMZ produced median growth delays of 82 and 106 days, respectively.
3::The initially developed scale consisted of 60 items on a 5-point Likert scale, which reduced to 43 items following measurement of the face and content validity. The results of the exploratory factor analysis elicited 36 items and a seven-factor structure including motivational beliefs on vaginal delivery, social beliefs towards childbirth, motivational beliefs on cesarean delivery, personal beliefs, sources of information, catastrophic thinking and child birth experiences. Cronbachs alpha coefficient (0.80) confirmed the high internal consistency of the scale.'
3::Anthracimycin suppressed cell proliferation and motility and induced apoptosis in human HCC cell lines. Furthermore, anthracimycin had no effect on the enrichment of EpCAM-high liver cancer stem cells (CSCs), while fluorouracil dramatically enriched the CSCs with activation of the stemness-related genes EPCAM and SOX9 in HuH7 cells. Mechanistically, anthracimycin suppressed mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, and was most effective at inhibiting HCC cell proliferation with mTOR activation.
3::Systematic search of PubMed resulted in 12 studies discussing ALR in multiple types of cancer. More specifically, ALR appears to be up-regulated in malignant cells and tissues. Furthermore, treatment of cells with exogenous ALR shows an anti-apoptotic effect while silencing or inhibiting ALR decreases cell and tumor survival.
3::Three heterogeneous clusters of craniofacial patterns were obtained in relation to age: cluster 1 (41.9%) included patients aged 5-8 years with a skeletal Class I or mild Class II and hyperdivergent pattern; cluster 2 (45.3%) included patients aged 9-12 years with a Class II and hyperdivergent pattern; and cluster 3 (12.8%) included patients aged 7-8 years with a Class III and hyperdivergent pattern.
3::The 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of 65 pathologically PALN-positive patients who underwent PALN dissection (n=704) were 33.8% and 21.2%, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed the following poor prognostic factors: nodal involvement around the celiac axis (hazard ratio (HR)=4.04, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.55-9.63), tumor diameter of ≥120 mm (HR=3.37; 95% CI=1.18-9.63) and ≥3 PALNs involved (HR=2.24; 95% CI=1.21-4.15). Patients with none of these factors survived significantly longer than those with any of these factors (5-year OS=87.5% versus 9.3%, respectively; p<0.001).
3::Six patients were enrolled. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached at level 1. Oxaliplatin at 130 mg/m(2) combined with capecitabine at 2,000 mg/m(2)/day, b.i.d. had acceptable toxicity. No treatment-related death occurred. Most frequent drug-related adverse events during neoadjuvant G-XELOX were nausea and peripheral sensory neuropathy. One patient declined surgical resection, leaving five undergoing resection with curative intent, of whom four achieved pathological down-staging after neoadjuvant G-XELOX.
3::A total of 32 patients were enrolled in the study. Median duration of abiraterone treatment was 13.0 months (range=3.8-40.9 months). Median duration of abiraterone treatment before RT was 5.9 months (range=0.4-40.0 months), and 7.2 months after RT (range=0.1-29.7 months). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.6 months (95%CI=10.5-14.7) from the initiation of abiraterone treatment. From RT administration, PFS was 9.6 months (95%CI=6.4-12.9). Median overall survival (OS) since abiraterone initiation was 18.9 months (95%CI=4.7-33.0).
3::Patients in the study experienced more physical than mental adverse health outcomes, and the risk for mental problems was 2 or 3 times the rate expected. Adverse physical outcomes were common. One-quarter of patients remained significantly restricted; some had severe neurological impairments of the lower extremities. On cognitive tests, about half scored inconclusive or mildly impaired. Patients were often admitted to the hospital.
3::DM/TB co-morbidity was noted in 85 individuals and these made up 15.4% of the study population. The mean age was higher in DM patients with TB (43.4 ± 15.4 vs. 33.1 ± 16.2 years, P = 0.000); the mean duration of symptoms of TB with DM was more (124 ± 16.4 vs. 107.49 ± 10.3 days). Multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that increasing age, positive family history of diabetes, sedentary occupation, and presence of pulmonary TB were significantly associated with diabetes among TB patients.
3::Statistically significant improvement was observed in mean percentage change in erythema, scaling, and induration (ESI) (P = 0.048) in metformin as compared to placebo while mean percentage change in psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) and physician global assessment (PGA) scores was not significant (PASI - P = 0.215, PGA - P = 0.070). There was a statistically significant difference in percentage of parameters of MS improved following 12 weeks of treatment in metformin (19%) as compared to placebo (8.9%) group (P = 0.046). Statistically significant difference in percentage of patients achieving 75% reduction in ESI scores (P = 0.024). Significant improvement was observed in mean weight, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in metformin group as compared to placebo. Improvement in BMI, fasting plasma glucose, serum triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, LDL, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol was statistically significant in metformin group over the period of 12 weeks. There was no significant difference in adverse events in two groups except weight gain.
3::Patients receiving mechanical ventilation had higher prevalence and intensity of karyomegaly, perinuclear halos, cell keratinization, deep cells, and leukocyte infiltrates than did patients in the other 2 groups (P < .05). No significant differences were observed between the control group and the group who did not receive mechanical ventilation.
3::The overall rate of positive perception towards orthodontic treatment was 48.5%. Compared to adults in their 20s (63.2%), those in their 40s and 50s had a lower percentage of interest in orthodontic treatment (46.2% and 45.1%, respectively; p < 0.05). Overall, women (52.2%) had a higher rate of interest than did men (42.6%; p < 0.05). The area of living had no effect on the percentage of interest. The order of priority of chief complaints differed according to age: protrusion for those in the 20s and 30s, and spacing for those in the 40s to 60s. Overall, the main reason for not seeking treatment was the treatment fee. Respondents aged over 40 considered themselves ""too old"" for orthodontic treatment.
3::Of 128 females with hyperprolactinemia, 58 had prolactinoma (41 microadenoma and 17 macroadenoma) and 39 had DIH. Patients with prolactinoma had higher prolactin levels and increased frequency of oligomenorrhea (77.5% vs. 46%) as compared to DIH. Patients with macroprolactinoma had more severe menstrual disturbances compared to microprolactinoma. A higher percentage of patients with microprolactinoma and DIH achieved regular menstrual cycles compared to macroprolactinoma postcabergoline treatment (85% and 90% vs. 65%). There was no correlation between time to regularization of menstrual cycles with age, menstrual cycle length, duration of menstrual irregularity, or initial prolactin level in patients with prolactinoma. Linear regression analysis showed a significant association between time to regularization of menstrual cycles with time to normalization of prolactin levels (P = 0.001).
3::Of 363 patients, 83 (22.9%) were PNI-positive. The 5-year overall survival and disease-specific survival rates were significantly worse for patients with PNI-positive Dukes B or C disease compared to those with PNI-negative disease. There was no significant difference in the recurrence pattern (hematogenous or lymphatic spread), but patients with PNI-positive disease had a significantly higher rate of recurrence compared to those with PNI-negative disease (p<0.001).'
3::The median age of the five patients (two men, three women) was 61.4 (range=56-75) years. The surgical procedure was partial hepatectomy in two, laparoscopic partial hepatectomy in two, and one case of partial hepatectomy with subsegmentectomy. There was no postoperative complication of Clavien-Dindo grade 3A or higher. One patient had multiple lung metastases.
3::The phagocytic activity of latex beads was dependent on the concentration of beads and incubation time. LPSp, at as low as 100 pg/ml, significantly increased phagocytosis against the beads. In the experiment of Aβ1-42 phagocytosis, LPSp significantly increased Aβ phagocytic activity.
3::Expression of GalNAc-T6 was found to be significantly related to expression of E-cadherin. Positive expression of GalNAc-T6 was significantly associated with better histological grade and good clinical prognosis of patients, but positive E-cadherin and β-catenin expression were not significantly associated with improved overall survival.
3::Only one out of 294 single blastomeres (0.34%) would have resulted in a false-negative diagnosis. False-positive diagnoses were not detected.
3::Higher maximum serum concentration (Cmax) values resulted from i.v. administration, whereas longer time to maximum serum (Tmax) values resulted from i.p. administration. In the peritoneal dissemination model, i.p. administration inhibited tumour growth and increased survival rate, whereas in the subcutaneous model, i.v. administration significantly inhibited tumour growth compared to i.p. administration.
3::TX-1123 exhibited COX1-inhibitory activity [half-maximal-inhibitory concentration (IC50)=1.57×10(-5) M]. The COX2 inhibitory activity of TX-1123 was potent (IC50=1.16×10(-6) M), and the ratio of COX1/COX2 inhibition was 13.5. TX-1123 bound to the COX2 molecule, and the oxygen atom of the 4-cyclopentene-1,3-dione region of TX-1123 interacted with Cys(26) and Gln(447) of COX2.
3::There were no statistically significant differences between zirconia micro-implants and titanium alloy implants with regard to MIT, MRT, or the amount of movement in the angulated lateral displacement test. As angulation increased, the mean compressive and tensile forces required to displace both types of micro-implants increased substantially at all distances. The average bone-to-implant contact ratio of prototype zirconia micro-implants was 56.88 ± 6.72%.
3::Apremilast did not inhibit the proliferation of HKe3-wtPDE4B2 cells or HKe3-mtKRAS in two-dimensional cultures, whereas the number of apoptotic HKe3-wtPDE4B2 cells and HKe3-mtKRAS cells increased after apremilast treatment in 3DC, leading to formation of a luminal cavity. Tumour growth in nude mice was dramatically reduced by intraperitoneal injection of apremilast. Notably, a decreased level of caspase-1 expression was observed in HKe3-wtPDE4B2 and HKe3-mtKRAS cells.
3::The pooled correlation coefficient for all included studies was ρ=-0.59 (95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.72 to -0.45), heterogeneity Tau(2)=0.04 (p<0.0001), I(2)=73%, test for overall effect Z=8.67 (p<0.00001).
3::In 200 patients, mean age was 64.5 ± 7.0 years and age differed significantly in males and females (P < 0.0001). Osteoporosis was present in 35.5% adults with T2DM. Significantly greater proportion of females had osteoporosis (49.5% vs. 22.3%, P < 0.0001). Frequency of osteoporosis at spine (33.5%) was higher than the same at hip (13.5%). Compared to males, significantly greater proportion of females had osteoporosis and osteopenia at both spine (P < 0.0001) and hip (P < 0.0001). Among all parameters assessed, a significant positive correlation of T-score at spine and hip was seen with body mass index in both males (r = 0.287, P = 0.003 at spine and r = 0.421, P < 0.0001 at hip) and females (r = 0.291, P = 0.004 at spine and r = 0.280, P = 0.010 at hip). There was no association of Vitamin D deficiency (45.5% patients) with either T-score and presence of osteoporosis either at spine (P = 0.388 and P = 0.177) or hip (P = 0.431 and P = 0.593).
3::Low expression of KLF9 was observed in 62.82% of tumors, which was related to poor differentiation (p=0.036) and vascular invasion (p=0.017). Furthermore, the overall survival of patients with low KLF9 expression was significantly shorter than that of those with high KLF9 expression (p=0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed KLF9 as an independent prognostic factor (p=0.000).
3::With thorough examination and immunohistochemical stainings twenty-nine of 168 SLN biopsies (28 patients, 17% of the patients) showed micrometastases or ITC, and a full ALND was performed at a later time. During these ALNDs 13 to 31 lymph nodes were removed. Additional ALN metastases were found in three (10%) patients. Two (7%) of the 28 patients with triple-negative cancer deceased of metastatic breast cancer. Three patients (11%) reported adverse effects of ALND requiring physiotherapy due to pain, stiffness, swelling or arm oedema. Tumor factors such as molecular subtype (p=0.002), tumor size (p=0.004), and proliferation index (Ki-67) (p=0.003) correlated with higher numbers of ALN metastases.
3::A total of 102 patients were divided in three groups: Surgery with perioperative therapy, n=45; surgery alone, n=19; and dCRT, n=38. Overall, median progression-free survival and median survival time were 9.3 and 26.7 months, respectively. The median survival time was 27.5 months in the group treated with surgery with perioperative treatment, 50.6 months in those treated with surgery alone, and 22 months in the dCRT group. No significant survival difference was seen among the three groups.
3::Of 60 patients with headache, 17% had complete response, 82% partial response and 2% stable disease (best response). Of 39 patients with seizures, 31% had complete response, 64% partial response and 5% stable disease. Four patients developed recurrent seizures after 1 year. Regarding the size of cavernoma at 15 months, complete response was observed in 6%, partial response in 75%, stable disease in 15%, progression in 1% and pseudo-progression in 3% of patients. Bleeding within 2 years after RGS radiosurgery occurred in only five patients (6%). RGS dose had no significant impact on outcomes.
3::The layout identified using the proposed method improved the distances traveled by noncritical and critical patients by 42.2% and 47.6%, respectively, and minimized the relocation costs.
3::MDSCs and relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines increased in the peripheral blood of tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, the frequency of MDSCs rapidly increased in mice with tumor recurrence.
3::Students with higher stress scores had a higher incidence of substance use. Most students who had higher perceptions of faculty support tended to use fewer nonprescribed stimulants for academic enhancement.
3::VCM1 scores improved with AU resolution. VCM1 did not correlate with vision at baseline, but did on resolution of inflammation. Physical SF-36 scores were reduced during AU episodes and improved on resolution remaining below those of population norms. Subanalysis revealed that SpA scores were more affected than the idiopathic AU group.
3::The majority (96%) of the study participants perceived the peer support and yoga intervention to be beneficial. Paired t-test revealed significant increases in the social and environmental domain in the peer group and in the environmental domain in the yoga group, though this disappeared in the between-group comparison perhaps due to poor glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c varied from 9.4 to 9.6) and the short duration of 3 months of the study.
3::There were no major complications in any of our patients except in one patient who developed meatal stenosis which was treated by periodic dilatation. Three fold urethral mobilization was sufficient in all cases.
3::In PD-NC versus HC, results indicated decreased PCC-FC in the right temporal gyrus(TG) and increased PCC-FC in the left medial temporal lobe(MTL), bilateral precuneus(Pcu), and parieto-occipital junction(POJ), as well as GM atrophy in the bilateral prefrontal-striatal circuit(pFTSC), TG and Pcu. In PD-MCI versus PD-NC, decreased PCC-FC was found in the bilateral prefrontal cortex(PFC), left POJ, and right TG. In addition, PCC-FC of the bilateral Pcu and GM volume of the left MTL, bilateral TG, and PFC were positively associated with cognitive score.
3::The BMI-adjusted ultra-low-dose protocol reached high diagnostic accuracy values of 94% for Reader 1 and 93% for Reader 2. Moreover, in comparison to the ISP, it showed significantly (p<0.001) lower CTDIvol (1.97±0.55mGy vs. 4.18±0.62 mGy) and DLP (256±81mGy x cm vs. 544±83mGy x cm) but similar image quality (p=0.37 for CNR). Furthermore, image quality was similar between BMI groups (p=0.86 for CNR).
3::129,708 prescriptions were retrieved from the database. The overall expenditure on opioids was R$4,316,383.46 BRL or $2,721,315.82 (PPP). The mean cost of an individual prescription was R$33.27 BRL ($20.98 PPP), ranging from 14.19 to 3,255.60 BRL. Codeine was frequently prescribed (87.2 percent).
3::Co-administration of VitE and T significantly (P<0.05) increased ATZ-decreased TAC and TTM levels and reduced ATZ-increased MDA content. T and VitE significantly (P<0.05) increased serum levels of ATZ-reduced T (1.94 ± 0.96), IN-B (122.10 ± 24.33) and LH (0.40 ± 0.10). The T+VitE animals showed a reduction in apoptotic cells and an increase in Leydig cells steroidogenesis. Co-administration of T and VitE significantly (P<0.05) reduced the ATZ-induced DNA disintegrity and chromatin de-condensation. VitE and T protected germinal cells RNA and protein contents against ATZ-induced damages.
3::A total of 26 studies were eligible for inclusion. Results showed that sporotrichosis was the most common subcutaneous mycosis (99.7%), whereas lobomycosis, chromoblastomycosis, and subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis were rare. Cases of eumycetoma and subcutaneous zygomycosis were not found. Of the 25 regions, the burden of sporotrichosis was estimated for four regions classified as endemic; in nine regions, only isolated cases were reported. The highest burden of sporotrichosis was in Apurimac (15 cases/100,000 inhabitants; 57 cases/year), followed by Cajamarca (3/100,000 inhabitants; 30/year), Cusco (0.5/100,000 inhabitants; 4/year), and La Libertad (0.2/100,000 inhabitants; 2/year). In two regions, the mycoses predominantly affected children.
3::The mean arc of motion of group A (n = 20) increased from preoperatively 74.3° to 120.5° postoperatively (p < 0.001); group B (n = 22) showed an improvement of 104.6° preoperatively to 123.4° after surgery (p = 0.002). Mean improvement was 46.3° ± 27.5° in group A and 16.4° ± 19.4° in group B. Mean post-operative VAS was 0.9 ± 1.5 in group A and 1.3 ± 2.2 in group B. 92.9% of patients achieved a functional arc of elbow motion >100°. The ESAS indicated good to excellent clinical outcome showing 88.8 ± 10.0 points in group A and 84.1 ± 21.4 points in group B. Thirty-six patients (85.7%) returned to their previous work level after surgery.
3::Global measures showed a high correlation (breast volume R=0.99, volume of glandular tissue R=0.94, and volumetric breast density R=0.96) regardless the anode/filter material. Similarly, histogram intersection and correlation metric showed that, for each pair, the images share a high degree of information. Regarding the local distribution of glandular tissue, small changes in the angle of view do not yield significant differences in the glandular pattern, whilst changes in the breast thickness between both acquisition affect the spatial parenchymal distribution.
3::The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for the SUVmax did not reveal significant differences in OS (p=0.48). The MTV survival analysis showed a significant higher OS in patients presenting with a higher tumour burden than those with less tumour burden (p=0.01; 26 vs. 14 months), whereas TLG exhibited a similar trend though not significant (p=0.06). Apart from chemo-resistance, the higher the MTV, the better will be the response to chemotherapy.
3::Statistical analysis of data showed a significant root resorption between the experimental group and control group (P<0.05), however, there was no significant difference in the expression level of the inflammatory cytokine, TGF-β1.
3::Histopathologic examination of the injection sites showed evidence of hair growth in samples that received cells compared with the control group. However, the group that received epithelial and dermal papilla cells had visible evidence of hair growth. PKH tracing confirmed the presence of transplanted cells in the new hair.
3::The difference between the automatic annulus diameter and the reference standard by observer 1 was 0.2±1.0mm, with an inter-observer variability of 1.2±0.6mm. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the diameter was good (0.92 for observer 1). For the first time, a fully automatic tool to assess the optimal projection curves was presented and validated. The mean difference between the optimal projection curves calculated based on the automatically defined annulus plane and the reference standard was 6.4° in the cranial/caudal (CRA/CAU) direction. The mean computation time was short with around 60s per dataset.
3::A difference in FEV1 and PNIF reduction was detected between misoprostol and placebo (P = .03) and misoprostol and historical controls (P = .01), respectively, during nasal ketorolac challenge. No difference was detected among aspirin reactors. Among all reactors, no difference in magnitude was found for FEV1 (P = .13) or PNIF (P = .07) reduction across all 3 groups. Total treatment requirement was similar (P = .14). Patients receiving misoprostol were more likely to report adverse gastrointestinal effects (P = .02).
3::Almost all respondents (n = 47; 94%) were using C1-INH(IV) for HAE prophylaxis. Most patients reported administration of C1-INH(IV) through a peripheral vein (n = 34) and 19 were currently (n = 17) or previously (n = 2) using a central venous port. Most respondents (62%) who used a peripheral vein to administer treatment reported having difficulty finding a usable vein or getting the infusion to work properly at least some of the time. Issues accessing veins, exhausted veins, and frequency of attacks were the main reasons physicians recommended ports to respondents. Although ports allow easier administration of therapy, 47% of respondents with ports experienced problems such as occlusion, thrombosis, and infection. Respondents using C1-INH prophylaxis reported a mean of 2.3 attacks per month during the previous 6 months.
3::A significant correlation between blood eosinophils assessed by the 2 devices was found (R(2) = 0.854, P < .001); similar correlations were found also for white blood cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. The point-of-care device had the ability to predict blood eosinophil cutoffs used to select patients for biologic treatments for severe eosinophilic asthma and the ELEN index, a composite score useful to predict sputum eosinophilia.
3::Two hundred thirty-six patients were included, with a mean follow-up duration of 470 days. The mean age was 85.9 years. Seventy-five patients died during the follow-up period. One hundred nineteen patients (50.4%) had an EFS score of 0-3, 68 patients (28.8%) had an EFS score of 4-6, and 49 patients (20.8%) had an EFS score ≥ 7. The all-cause mortality rate was 17.7% in the EFS 0-3 group, 35.3% in the EFS 4-6 group, and 61.2% in the EFS ≥ 7 group (P < 0.001). After multivariate analysis, frailty status remained associated with all-cause mortality: the hazard ratio (HR) was 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-3.16) in the EFS 4-6 group, and the HR was 3.60 (95% CI, 1.70-7.63) in the EFS ≥ 7 group.
3::Among 2746 women with BC (72.6% were admitted to specialized hospitals), the overall average expenditure was US $8450 (medical expenditure: $7527; non-medical expenditure: $922). Significant differences were found among the overall expenditure in the four clinical stages (P < 0.0001); the expenditure was higher in stages III and IV than that in stages I and II, whereas the stage IV was the highest (P < 0.0001). Moreover, a higher self-reported predicted reimbursement ratio was associated with a less economic impact on the patients family, and the average time lost was estimated as $1529.'
3::In a univariate analysis, the factors significantly associated with SR were lower body mass index (BMI); younger age; a higher number of allergens in the extracts; and the presence of cat, dust mite, and certain weed pollens. In a multivariate analysis, cat, dust mite, and mugwort were significantly associated with SRs. Over the 10-year period, 50 patients experienced SRs (13.81%), with a total number of 68 SRs. Only 4.7% of the SRs occurred on the MERIT day. Most SRs occurred >30 minutes and were mild. Our MERIT protocol continuation rate for all the patients was 49.2% and did not seem to be influenced by having an SR versus no SR.
3::Based on the AEDS symptom records from 87,879 person-days, the mean symptom score difference from baseline in patients with AEDS increased significantly in spring, autumn, and winter relative to the reference season (summer): by 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.81) in spring, by 0.45 (95% CI, 0.24-0.67) in winter, and by 0.18 (95% CI, 0.02-0.36) in autumn. The mean symptom score difference from baseline increased significantly in January, February, March, April, May, June, October, November, and December relative to the reference month of August.
3::Little change was observed in over- or underweight perceptions. However, relative to those perceiving their body as about right', those perceiving themselves as overweight reported decreasing confidence (all groups), decreasing happiness (11- and 13-year-old girls), and increasing psychological health symptoms (all girls and 15-year-old boys). Perceived underweight is associated with poor well-being, especially in males, but we present little evidence that this is a recent phenomenon.'
3::A total of 561 patients with influenza (15.9% with asthma) and 1258 patients without influenza (8.0% with asthma) were included as cases and controls, respectively. The adjusted risk of influenza for patients with asthma was calculated by multivariate conditional logistic regression. The adjustment variables were the following: smoker/nonsmoker, pneumonia in the 2 years before hospital admission, previous oral treatment with corticosteroids, influenza vaccination during the seasonal campaign, Barthel index (ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living), level of education, obesity, and the presence of other comorbidities. Patients with asthma presented a great risk of influenza (adjusted odds ratio 2.64 [95% confidence interval, 1.77-3.94]). Compared with patients without asthma, patients with asthma had more symptoms, and these had been present for longer before admission but presented a lower hospital or postdischarge mortality.
3::The average absolute distance between the CT and the various MR-based bone models were all below 1mm across all bones. The VIBE sequence provided the best agreement with the CT model, followed by the SPACE, then the TrueFISP data. The most notable difference was for the proximal tibia (VIBE 0.45mm, SPACE 0.82mm, TrueFISP 0.83mm).
3::At the pre-implantation stage the majority of participants in all three groups considered the human embryo as ""not a human being"". Also, at the post-implantation stage of development, the majority of infertile couples and clinic staff considered the embryo as ""not a human being"" but, half the researchers (51%) considered the embryo in this stage as a ""potential human"". Half of the infertile couples considered the human fetus before ensoulment time (19(th) week of pregnancy according to the Shiite Islamic scholars) as ""not-human being"", while more than half of researchers (55.1%) considered it as a ""potential human"".
3::On the 30th days of the experiment, serum level of magnesium and potassium decreased significantly in EG group compared with A,C,D,E and F groups (P &lt; .05), while serum level of calcium, creatinine, uric acid, sodium and urine level of calcium, creatinine, uric acid, increased significantly in EG group compared with A,C,D,E and F groups (P &lt; .05). In the prevention and treatment groups, the number of deposits decreased significantly compared with EG group on the 30th day (P &lt; .05).
3::We found bronchoceles >5mm in 13/43 patients. 5/13 patients had a positive diagnosis of ABPA. The median HU value of bronchoceles was higher in patients with than without ABPA [98 HU (26-135) vs 28 HU (10-36); P=0,02]. Moreover, all patients with a bronchocele density >36HU were ABPA positive.
3::Working life: both women (55.6%) and men (51.04%) were similarly affected, but women had worse disease activity (5.4 vs 4.0, p = 0.01) and less antitumor necrosis factor-α therapy (56.7% vs 77.6%, p < 0.05). Different patterns were found by gender: women mostly practiced presenteeism whereas men practiced absenteeism, women took antiinflammatories prior to work and men after work, employers suggested more frequently the beneficial actions for men, and some women withdrew permanently from the labor market. Family/partner relationships: women were more affected (57.4%) than men (41.7%), with worse results for diagnostic delay (11.2 vs 6.4 yrs, p = 0.02), disease activity (5.8 vs 3.6, p < 0.001), and physical function (5.2 vs 3.8, p = 0.02). Gender role conflicts emerged, with women developing strategies to face compulsory housework whereas men avoided them; women regretted neglecting their children and men not sharing leisure activities with them.
3::Over 112.5 ± 88.4 months, 135 episodes of renal flare occurred, giving a flare rate of 0.108 episodes per patient-year. The renal relapse-free survival rate was 96%, 90%, 86%, 80%, 69%, and 57% after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 years, respectively, calculated from the start of induction treatment. Reduced risk of flare was associated with MPA maintenance (OR 0.314, 95% CI 0.099-0.994, p = 0.049), complete remission after induction immunosuppression (OR 0.329, 95% CI 0.133-0.810, p = 0.016), and diagnosis after 1998 (OR 0.305, 95% CI 0.133-0.700, p = 0.005). Relapse-free survival was significantly better in patients treated with prednisolone and MPA as maintenance immunosuppression (91% after 5 yrs and 83% after 10 yrs, respectively) compared with prednisolone and AZA (70% and 52%, respectively, p = 0.044). LN diagnosed in 1998-2013 showed 5-year and 10-year relapse-free survival rates of 93% and 86%, respectively, compared with 81% and 66%, respectively (p = 0.017) for LN that presented in 1983-1997.
3:: Overall, 1233 polyps were removed using cold snare resection with an overall success rate of 99.4 %. All failures of cold snare resection occurred in the cecum (8/82, failure rate 9.8 %). In the remaining colon, the success rate was 100 %. Immediate post-polypectomy bleeding occurred in 0.49 % of all patients and was most frequently seen in polyps larger than 9 mm. The procedure time was significantly shorter using cold snare resection compared with hot snare resection (27.6 min vs. 35.7 min, P  < 0.01).
3::Histopathology confirmed the presence of gastric cancer in 28 patients (70%), while gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) were recognized in the remaining 12 cases (30%). Correct diagnoses of the type of gastric tumor in hydro-CT were obtained in 37 patients (92.5%). This was not significantly different from the 85% accuracy of endoscopy. Further analysis showed that the correctness of GIST diagnosis in endoscopy and hydro-CT also did not differ significantly (91.7% and 100% respectively). The percentage of correctly diagnosed malignant lesions in hydro-CT was lower than for GISTs at 89.29%, while in endoscopy it was insignificantly lower (82.14%). The diagnostic accuracy of conventional and low-dose hydro-CT in the diagnosis of gastric tumors (95% and 90% respectively) was not significantly different.
3::Pearson correlation coefficients between mREE and the anthropometric variables showed positive significance with suprailiac skinfold thickness, lean body mass (LBM), waist circumference, hip circumference, bone mineral mass, and body mass. All eight predictive equations underestimated the REE of the weightlifters when compared with the mREE. The highest mean difference was 636 kcal/day (Owen, 1986) and the lowest difference was 375 kcal/day (Cunninghams, 1980). Multiple linear regression done stepwise showed that LBM was the only significant determinant of REE in this group of sportspersons. A new equation using LBM as the independent variable for calculating REE was computed. REE for weightlifters = -164.065 + 0.039 (LBM) (confidence interval -1122.984, 794.854]. This new equation reduced the mean difference with mREE by 2.36 + 369.15 kcal/day (standard error = 67.40).
3::Estimated blood loss and blood transfusion volume was higher in OMC (ps < 0.001). The operative time was longer in RALC groups (p < 0.001). On POD0, interleukin (IL)-6 showed significant lower level in RALC-IUD compared to OMC (p = 0.016). IL-10 level was higher at POD0 (p = 0.029) and POD1 (p = 0.038) in OMC vs. RALC-EUD. MCP-1 levels for RALC-IUD were significantly lower compared to RALC-EUD (p = 0.027).'
3::For the short scan time protocols, a diagnostic peak enhancement was achieved using 20mL of CA at 70 and 80kVp (PAE: 327±10 and 255±15 HU, respectively) or 30mL of CA at 70, 80 and 100kVp (PAE 451±10, 367±9, and 253±15 HU). For the long scan time, the optimized multi-bolus injection protocol extended T200 at 100kVp by 6s (40%) compared to a linear injection protocol (21±1s and 15±1s, respectively; p<0.001).
3::CRMDCT showed significant lower attenuation values compared to CRDLCT and MonoE at 40-70keV (p≤0.05). Moreover, MonoE at 40-70keV revealed significantly higher attenuations values compared to CRDLCT (p<0.001). Noise was statistically lower in CRMDCT compared with CRDLCT and MonoE at 40keV (11.4±2.3 HU vs. 12.0±3.1 HU vs. 11.7±5.2 HU; p<0.001). In contrast, all MonoE levels showed significantly lower noise levels compared to CRDLCT (p<0.001). SNR was not significantly different between CRMDCT and CRDLCT (13.5±3.7 vs. 14.4±5.3; p>0.99). SNR values were significantly increased for MonoE at 40-80keV compared to CRMDCT and CRDLCT (p<0.001). CRDLCT and MonoE (40-70keV) from DLCT revealed significantly higher CNR values than CRMDCT (p<0.001). In subjective analysis, MonoE at 40keV surpassed all other image reconstructions except for noise in MonoE at 70 keV.
3:: En-bloc resection and curative resection rates did not differ. Compared with the single group, each procedure time was faster (31.8 ± 23.6 min vs. 45.8 ± 44.8, P  = 0.002), but total procedure time was significantly longer in the simultaneous group (70.6 ± 33.4 vs. 45.8 ± 44.8 min, P  = 0.01). Rates of adverse events including bleeding and perforation were not higher in the simultaneous group but the mean blood pressure, incidence of bradycardia and the amount of sedative drug used during ESD were significantly higher in the simultaneous group. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified non-experienced physician, lesion size ≥ 40 mm and submucosal fibrosis as an independent risk factor for procedure duration (≥ 90 min) (Odds ratio 11.852, 18.280, and 3.672; P  < 0.05, respectively).
3::A total of 14 articles including 549 patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding were enrolled in the meta-analysis. The combined PLR, NLR and DOR were respectively 8.149, 0.158 and 56.213. There were significant heterogeneities in all estimations but we could not find the sources by meta-regression based on study design, study location, CT slices and sample size. The AUC and Q index under the fixed effect model was respectively 0.9463 and 0.8856.
3::Using the main definition of adherence, there were no significant differences between late anti-TNF users and timely anti-TNF users in total costs (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.54-1.36, p = 0.516) or nonbiologic costs (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.44-1.18, p = 0.187). However, in the sensitivity analysis, late anti-TNF users had significantly increased nonbiologic costs compared with timely users (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.06-2.36, p = 0.026). In the main analysis, there were no significant differences in QALY between timely anti-TNF users and late anti-TNF users, or between timely users and patients with unmet anti-TNF need. In the sensitivity analysis, patients with unmet anti-TNF need had significantly lower QALY than timely anti-TNF users (-0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to -0.01, p = 0.016).
3::Choledocolithasis was diagnosed by MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic retrograde (ERCP) in 496 of 1,000 patients reviewed. Mean CBD was 6.0 mm (±2.8 mm) in the 504 of 1,000 patients without choledocolithiasis on ERCP/MRCP. Increasing age had no correlation with CBD size as a continuous variable (r2 = 0.011, p = 0.811). No difference occurred across age groups (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.157). Age had no association with diagnostic likelihood of choledocolithiasis (AOR [95% CI] 0.99 [0.98-1.01], adjusted-p = 0.335).
3::Mean age of study population was 54.81 ± 9.10 years. Sixty-five percent (65.5%) of atorvastatin users had coronary heart disease, 62.5% were hypertensive, 38% had diabetes. Thirty-five percent (35.5%) patients were taking 10 mg/day atorvastatin, 45% were taking 20 mg/day, and 19.5% were taking 40 mg/day. The overall frequency of myopathy among statin users was 7.5% which was significantly higher with increasing dose of atorvastatin (1.4% in 10 mg/day group, 10% in 20 mg/day group, and 12.8% in 40 mg/day, P < 0.05). The frequency of atorvastatin-related myopathy was higher in females 8.65% compared to 6.25% in males. Serum TSH levels in patients with myopathy were 4.05 ± 7.76 μIU/ml while in those without myopathy were 3.13 ± 2.88 μIU/ml (P = 0.649). Serum 25-hydroxy Vitamin D levels were measured in 66 patients randomly. Mean levels in patients with myopathy were 15.98 ± 12.94 ng/ml and without myopathy were 10.20 ± 5.64 ng/ml (P = 0.285).
3::Of the 132 patients included retrospectively, 27 (20.5%) patients developed HMs. The mean time to diagnosis of HM was 103.9±55.2days. HMs were multiple in 81.4% of cases and bilobar in 59.3% of cases; their mean maximum size was 16.7±12.7mm. In univariate logistic analysis, lymphovascular emboli were significantly associated with HM (p=0.02). No independent risk factors for HM were found in multivariate analysis. In multivariate logistic analysis, two independent risk factors were identified for the occurrence of early recurrence: tumor size >23mm on preoperative CT scan (OR: 3.3; 95% CI: [1.2-9.3]; p=0.02) and tumor differentiation (poor vs. good: OR 15.5; 95 CI [1.5-158.3]; moderate vs. good: OR: 17.1; 95% CI: [1.9-154.4]; p=0.04).
3::The 27-G and 25-G groups did not differ significantly in underlying diseases and preoperative Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) score. The time required for vitrectomy was significantly longer in the 27-G group (35.3 vs. 29.8 min, P = 0.0013). Postoperative hypotony was observed in 0 and 3 patients, and ocular hypertension in 10 and 14 patients in the 27-G and 25-G groups, respectively, showing more stabilized postoperative ocular pressure in the 27-G group. Gain in ETDRS score was significantly better in the 27-G group (12.1 ± 20.2 letters) compared to the 25-G group (10.0 ± 21.3 letters) (P = 0.0323) at 1 month post-vitrectomy, but not significantly different at 3 and 6 months (P = 0.0686 and 0.0543). Rates of postoperative retinal detachment (1 vs. 1%) and vitreous hemorrhage (2 vs. 3%) were not different between two groups.
3::A significant effect was only detected for sex (F = 5.418, p = 0.020); PSC thickness showed a higher mean value in women (mean difference ± SE: 0.224 ± 0.096 mm). A significant and negative r value was detected for males aged >45 years (-0.173, p = 0.026); in that group of patients, PSC thickness decreased as age increased (0.018 ± 0.008 mm/year). For females aged ≤45 years, a significant and positive r value was found (0.198, p = 0.022); in that group, PSC thickness increased as age increased (0.020 ± 0.008 mm/year).
3::BLES revealed fourteen (41.1%) high-risk lesions, ten (29.4%) ductal carcinomas in situ, and ten (29.4%) invasive cancers. Identical results between BLES and surgery were seen in 17/34 (50%) lesions. Surgery confirmed total excision of BLES in 15/34 (44.1%) lesions. Underestimation was seen in 2/34 (5.8%) lesions.
3::Compared with optic nerves in the control group, the mean FA was significant decreased (P<0.005), and the mean MD, λ//and λ⊥ significant increased (P<0.005). The average and temporal peripapillary RNFL thickness were significantly thinned in LHON patients. There was a significant correlation between optic nerve FA and VA, mean deviation of visual field (MDVF) (P<0.005). Also, optic nerve FA correlated significantly with average RNFL thickness (P<0.05) but not with MD, λ//and λ⊥ (P>0.05). However, none of the DTI parameters correlated with age and disease duration (P>0.05).
3::Questionnaires were returned by 142 orthodontists (43.8%) and completed by 100 laypersons. The larger the size of the caries lesion in the maxillary second premolar was found, the more orthodontists and laypersons both chose to extract a carious maxillary second premolar instead of a healthy maxillary first premolar. For orthodontists, the use of mini-implant anchorage was significantly related to their extraction decision. Orthodontists who were familiar with mini-implants usage would choose to extract the second premolar at a lower size of extent of caries. Besides, when larger sizes of caries lesions in maxillary second premolars were considered, laypersons tended to have greater acceptance of the use of additional anchorage devices in order to keep the healthy maxillary first premolar.
3::One hundred and seventeen cases of AKI-MALA-RRT were observed (12.04/100,000 metformin treated diabetics, 1.45% of all RRT-ICU patients). Survival rate was 78.3%. The average duration of RRT was 4.0 days at mean dialysis effluent of 977 mL/kg/day. At admission most patients were dehydrated, and experienced shock and oliguria.
3::The detectability and calcium scores decreased at increasing IR levels (τb<-0.825, p<0.001) and increasing tube voltage (τb<-0.679, p<0.001). For 90kVp-IR3 and 100kVp-IR1, similar detectability and calcium score was found compared to the reference protocol (p>0.206). For these protocols, lower tube currents did not affect the detectability and Agatston score (p>0.206), while CNR and SNR were similar/higher compared to the reference protocol (0.008<p<0.206). Dose reduction was 60.6% (90kVp-IR3) and 43.6% (100kVp-IR1).
3::During the study period, 63,258 soccer-related injuries were captured by NEISS, which translates to an estimated 2,039,250 injuries seen at US EDs nationwide. Commonly injured body parts included the head/face (19.1%), ankle (17.6%), hand/wrist (15.3%), and knee (12.2%). Common diagnoses included sprains/strains (34.0%), fractures (22.2%), and contusions (17.7%). Compared to their respective age ranges in NEISS, sprains/strains comprised a larger proportion of injuries in HS RIO (48.3% vs. 33.7%; IPR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.33, 1.42) and NCAA-ISP (51.3% vs. 37.0%; IPR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.31, 1.46). In contrast, fractures comprised a smaller proportion of injuries in HS RIO than in NEISS (7.5% vs. 18.6%; IPR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.47) and NCAA-ISP (2.8% vs. 15.7%; IPR = 0.18; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.22).
3::Perianal abscess was found in 16 of the 36 patients. In 10 of these 16 patients there was also extensive inflammatory signal alterations in perianal and/or perineal soft tissues. In six of the 36 patients perianal fistula was detected. A sinus tract was seen at the level of subcutaneous external anal sphincter in one patient. Inflammatory signal alterations in the surrounding soft tissues were present in three of these seven patients. There were abscesses in labium majus in two patients and in one patient there were perineal abscesses with accompanying inflammatory signal alterations. In six of the 36 patients no abscess or fistula/sinus tract was seen. There were only inflammatory signal alterations with contrast enhancement in perianal or subcutaneous tissues. In two patients presenting with perianal pain and hemorrhoids, minimal inflammatory changes were detected on MR images. There were two patients with normal MR imaging findings.
3::There were 17,777 patients identified; 5.0% (N = 889) had an additional diagnosis of OSA. The OSA cohort had more comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, coagulopathy, hypertension, hypothyroidism, liver disease, obesity, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, acromegaly, and Cushings syndrome. Postoperatively, OSA was independently associated with increased risks of tracheostomy (P = .015) and hypoxemia (P < .001), and decreased risk of cardiac complications (P = .034). OSA patients did not have increased rates of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, diabetes insipidus, reintubation, aspiration pneumonia, infectious pneumonia, thromboembolic complications, or urinary/renal complications. In-hospital mortality rates did not vary between the two cohorts.'
3::Our search strategy resulted in the identification of 126 articles. After the eligibility assessment, 45 papers met the inclusion criteria. Full clinical and neurophysiological data were further extracted and involved 92 patients with PPN (54.5% males, mean age 60.0 ± 12.2 years). The commonest first manifestation of PPN is sensory loss (67.4%), followed by pain (41.3%), weakness (22.8%), and sensory ataxia (20.7%). In 13.0% of the cases, pain was the sole first manifestation of the PPN. During the course of the PPN, 57.6% of the patients may experience pain secondary to the neuropathy.
3::The region corresponding to the maxillary canines appeared to be thinner, and the palatal area of the maxillary central incisors and the distobuccal region of the mandibular second molars appeared to be thicker. Greater tooth inclinations were observed in the maxillary incisors and mandibular canines, and smaller tooth inclinations were observed on the buccal roots of the mandibular second molars.
3::Receipt of a follow-up visit within 30 days of discharge was associated with a slightly lower adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of hospital readmission during days 31-120 postdischarge (schizophrenia, AOR=.88, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.81-.96; bipolar disorder, AOR=.91, CI=.85-.98). For patients with schizophrenia, the strongest observed inverse association of follow-up care with readmission risk was among inpatients whose index admissions were 13 to 30 days long (AOR=.73, CI=.61-.89). For patients with bipolar disorder, the strongest corresponding inverse association was among those in the manic phase of illness at the index discharge (AOR=.73, CI=.63-.86).
3::A significant decrease in speed (p = 0.001) and stride length (p<0.001) was observed between the control and stroller conditions, however no significant change in energetic cost (p = 0.080) or heart rate (p = 0.393) was observed. Additionally, pushing method had a significant effect on speed (p = 0.001) and stride length (p<0.001).
3::The study population consisted of 6,983 individuals, which included 927 switchers (168 virologically stable; 55 virologically+clinically stable), who were matched with replacement with 18,511 nonswitcher comparators. The switcher cohort was 88.8% male (mean age 43.8 years). Mean preindex and follow-up treatment durations for switchers and nonswitchers were 1.8 years and 1.5 years, respectively; demographic characteristics, pre-index treatment duration, and follow-up duration were similar between cohorts. Significantly more nonswitchers than switchers had a first-line efavirenz-based regimen (67.2% vs. 47.8%, P < 0.001). In the virologically stable subset, follow-up annualized health care utilization for switchers versus nonswitchers, respectively, was 14.8 versus 12.3 ambulatory visits (P < 0.05), 0.8 versus 0.9 emergency department visits (P = 0.652), and 0.05 versus 0.05 inpatient hospitalizations (P = 0.915). Follow-up annualized health care costs were $37,120 for switchers versus $31,771 for nonswitchers (P < 0.05), with the difference driven largely by pharmacy costs. Multivariable-adjusted follow-up annualized health care costs were 8.9% higher among switchers versus nonswitchers (P < 0.01), and switchers also had a shorter time to subsequent ART regimen change (P < 0.001). Results were similar for the virologically+clinically stable subset.
3::Comparative analysis revealed that the presence of active bleeding and the hemoperitoneum depth were significantly different between the surgery and conservative management groups and were confirmed as significant CT findings for predicting surgery, with adjusted odds ratio (ORs) of 3.773 and 1.318, respectively (p < 0.01). On the receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis for hemoperitoneum depth, the optimal cut-off value was 5.8 cm with 73.7% sensitivity and 58.6% specificity (Az = 0.711, p = 0.004). In cases with a hemoperitoneum depth > 5.8 cm and concurrent active bleeding, the OR for surgery increased to 5.786.
3::B1-inhomogeneity resulted in -23-5% fluctuations (95% confidence interval [CI] of % error) of FA. The 95% CIs of FA-dependent % errors in the gray matter and blood were as follows: -16.7-61.8% and -16.7-61.8% for the pre-contrast R1, -1.0-0.3% and -5.2-1.3% for the contrast-enhancement ratio, and -14.2-58.1% and -14.1-57.8% for the Gd-concentration, respectively. These resulted in -43.1-48.4% error for K(trans), -32.3-48.6% error for the ve, and -43.2-48.6% error for vp. The pre-contrast R1 was more vulnerable to FA error than the contrast-enhancement ratio, and was therefore a significant cause of the Gd-concentration error. For example, a -10% FA error led to a 23.6% deviation in the pre-contrast R1, -0.4% in the contrast-enhancement ratio, and 23.6% in the Gd-concentration. In a simulated condition with a 3% FA error in a target lesion and a -10% FA error in a feeding vessel, the % errors of the pharmacokinetic parameters were -23.7% for K(trans), -23.7% for ve, and -23.7% for vp.
3::Altogether 32 cases were diagnosed, which represents an incidence of 1.44‰ of live newborn infants. 59% were males and 37.5% of them were macrosomic. The most frequent disorder was injury to the plexus at the proximal level (94%). 44% suffered from shoulder dystocia, and 47% still had sequelae at the sixth month. The antecedent of shoulder dystocia was related with a poor prognosis for recovery.
3::SUVmax showed a negative correlation with ADC (r = -0.404, p = 0.009). The median of SUVmax was 3.22 in HCC, 6.99 in CCC, 6.30 in metastatic tumors, and 1.82 in benign lesions. The median of ADC was 1.039 × 10-3 mm/s2 in HCC, 1.148 × 10-3 mm/s2 in CCC, 0.876 × 10-3 mm/s2 in metastatic tumors, and 1.323 × 10-3 mm/s2 in benign lesions. SUVmax was higher in metastatic tumors than in benign lesions (p = 0.023). Metastatic tumors had a lower ADC than CCC (p = 0.039) and benign lesions (p = 0.004). HCC had a lower ADC than benign lesions, with a suggestive trend (p = 0.06).
3::In total, 18,890 dabigatran patients were matched to corresponding warfarin patients. Compared to warfarin users, dabigatran users PPPM had significantly fewer all-cause hospitalizations (0.04 vs 0.05), total outpatient visits (3.98 vs 5.87), and lower 30-day readmissions (14.5% vs 17.4%, all p < 0.001). Dabigatran users had lower incidence rate for stroke (0.65 vs 1.06) and bleed (1.69 vs 2.20), stroke (0.0006 vs 0.0011, p < 0.001) and bleed-specific hospitalizations (0.002 vs 0.003, p = 0.008), and stroke (0.03 vs 0.04, p < 0.001) and bleed-specific outpatient visits (0.07 vs 0.08, p = 0.018), and significantly lower non-persistence (62.1% vs 66.3%, p < 0.001).
3::Skin Gb3 deposits were found in all FD patients with classical GLA mutations but never in FD patients with late-onset variants or GLA polymorphisms or in patients with SFN and healthy controls. Abnormal deposits were found inside different skin structures but never inside axons. FD patients with GB3 deposits showed lower skin innervation than FD patients with late-onset variants or polymorphisms.
3::Unsteadiness was independently associated with an increased risk of all outcomes at follow-up after adjusting for sociodemographic variables, and physical, mental, and cognitive health (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] range 1.49-2.29; P < .05). All associations were attenuated after adjusting for usual gait speed but remained consistent in direction. The association was strongest for fear-related activity restriction [IRR = 1.82 (1.21-2.73); P < .01]. There was also evidence of an association between unsteadiness and an increased risk of activity restriction in adults who did not report FOF at baseline [IRR = 1.99 (1.10-3.61); P < .05].
3::More than 8,600 patients in several surgical and medical populations, including joint replacement, cervical spine surgery, and congestive heart failure, have been supported by Care Link. For example, preoperative assessment of patients with elective joint replacement to predict post-acute care needs led to an increase in the volume of patients discharged to home with self-care or with home health care by 30%-from 61% to 80%.
3::Treatment engagement, two measures of psychotherapy receipt, and psychosocial treatment were significantly associated with perceived improvement, whereas treatment initiation and follow-up after hospitalization (seven and 30 days) were not. Psychotherapy receipt and follow-up after hospitalization (seven and 30 days) were significantly associated with global rating of behavioral health care.
3::Nine studies, including 488 samples were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled OR of T-cadherin promoter methylation in cancer tissues was 16.73 (95%CI=6.24-44.87), 19.48 (95%CI=5.64-67.31) and 2.23 (95%CI=1.05-4.75) compared to normal tissues, adjacent tissues and premalignant tissues, respectively. The relationship between T-cadherin promoter methylation and clinicopathological features were also analyzed. However, a significant association was not observed between T-cadherin promoter methylation status and gender, tumor stage, and lymph node status (p>0.05).
3::In total, 113 proteins were found differentially expressed between the normal and the cervical cancer lines. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the actin cytoskeleton signaling pathway to be significantly affected, while up-regulation of cofilin-1, an actin depolymerizing factor, was documented and further validated by western blotting. Furthermore, two-way comparisons among the four cell lines, revealed a set of 18 informative differentially expressed proteins.
3::In transfected cells, a total of 748 biotinylated proteins were identified from cells expressing biotin ligase-tagged K-Ras variants. Significant differences were observed between membrane-associated variants and a farnesylation-defective mutant. In pancreatic cancer cells, 56 K-Ras interaction partners were identified. Most of these were cytoskeletal or plasma membrane proteins, and many have been identified previously as potential cancer biomarkers.
3::There appears to be a higher responsiveness of PC when doctors are paid via capitation than when they only receive a fee for services or a mixed payment method. In addition, countries that spend more on health services are associated with higher levels of dignity and autonomy.
3::Heat maps and picto-trendlines were evaluated more positively than dot maps. Heat maps were more effective than picto-trendlines and no different from dot maps at increasing interest in vaccination, perceived risk of contracting disease, and interest in additional information about the disease. Heat maps and picto-trendlines were more successful at conveying knowledge than dot maps. Overall, heat maps were the only graphic to be superior in every outcome.
3::From a total of 53 relevant studies including 1853 patients, only 1021 patients undergoing 35 different total aortic arch procedures were found eligible for further evaluation and included in group I, II, or III (429, 190, and 402 patients, respectively). Overall early mortality was higher in group I vs groups II and III (P = .001; 1 - β = 95.6%) but exceeded in group III (18.6%) and group II (14.0%) vs group I (8.0%; P = .044; 1 - β = 57.4%) for diseases involving zone 0. Mortality was higher in all subgroups treated for zone 0 disease compared with corresponding subgroups treated for zone I to zone III disease. The incidence of cerebral ischemic events was increased in groups I and II vs group III (7.5% and 11% vs 1.7%; P = .0001) and correlated with early mortality (R(2) = .20; P = .033). The incidence of type II endoleaks and endovascular reintervention was similar between groups and correlated with each other (R(2) = .37; P = .004). Type Ia endoleak occurred more often in groups II and III than in group I (7.1% and 12.1% vs 5.8%; P = .023) and correlated with midterm mortality (R(2) = .53; P = .005). Retrograde type A dissection was low in all groups, whereas aneurysm growth was higher in group III (2.6%, 4.2%, 10.7%; P = .002), correlating with midterm mortality (R(2) = .311; P = .009). Surgical revision slightly correlated with surgical complications (R(2) = .18; P = .044) but not with mortality (R(2) = .10; P = .214).
3::Conversely to lean subjects, TEE and AEE did not increase in overweight participants due to a spontaneous decrease in non-training AEE. Despite this compensatory behavior, aerobic fitness, insulin sensitivity and fat oxidation were improved by exercise training. The latter was not explained by changes in dietary fat trafficking but more likely by a coordinated response at the muscle level enhancing fat uptake, acylation and oxidation (FABPpm, CD36, FATP1, ACSL1, CPT1, mtGPAT). ACSL1 fold change positively correlated with total fasting (R(2)=0.59, P<0.0001) and postprandial (R(2)=0.49, P=0.0006) fat oxidation whereas mtGPAT fold change negatively correlated with dietary palmitate oxidation (R(2)=0.40, P=0.009), suggesting modified fat trafficking between oxidation and storage within the muscle. However, for most of the measured parameters the post-training values observed in overweight adults remained lower than the pre-training values observed in the lean subjects.
3::A total of 12 patients were included for analysis, five of which experienced HIT related thrombosis prior to initiation of DOAC therapy. Seven patients received parenteral therapy with argatroban prior to initiation of DOAC treatment. Nine patients were treated with apixaban while three received rivaroxaban for an average of 9.33 days while hospitalized. Zero patients experienced the primary outcome of HIT related thrombosis and no patients experienced major bleeding post DOAC initiation. All patients achieved platelet recovery while receiving DOAC therapy.
3::Data showed an insignificant decrease of tumor growth after iv and ip treatment with low doses of BTB14431 and emodin. Differential blood analysis showed apoptosis. Increased doses of emodin clearly raised mortality rate.
3::In 2011, 10% of all fee-for-service dual eligible patients aged less than 65 years in Massachusetts were seen at Boston Medical Center. Data before propensity score matching showed significant differences in age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, employment, physical comorbidities, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score between patients with and without behavioral health illness. Analysis after propensity score matching found significant differences in sex, Hispanic race, and other education and employment status. Compared with patients without behavioral health illness, patients with behavioral health illness had a higher RR for hospital admissions (RR = 2.07; 95% CI = 1.81-2.38; P < 0.001) and ED use (RR = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.46-1.77; P < 0.001). Results were robust after adjusting for characteristics that remained statistically significantly different after propensity score matching.
3::Task-related activation in right caudate nucleus was predicted by an interaction of clinical responses to methylphenidate and atomoxetine (F1,30 = 17.00; p < .001). Elevated caudate activation was associated with robust improvement for methylphenidate and little improvement for atomoxetine. The rate of robust response was higher for methylphenidate than for atomoxetine in youth with high (94.4% vs. 38.8%; p = .003; number needed to treat = 2, 95% CI = 1.31-3.73) but not low (33.3% vs. 50.0%; p = .375) caudate activation. Furthermore, response to atomoxetine predicted motor cortex activation (F1,30 = 14.99; p < .001).
3::The intervention and control neighborhoods included 177 and 116 children respectively. The average attendance per event was 60 children (SD = 22, reach 34%). In the intervention neighborhood, a significant increase between baseline and final assessment was observed in after-school outdoor playtime (p = 0.02), steps during the 3-hour intervention (p = 0.004), and daily steps Monday to Sunday (p = 0.006). Meanwhile, no changes were observed in the control neighborhood for the same variables. The proportion of children who met recommended daily step counts increased from 27.5% to 53.0% in the intervention neighborhood (p = 0.007), while for control neighborhood no difference was observed (49.0% to 53.0% p = 0.804).
3::Cases in all age groups in both databases had more diagnoses annually than controls (mean =9-17 per year vs. 4-10 per year, P < 0.001), and the number of diagnoses decreased with age for cases and controls. Among the most common case diagnoses were upper respiratory infections (28.9%-59.1% vs. 19.5%-52.9%); suppurative otitis media (25.1%-56.8% vs. 8.7%-51.2%); nutrition/metabolic/developmental symptoms (37.9%-50.4% vs. 7.7%-10.6%); delays in development (22.8%-52.8% vs. 4.1%-10.9%); and general symptoms (35.1%-47.2% vs. 22.1%-37.2%), and the prevalence of each was greater among cases versus controls in all age groups in both databases (P < 0.001). The most common diagnoses among controls included some of the same as among cases, as well as acute pharyngitis (18.7%-31.8% vs. 19.2%-30.5%); allergic rhinitis (19.9%-24.3% vs. 15.3%-20.7%); viral/chlamydial infections (24.2%-26.6% vs. 17.7%-23.5%); and joint disorders (11.6% vs. 16.6%), and most were significantly more prevalent among cases (P < 0.05).
3::The reliability between the 2 assessments by the same evaluator on the Dolphin automatic segmentation function for volume (ICC, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95, 0.98) and minimal cross-sectional airway (ICC, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.69, 0.91) was excellent. The interoperator reliability for volume was also excellent (ICC, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95, 0.98), but only good (ICC, 0.701; 95% CI, 0.44, 0.85) for minimal cross-sectional airway. In contrast, the Spearman rank correlation test demonstrated weak associations between the values of the automatic measurements for both volume (4.9%; ρ = -0.22) and minimal cross-sectional airway (3.7%; ρ = 0.19). Assessments of accuracy via Receiver Operating characteristic analysis, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive values, positive predictive values, and likelihood ratios demonstrated the poor clinical applicability of volume and minimal cross-sectional airway numbers provided by Dolphin Imaging.
3::Women reported supplementing breast milk with water and teas soon after birth, as well as introducing small bites of solid food a few months after birth. Social norms appeared to support breastfeeding, but not exclusive breastfeeding or breastfeeding for periods longer than about a year. This may be partially explained by: a) behavioral beliefs that for the first 6 months breast milk alone is insufficient for the baby, and that water in addition to breast milk is necessary to hydrate an infant and b) normative beliefs related to the appropriateness of breastfeeding in public and as the child gets older.
3::Important differences existed between the students and nurse educators' perspectives on hindrances to the students' success. Nurse educators saw the biggest hindrance as language proficiency, whereas students saw it as lack of relationships with faculty and classmates.'
3::There was a significant difference in T2(*) reduction rates between the NLF and SLD groups (-0.2 ± 4.9% vs. 5.0 ± 6.9%, p = 0.002), and between the MLD and SLD groups (3.2 ± 6.0% vs. 5.0 ± 6.9%, p = 0.003). However, there was no significant difference in both the pre- and post-contrast T2(*) values among different liver function groups (p = 0.735 and 0.131, respectively). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve for using T2(*) reduction rates to differentiate the SLD group from the NLF group was 0.74 (95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.83).
3::Experimental tooth movements measured intraorally between cusp tips were significantly greater (25.3%) than control tooth movements. The approximate center of resistance measured radiographically also moved significantly more (about 31%) on the experimental than on the control side. The experimental premolar tipped more than the control premolar (10.5° vs 8.7°), but the difference was not statistically significant. The medullary bone volume fraction mesial to the third premolar was significantly less (9.1%) and the bone was significantly less dense (9%) on the experimental side than on the control side. Histology showed no apparent side differences in the numbers of osteoclasts and osteoblasts evident in the medullary bone.
3::447 participants were assessed with the ENLIST ENL Severity Scale. The Cronbach alpha of the scale and each item was calculated to determine the internal consistency of the scale. The ENLIST ENL Severity Scale had good internal consistency and this improved following removal of six items to give a Cronbachs alpha of 0.77. The cut off between mild ENL and more severe disease was 9 determined using ROC curves. The minimal important difference of the scale was determined to be 5 using both participant and physician ratings of change.'
3::In this study, none of the tested variables, including regulation and activation products, proved to be significantly different between the groups. Moreover, no associations with either CSC disease activity or possible CSC related steroid use were observed.
3::Ninety-nine children comprised the ASD group, and 101 children were in the control group. Our results demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of malocclusion in children with ASD compared with the control group (P <0.001). Patients with ASD were significantly more likely to have posterior crossbite (P = 0.03), increased overjet (P <0.0001), and severe maxillary crowding (P <0.01). Furthermore, children with ASD were more likely to have malocclusion than non-ASD children, independently of their demographic characteristics (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.46, -4.65).
3::Behavioral results showed that identification of the felt emotion as well as perceived intensity varies by emotion, but no significant group effect was found. Pupil measurements revealed differences in dilation depending on the emotion evoked by the film clips (happy, tender, sadness, fear, and neutral) for both groups.
3::Liver function parameters were increased in ulcerative colitis patients, and total antioxidant status, as well. Reducing power significantly decreased, but there was no significant difference compared to the control group of glutathione peroxidase and H-donor activity, we observed only tendentious decrease. The antioxidant protection of more than 54% of patients had a significantly lower rate, according to all the parameters. With chemiluminescence measurement we measured better free radical scavenging capacity, both in plasma and in erythrocytes as a result of the therapy, however, it showed an increase of superoxide dismutase activity, which warns of inflammatory processes. The cause of the decrease in bile acid levels found in the group of ulcerative colitis patients, can be the accelerated peristaltic.
3::We performed 402 observations on 240 patients. Respiratory distress was absent in 78, mild in 157, moderate in 107, and severe in 60. Respiratory rate, hypoxia, heart rate, and frequency of most signs increased as distress increased. Respiratory rate and hypoxia explained 43% of the variance in respiratory distress. Diaphoresis, gasping, and contraction of the sternomastoid explained an additional 28%. Heart rate, blood pressure, alertness, agitation, body posture, nasal flaring, audible breathing, cyanosis, tracheal tug, retractions, paradox, scalene or abdominal muscles contraction did not increase the explained variance in respiratory distress.
3::The LV myocardial thickness (SWT, 1.08 ± 0.18 cm vs. 0.90 ± 0.17 cm, p < 0.001; PWT, 0.91 ± 0.15 cm vs. 0.78 ± 0.10 cm, p < 0.001; RWT, 0.38 ± 0.08 cm vs. 0.33 ± 0.05 cm, p < 0.001), LV volume (LV end-diastolic volume, 112.9 ± 26.1 mL vs. 98.2 ± 21.0 mL, p < 0.001; LV end-systolic volume, 41.7 ± 14.7 mL vs. 33.7 ± 12.2 mL, p = 0.001) and mass (145.0 ± 29.1 g vs. 107.9 ± 20.0 g, p < 0.001) were significantly greater in men than in women. However, these differences were not significant after normalization using BSA, except for the LV mass (LV mass index, 79.6 ± 14.0 g/m(2) vs. 66.2 ± 11.0 g/m(2), p < 0.001). The cardiac output and ejection fraction were not significantly different between the men and women (cardiac output, 4.3 ± 1.0 L/min vs. 4.2 ± 0.9 L/min, p = 0.452; ejection fraction, 63.4 ± 7.7% vs. 66.4 ± 7.6%, p = 0.079). Most of the LV parameters were positively correlated with BSA, body weight, and total Agatston score.
3::A total of 206,179 procedures were analyzed. Compared with low-volume centers, high-volume centers had significantly lower observed-to-expected rates of 1-month graft loss (0.93 vs 1.18, P<0.001), 1-year graft loss (0.97 vs 1.12, P<0.001), 1-month patient death (0.90 vs 1.29, P=0.005), and 1-year patient death (0.95 vs 1.15, P=0.001). Low-volume centers were frequently in close proximity to higher volume centers, with a median distance of 7 miles (interquartile range: 2 to 75).
3::In all, 83 patients were analyzed with median (interquartile ranges) age 8 (4-12) and Injury Severity Score 22 (13-34), 73.5% blunt mechanism, 47% severe TBI, 20.5% massively transfused. Outcomes were 14.5% mortality, 43.7% disability, and 9.8% deep vein thrombosis. Remaining in or trending to SD was associated with death (P = 0.007), disability (P = 0.012), and deep vein thrombosis (P = 0.048). Median LY30 was lower on post-trauma day (PTD)1 to PTD4 in patients with poor compared with good outcome; median LY30 was lower on PTD1 to PTD3 in TBI patients compared with non-TBI patients. HF without associated shutdown was not related to poor outcome, but extreme HF (LY30 >30%, n = 3) was lethal. Also, 50% of massively transfused patients in hemorrhagic shock demonstrated SD physiology on admission. All with HF (fc31.2%) corrected after hemostatic resuscitation without tranexamic acid.
3::Four comparative cohort studies (n = 649 eyes) comparing the outcome of EK with repeat PK after failed PK were included in this review. These studies were considered high quality, with NOS scores ranging from 6 to 9. The EK group showed a significantly lower risk of graft rejection than the repeat PK group [0.43 (95% CI: 0.23-0.80, P = 0.007)]. In addition, no significant differences were observed in a comparison of graft survival and visual acuity (P values ranged from 0.81 to 0.97 using the Der-Simonian and Laird random-effects model).
3::Self-reported delusions were associated with violent ideation (odds ratio [OR]=3.08), damaging property (OR=8.24), and physical aggression (OR=12.39). Alcohol and cigarette cravings were associated with violent ideation (OR=5.20 and OR=6.08, respectively), damaging property (OR=3.71 and OR=4.26, respectively), threatening others (OR=3.62 and OR=3.04, respectively), and physical aggression (OR=6.26, and OR=8.02, respectively). Drug cravings were associated with violent ideation (OR=2.76) and damaging property (OR=5.09). Decreased variability in physical activity and noisy ward conditions were associated with violent ideation (OR=.71 and OR=2.82, respectively).
3::From 1992 to 2015, 1023 patients were identified, of whom 613 (60%) recurred at a median follow-up of 50 months. CRS was well validated in that all 3 factors remained independent predictors of recurrence beyond MC (hazard ratio 1.5-2.1, all P < 0.001) and accurately stratified recurrence risk beyond MC, ranging from 19% (CRS 0) to 67% (CRS 3) at 5 years. Among patients with CRS 0, no other factors were significantly associated with recurrence beyond MC. The majority recurred within 2 years. After 2 years of recurrence-free survival, the cumulative risk of recurrence beyond MC within the next 5 years for all patients was 14%. This risk was 12% for patients with initial disease within MC and 17% for patients with initial disease beyond MC.
3::In the pre-vaccine era, a total of approximately 107,600 (95% confidence interval [CI] 83,000-140,000) cases of severe hospitalised pneumococcal disease were estimated to have occurred annually. Following PCV introduction and the improvement in HIV interventions, 41,800 (95% CI 28,000-50,000) severe pneumococcal disease cases were estimated in 2012-2013, a rate reduction of 1,277 cases per 100,000 child-years. Approximately 5000 (95% CI 3000-6000) pneumococcal-related annual deaths were estimated in the pre-vaccine period and 1,900 (95% CI 1000-2500) in 2012-2013, a mortality rate difference of 61 per 100,000 child-years.
3::The pattern of comorbidities appeared important in predicting clinical service, with Neurologists managing the epilepsy of relatively more of those with neurological comorbidities whilst CIDTs managed the epilepsy of relatively more of those with psychiatric comorbidities. Epilepsy-related outcomes, as measured by the Glasgow Epilepsy Outcome Scale 35 (GEOS-35) and the Epilepsy and Learning Disabilities Quality of Life Scale (ELDQoL) did not differ significantly between Neurology services and CIDTs.
3::Of 59,411 women who completed the prevalence screener, 5,879 women (9.9%) met the inclusion criteria for completing the survey; 1,318 women (2.2%) reported endometriosis and at least 1 hour of scheduled household chores in the past 7 days. Of these, 810 women had least 1 hour of scheduled employment in the past 7 days. Mean age was 34.6 years (standard error [SE] ± 0.32); 77.2% of the women were white; 59.3% were married or in a civil union; and 59.1% were employed full or part time. Women with endometriosis had a weekly loss of an average of 5.3 hours (SE ± 0.4) because of employment presenteeism, 1.1 hours (SE ± 0.2) of employment absenteeism, 2.3 (SE ± 0.2) hours of household presenteeism, and 2.5 (SE ± 0.2) hours of household absenteeism. Hourly losses in employment and household chore productivity were significantly greater with increasing symptom severity (mild vs. severe: 1.9 vs. 15.8 total employment hours lost and 2.5 vs. 10.1 total household hours lost; P < 0.0001). Women who experienced 3 endometriosis symptoms concurrently lost a significantly greater number of employment hours because of absenteeism and presenteeism compared with those experiencing 1 or 2 symptoms (P < 0.001). Regression analyses showed that a range of endometriosis symptoms predicted employment and household losses because of presenteeism and absenteeism.
3::During an average follow-up of 41 months, 11 of 37 patients (29.7%) experienced MACE. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, which included LV mass index, LV ejection fraction, the presence of LGE, EccSAX, ErrSAX, EllLV, and ErrLax values, indicated that the presence of LGE (hazard ratio, 42.88; p = 0.014), together with ErrLax (hazard ratio, 0.77 per 1%, p = 0.004), was a significant predictor of MACE. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated worse outcomes in patient with LGE and an ErrLax value ≤ 9.48%. Multivariable backward regression analysis revealed that ErrLax values were the only significant predictors of LV functional recovery (hazard ratio, 0.54 per 1%; p = 0.042).
3::PMP prevalence varied from 21.2% to 27.7% and from 48.5% to 58.0% in pediatric and adult Medicaid-insured patients, respectively. Among pediatric patients who started PMP (N=397,728), the proportion who had received psychotherapy before PMP varied from 21.0% in the 1999-2000 cohort to 40.0% in 2005-2007. After PMP initiation, psychotherapy prevalence was higher, with estimates ranging from 25.4% in 1999-2000 to 44.1% in 2005-2007. Among adults (N=773,205), the prevalence of psychotherapy after PMP initiation ranged from 12.6% in 1999-2001 to 19.25% in 2003-2005. Psychotherapy prevalence prior to PMP initiation varied greatly across states.
3::Significant treatment effects on the primary outcome were limited to parent ratings for the adolescent subgroup (posttreatment: -8.3; 95% CI = -14.2 to -1.9; p = .012, effect size [ES] = 0.32; follow-up: -8.6; 95% CI = -15.4 to -1.8; p = .015, ES = 0.33) and females (posttreatment: -8.9; 95% CI = -16.2 to -1.6; p = .019, ES = 0.40). Secondary outcomes indicated moderate effects on adaptive functioning and clinical severity.
3::A dose-response association was observed between higher NS and the odds of psychotic experiences at 13 years (medium NS, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.25, 95% CI 1.05-1.49; high NS, aOR 1.77, 95% CI 1.30-2.40), whereas high levels of ND predicted psychotic experiences at 18 years (aOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.10-2.07). High levels of NC (aOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.02-1.71) and NS (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.07-2.26) were associated with increased odds of high depressive symptoms at 18 years in a dose-response fashion.
3::Recruitment proved to be extremely difficult with only two patients recruited during the first two months. The pivotal issue in Center A was that an effective and established clinical service could not easily adapt to the needs of the RCT. There was little scope to present RCT details or ensure efficient eligibility assessment, and recruiters struggled to convey equipoise. Following presentation of QRI findings, recruitment in Center A increased from 9% in the first two months (2/22) to 40% (26/65) in the four months thereafter. Center B, commencing recruitment three months after Center A, learnt from the emerging issues in Center A and set up a special clinic for trial recruitment. The trial successfully completed pilot recruitment and progressed to the main phase across 11 centers.
3::A recent patient-level meta-analysis was selected for critical appraisal. The study compared the visual recovery rates after IV thrombolysis in CRAO against the natural history of this illness and conservative therapies (ocular massage, anterior chamber paracentesis, and/or hemodilution). Time to thrombolytic therapy administration had a significant impact on visual recovery in CRAO (P<0.001). IV thrombolysis within the first 4.5 hours after symptom onset resulted in recovery of vision in 50.0% of the patients [95% confidence interval (CI), 32.4%-67.6%]. The rate of visual recovery was nearly 3 times higher than in the natural history cohort [odds ratio, 4.7 (95% CI, 2.3-9.6); P<0.001], with a 32.3% absolute risk reduction and a number needed to treat of 4.0 (95% CI, 2.6-6.6). There was no significant difference in the recovery rate after thrombolysis compared with the natural history cohort for those patients treated after 4.5 hours. No major hemorrhages occurred after alteplase administration in this meta-analysis.
3::Of the 1 429 652 births included in the sample, 5373 births were in 3586 women with epilepsy; mean (SD) age at first delivery of the epilepsy cohort was 30.54 (5.18) years. Compared with pregnancies of women without epilepsy, women with epilepsy were at increased risks of adverse pregnancy and delivery outcomes, including preeclampsia (aRR 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.43), infection (aRR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.43-2.29), placental abruption (aRR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.18-2.38), induction (aRR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21-1.40), elective cesarean section (aRR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.45-1.71), and emergency cesarean section (aRR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00-1.20). Infants of mothers with epilepsy were at increased risks of stillbirth (aRR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.05-2.30), having both medically indicated (aRR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.43) and spontaneous (aRR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.20-1.53) preterm birth, being small for gestational age at birth (aRR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.13-1.30), and having neonatal infections (aRR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.17-1.73), any congenital malformation (aRR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.35-1.62), major malformations (aRR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.43-1.81), asphyxia-related complications (aRR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.26-2.42), Apgar score of 4 to 6 at 5 minutes (aRR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03-1.76), Apgar score of 0 to 3 at 5 minutes (aRR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.62-3.61), neonatal hypoglycemia (aRR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.34-1.75), and respiratory distress syndrome (aRR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.30-1.68) compared with infants of unaffected women. In women with epilepsy, using AEDs during pregnancy did not increase the risks of pregnancy and perinatal complications, except for a higher rate of induction of labor (aRR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.10-1.55).
3::Of the 501 patients randomized (mean age, 45.9 years; 53.7% men), 395 (78.8%) completed the trial. During the maintenance period, the rates of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia were 2200.9 episodes per 100 person-years exposure (PYE) in the insulin degludec group vs 2462.7 episodes per 100 PYE in the insulin glargine U100 group for a rate ratio (RR) of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85-0.94; P < .001 for noninferiority; P < .001 for superiority; rate difference, -130.31 episodes per 100 PYE; 95% CI, -193.5 to -67.16). The rates of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia were 277.1 per 100 PYE in the insulin degludec group vs 428.6 episodes per 100 PYE in the insulin glargine U100 group, for an RR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.56-0.73; P < .001 for noninferiority; P < .001 for superiority; rate difference, -61.94 episodes per 100 PYE; 95% CI, -83.85 to -40.03). A lower proportion of patients in the insulin degludec than in the insulin glargine U100 group experienced severe hypoglycemia during the maintenance period (10.3%, 95% CI, 7.3%-13.3% vs 17.1%, 95% CI, 13.4%-20.8%, respectively; McNemar P = .002; risk difference, -6.8%; 95% CI, -10.8% to -2.7%).'
3::No significant difference was found in vascular risk factors, years of education, or underlying cognitive function between the 2 groups. More than half of the patients in each group performed preceding Valsalva-associated activities. Multiple hippocampal lesions or concomitant lesions in the cingulate gyrus were found only in the TGA group.
3::The trial was stopped for safety and futility in November 2013 after 364 of the planned 726 infants were enrolled. Among 347 infants (95%) with primary outcome data (mean age at follow-up, 20.7 [SD, 3.5] months; 42% female), death or disability occurred in 56 of 176 (31.8%) cooled for 72 hours and 54 of 171 (31.6%) cooled for 120 hours (adjusted risk ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.68-1.25]; adjusted absolute risk difference, -1.0% [95% CI, -10.2% to 8.1%]) and in 59 of 185 (31.9%) cooled to 33.5°C and 51 of 162 (31.5%) cooled to 32.0°C (adjusted risk ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.68-1.26]; adjusted absolute risk difference, -3.1% [95% CI, -12.3% to 6.1%]). A significant interaction between longer and deeper cooling was observed (P = .048), with primary outcome rates of 29.3% at 33.5°C for 72 hours, 34.5% at 32.0°C for 72 hours, 34.4% at 33.5°C for 120 hours, and 28.2% at 32.0°C for 120 hours.
3::From 1.08 billion prescription claims, a cohort of 1120 generic drugs was identified. After adjustment, drugs with quadropoly (HHI value of 2500, indicating relatively high levels of competition), duopoly (HHI value of 5000), near-monopoly (HHI value of 8000), and monopoly (HHI value of 10 000) levels of baseline competition were associated with price changes of -31.7% (95% CI, -34.4% to -28.9%), -11.8% (CI, -18.6% to -4.4%), 20.1% (CI, 5.5% to 36.6%), and 47.4% (CI, 25.4% to 73.2%), respectively, over the study period.
3::Among 191 women under surveillance for a median of 3.7 years who underwent treatment for HGVIN/vulvar cancer, primary vulvar lesions included VIN 2 (10, 5%), VIN 3 (102, 53%), and carcinoma (79, 41%). During follow-up, 71 (37%) had abnormal cytology, including 47 (25%) low grade, 23 (12%) high grade, and 1 (0.5%) carcinoma. Subsequent risk for VAIN 2+ was 11% (6/57) after previous hysterectomy and 8% for CIN 2+ (10/124) with intact cervix. Overall risk for CIN 3+ was 5%. Correlates of high-grade cytology after treatment for HGVIN/vulvar cancer included nonwhite race (odds ratio [OR] = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.50-7.36), immunodeficiency (OR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.76-9.94), and previous abnormal cytology (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.29-5.78). Stepwise multivariate analysis revealed immunosuppression as the only significant correlate of high-grade cytology after vulvar treatment (adjusted OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.26-10.83).
3::For the primary outcome variable (percentage of consonants correct), the significant mean change from pre- to postintervention for the intervention group (mean change = +6.15, p < .001) was comparable in magnitude to the significant change for the control group (mean change = +5.43, p < .001) with a small between-groups effect size for change (Cohens d = 0.08). Similar results occurred for measures of emergent literacy, phonological processing, participation, and well-being.'
3::Overall, 1,456 records (1,199 from electronic databases and 257 from other sources) were initially retrieved. After analyzing 172 full text articles, 38 papers describing fifteen disinvestment programs/experiences in eight countries were included. The majority (12/15) of disinvestment programs began after 2006. As expected, these programs were more common in developed countries, 63 percent of which had a Beveridge model healthcare system. The univariate analysis showed that countries with disinvestment programs had a significantly higher level of Human Development Index, Gross Domestic Product per capita, public expenditure on health and social services, life expectancy at birth and a lower level of infant mortality rate, and of perceived corruption. The existence of HTA agencies in the country was a strong predictor (p = .034) for the development of disinvestment programs.
3::IC50 values obtained were 11.40, 27.31, 15.93 and 15.70 μM for lymphocytes, K562, HL-60 and Jurkat cells, respectively. In K562 cells, 4-NRC (27 μM) promoted apoptosis as verified by cellular morphological changes, a significant increase in PS externalization and sub-G1 cells. Moreover, it significantly arrested the cells at the G0/G1 phase due to a reduction in cyclin D1 expression. These effects of 4-NRC also significantly promoted a reduction in mitochondrial activity and membrane depolarization, accumulation of cytosolic cytochrome c and ROS overproduction. Additionally, it triggered an increase in caspases -3/7, -8 and -9 activities. When the cells were pretreated with N-acetyl-l-cysteine ROS scavenger, 4-NRC-induced apoptosis was partially blocked, which suggests that it exerts cytotoxicity though not exclusively through ROS-mediated mechanisms.
3::Compared to HCs, patients with NMOSD had significantly lower mean global fractional anisotropy, higher mean diffusivity and radial diffusivity, and no significant differences in axial diffusivity in their NAWM. Patients with MS demonstrated significantly lower mean global fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity in the NAWM than did patients with NMOSD and HCs. Compared to patients with NMOSD, patients with MS had NAWM damage that was more extensive, particularly in the inferior cerebellar peduncle, external capsule, cingulum, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus and uncinate fasciculus.
3::In quiet, sentence recognition by the 11-year-old children was similar to that of adults, and misrepresented lexical tone contours did not have a detrimental effect. However, the performance of children ages 9 and 7 years was significantly poorer. The performance of all three age groups, especially the younger children, declined significantly in noise.
3::A total of 1010 patients (mean age = 45 years) participated in Italy. In total, 94% were below retirement age, and of these, 56% were employed. Employment was related to disability, and MS affected productivity at work in 77% of the patients. Overall, 96% and 65% of the patients experienced fatigue and cognitive difficulties as a problem, respectively. Mean utility and total annual costs were 0.735 and €22,900 at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 0-3, 0.534 and €40,100 at EDSS of 4-6.5, and 0.135 and €53,300 at EDSS of 7-9. The mean cost of a relapse was estimated to be €2600.
3::A total of 1856 patients (mean age: 54 years) participated in Belgium; 66% were below retirement age, and of these, 44% were employed. Employment was related to disease severity, and MS affected productivity at work in 85% of the patients. Overall, 95% and 72% of the patients experienced fatigue and cognitive difficulties, respectively, as a problem. Mean utility and annual costs were 0.703 and €26,400 at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-3, 0.478 and €45,300 at EDSS 4-6.5, and 0.193 and €62,000 at EDSS 7-9. The mean cost of a relapse was estimated to be €3000.
3::A total of 721 patients (mean age 48 years) participated in Switzerland; 90% were below retirement age, and of these, 65% were employed. Employment was related to disease severity, and MS affected productivity at work for 69% of patients. Overall, 93% and 64% of patients experienced fatigue and cognition as a problem, respectively. The mean utility and annual costs were 0.799 and 29,600CHF at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-3, 0.614 and 66,800CHF at EDSS 4-6.5 and 0.348 and 110,800CHF at EDSS 7-9, respectively. The mean cost of a relapse was estimated at 7600CHF.
3::At visit 1, patients with PAH showed impaired functional capacity (mean 6-min walk distance, 371 ± 131 m), increased PASP (mean, 54 ± 26 mm Hg), and borderline RVFWS (mean, 18 ± 6%). Patients before PAH therapy showed more pronounced reduction in 6-min walk distance (mean, 302 ± 136 m) and RVFWS (mean, 16 ± 5%). RVFWS at baseline was associated with PASP (R(2) = 0.25, P = .001), RV end-diastolic area (R(2) = 0.36, P < .001), and fractional area change (R(2) = 0.21, P < .001). Change in RVFWS was more strongly associated with ΔPASP (std β = -0.20, P = .02) than ΔPASP squared (std β = 0.11, P = .20). RVFWS showed strength over fractional area change for sequential RV assessment over a range of PASP changes.
3::A total of 16,808 patients in 16 countries participated in the study: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
3::A total of 208 patients (mean age: 38.5 years) participated in the Russian study; 97% were below retirement age, and of these, 49% were employed. MS was reported to affect productivity at work in 63% of patients. Overall, 87% and 41% of patients felt that fatigue and cognition were a problem. The mean utility and costs were 0.769 and 578,000 RUB at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-3, 0.509 and 826,000 RUB at EDSS 4-6.5, and 0.071 and 1,013,000 RUB at EDSS 7-9. The average cost of a relapse was 33,000 RUB.
3::The SVL correction resulted in insufficient accommodative response for the near object viewing distances tested. PAL 2 did significantly reduce accommodative lag for all near object distances tested. The PAL design with a more negative horizontal mean power gradient (PAL 4) provided a lower lag of accommodation when compared with PAL 2 at the shortest object distance of 25 cm (P = 0.03) and was able to reduce the lag of accommodation to a level below the depth of focus for the higher near working distances tested.
3::A total of 411 MS patients (mean age = 40 years) participated in Poland; 94% were below retirement age, and of these, 59% were employed. Employment was related to disability, and MS affected productivity for 85% of those working. Overall, 97% and 71% of patients experienced fatigue and cognition as important problems, respectively. Mean utility and total annual costs were 0.686 and 48,700 PLN at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-3, 0.521 and 59,200 PLN at EDSS 4-6.5 and 0.208 and 81,600 PLN at EDSS 7-9, respectively. The average cost of a relapse was 3,900 PLN.
3::A total of 747 patients (mean age 47 years) participated; 86% were below retirement age and of these, 49% were employed. Employment was related to disease severity, and MS affected productivity at work for 82% of those working. Overall, 92% and 66% of patients experienced fatigue and cognitive difficulties as a problem. Mean utility and annual costs were 0.832 and 257,000CZK at Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-3, 0.530 and 425,500CZK at EDSS 4-6.5 and 0.141 and 489,000CZK at EDSS 7-9. The average cost of a relapse was estimated at 12,600CZK.
3::A total of 1784 survey responses were completed of the 1888 text messages received by patients, yielding 487 menstrual patterns in 128 patients (mean [SD] age, 16.2 [2.0] years). Of the 68 patients who had a concussion, 16 (23.5%) experienced 2 or more abnormal menstrual patterns during the study period compared with 3 of 60 patients (5%) who had an orthopedic injury. Despite similar gynecologic age, body mass index, and type of sports participation between groups, the risk of 2 or more abnormal menstrual bleeding patterns after injury was significantly higher among patients with concussion than among those with an orthopedic injury (odds ratio, 5.85; 95% CI, 1.61-21.22).
3::From 2001 to 2012, the annual incidence of CDI and mrCDI per 1000 person-years increased by 42.7% (from 0.4408 to 0.6289 case) and 188.8% (from 0.0107 to 0.0309 case), respectively. The increase in mrCDI incidence was independent of known risk factors for CDI. Those who developed mrCDI were older (median age, 56.0 vs. 49.0 years; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] per 10-year increase in age, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.21 to 1.29]) and were more likely to be female (63.8% vs. 58.7%; aOR, 1.24 [CI, 1.11 to 1.38]) and to have used antibiotics (72.3% vs. 58.8%; aOR, 1.79 [CI, 1.59 to 2.01]), proton-pump inhibitors (24.6% vs. 18.2%; aOR, 1.14 [CI, 1.01 to 1.29]), or corticosteroids (18.3% vs. 13.7%; aOR, 1.15 [CI, 1.00 to 1.32]) within 90 days of CDI diagnosis. Chronic kidney disease (10.4% vs. 5.6%; aOR, 1.49 [CI, 1.24 to 1.80]) and diagnosis in a nursing home (2.1% vs. 0.6%; aOR, 1.99 [CI, 1.34 to 2.93]) were also associated with increased risk for mrCDI.
3::Fifteen studies of 76 pediatric patients with AIH were included in the review. Overall response rates at 6 months were estimated as 36% for mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (N = 34, 95% confidence interval [CI] (16-57)), and 50% for tacrolimus (N = 4, 95% CI (0-100%)) and 83% for cyclosporine (N = 15, 95% CI (66%-100%)). Adverse effects were most frequent with cyclosporine (64% experiencing at least 1 adverse effect) followed by tacrolimus (54%) and MMF (48%). Pooled estimates of adverse events were 78% for cyclosporine (95% CI (54%-100%)), 42% for tacrolimus (95% CI (0%-85%)) and 45% for MMF (95% CI (25%-68%)). Sensitivity analyses were not performed due to small sample size.
3::In total, 514 hand phenotypes were obtained, 384 of which could be classified in the OMT classification. A total of 1,403 diseases could be related to those CULA. A comparison with 10 recently published cases with CULA revealed that the presented phenotype matched the descriptions in our dataset. The differential diagnosis produced using our methodology was more accurate than Phenomizer in 4 of 5 examples.
3::The search yielded 122 independent studies with 1,155 comparisons. Estimated effect sizes tended to be small to medium but varied substantially across stimuli and ROIs. Overall, nonsocial ROIs yielded larger effect sizes than social ROIs; however, eye and whole-face regions from stimuli with human interaction produced the largest effects (Hedges g = 0.47 and 0.50, respectively). Studies with weaker study designs or reporting yielded larger effects, but key effects remained significant and medium in size, even for high-rigor designs.
3::Forty-one HF patients with pleural effusion were included, and twenty-eight patients (68%) survived. The multivariate logistic stepwise analysis revealed that the gestational birth week (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.96, p = 0.027) and standard deviation (SD) score of the birth weight (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.01-2.99, p = 0.045) were significant factors for postnatal death. All patients with both >32 gestational weeks and <3.0 birth weight SD score survived.
3::When stored at 2-8 °C and between -15 and -25 °C, at least 90% of the initial tacrolimus concentration remained throughout the 85-day study period. There were no significant differences in tacrolimus concentrations between the starting and ending points (p > 0.05). However, when tacrolimus solution was stored at 25 °C, the percentage of the initial tacrolimus concentration remaining had decreased to less than 90% on day 28.
3::The cohort of children was 48% non-Hispanic white, and 51% were boys. Twenty-one percent of children with ITSC scores ≥6 were obese at preschool age. Infants with ITSC scores ≥6 had 32% increased odds of being obese at preschool age (adjusted odds ratio 1.32 [95% confidence interval 1.03, 1.70]). The strongest association existed among children described as demanding attention constantly. There was no difference in the association when comparing mothers with high or low maternal sensitivity.
3::An approximate 50-fold variation in the point estimate was observed between the serotypes having the highest (7F, 38, 19A, 3, 33F) and the lowest (6C, 35B, 21, 11A, 23B and 23A) computed serotype specific invasive disease potential. In the post-PCV13 era (6C, 35B, 11A, 23B and 23A), 5 of the 7 most common serotypes colonizing the nasopharynx were serotypes with the lowest invasive capacity. Serotype specific invasive capacity trended down in older children for majority of the serotypes, and serotypes 3, 10A and 19A had significantly lower invasive capacity in children older than 24months of age compared to younger children.
3::The postoperative complication rate was 1.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3%-2.5%). Postoperative infection rate was 1.6% and surgical complication rate was 0.3%. Median adjusted standardized cost was $4112.5 (interquartile range: $2979-$6049). Patients with more than 1 diagnosis had 19 times higher risk of complications and were associated with 13% more hospital cost than those with syndactyly as single diagnosis ( P < .001). Finally, there was a wide variation in cost across hospitals; 8 (21%) yielded confidence limits above the benchmarked value.
3::The analysis included 271 patients (145 pre-intervention and 126 post-intervention). The average wait time in the pre-intervention group was 6.5 ± 2.1 (mean ± SD) minutes compared to 16.2 ± 3.2 min (P < 0.001) post intervention, and clinic times increased from 83.0 ± 29.6 min to 91.7 ±22.5 min (P < 0.007) from the pre- to post-intervention group, respectively. In adjusted regression analysis, there was no significant change in FEV1 % predicted between the two groups.
3::The levels of TNF-α, IL-1beta, IL-8, IL-6, IL-12, MCP-1, and leptin decreased after withdrawal and remained low until M6, regardless of alcohol consumption. IFN-gamma levels remained constant and IL-10 levels changed only slightly. NSE levels were not modified, whereas serum S100-β concentration increased significantly on M1 and then gell, regardless of abstinence status at six months.
3::DASH scores initially improved postoperatively but were not statistically significant. Grip strength was 60% of contralateral side. Postoperative range of motion at 6 months was flexion 40.3°, extension 39.3°, supination 87.0°, pronation 77.8°, radial deviation 14.5°, and ulnar deviation 13.8°. A 45% failure rate was observed. Complications included failure with conversion to Total Wrist Arthroplasty (TWA; n = 2) or wrist fusion (n = 3) secondary to development of ulnar-sided wrist pain. One additional patient experienced severe wrist pain but declined additional surgery.
3::In all ten corneoscleral rims the technique successfully created a visible pre-Descemetic (Type 1) bubble that could be expanded up to the predicted diameter of trephination. Subsequent trephination and the removal of corneal stroma were uneventful. In two out of four clinical cases, a type 1 bubble was created, while in two others, visco-dissection failed, and dyed viscoelastic was seen in the AC.
3::The mean FOM (all lesions, 0.984; lesions ≤ 3 mm, 0.980) and sensitivity ([reader 1: all lesions, 97.3%; lesions ≤ 3 mm, 96.2%], [reader 2: all lesions, 97.0%; lesions ≤ 3 mm, 95.8%]) of MIP iMSDE-TSE was comparable to the mean FOM (0.985, 0.977) and sensitivity ([reader 1: 96.7, 99.0%], [reader 2: 97, 95.3%]) of non-MIP iMSDE-TSE, but they were superior to those of non-MIP and MIP 3D-GREs (all, p < 0.001). The reading time of MIP iMSDE-TSE (reader 1: 47.7 ± 35.9 seconds; reader 2: 44.7 ± 23.6 seconds) was significantly shorter than that of non-MIP iMSDE-TSE (reader 1: 78.8 ± 43.7 seconds, p = 0.01; reader 2: 82.9 ± 39.9 seconds, p < 0.001). Interobserver agreement was excellent (κ > 0.75) for all lesions in both sequences.
3::There were 78 patients: 31 MAC and 47 WALANT. The MAC group averaged 27.2 minutes of OR time; the WALANT group averaged 25.2 minutes. The MAC group surgical time was 10.2 minutes versus WALANT of 10.4 minutes. Post-operatively, the MAC group averaged 72.3 minutes in the recovery room compared with WALANT group of 30.2 minutes. Each case performed under MAC had a minimum of excess charges from anesthesia of approximately $105.
3::There were 15 male and 3 females, average age of 42 years. Two-handed sports such as golf and baseball accounted for more than 60% of the cases, and these cases were the only ones that involved the lead nondominant hand, pain predominantly at impact. Delay in diagnosis averaged greater than 7 months, with triangular fibrocartilage (TFCC) and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) accounting for more than 50% of misdiagnoses. Physical findings of note included pain over the TH joint, worse with passive dorsiflexion and ulnar deviation. Radiographic findings are described. Instillation of lidocaine with the wrist in radial deviation under fluoroscopic imaging with relief of pain helped to confirm the diagnosis. Conservative treatment was successful in 9 of 18 patients (50%), whereas in the remaining, surgical intervention allowed approximately 80% return to full activities without limitation.
3::Children with OSA had significantly higher levels of BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, and total BCAAs) compared with those without OSA (P = 0.024). A positive significant correlation was observed between insulin levels and both leucine and isoleucine (r = 0.232; P < 0.05). On multivariate regression analyses, the presence of OSA was significantly associated with leucine, isoleucine, and total BCAA concentrations (P = 0.028), whereas the arousal index was associated with leucine, valine, and total BCAA levels (P = 0.037).
3::A total of 397 participants responded to the survey. Mean age was 32.5 years with males comprising 85%. No significant differences in demographics or climbing behaviors were found between males and females. Ninety percent of participants reported sustaining an upper extremity injury. Fingers were the most common injury followed by shoulder/arm and elbow/forearm. Our study found females to be more likely to report a rock climbing-related injury, and more likely to undergo surgery for it.
3::A total of 737 patients with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease or skin biopsy-confirmed dermatitis herpetiformis were included. Patients lost to follow-up, or with insufficient data were excluded leaving 328 patients (157 pediatrics younger than 18 years). For pediatrics, the female to male ratio was 2:1 and the mean age at diagnosis was 8.9 years. For adults, 4:1 and 40.6 years old. Extraintestinal symptom rates were similar in children (60%) and adults (62%). Short stature (33%), fatigue (28%), and headache (20%) were most common in children. Iron deficiency anemia (48%), fatigue (37%), and headache/psychiatric disorders (24%) were common in adults. Children had faster/higher rates of symptom resolution compared with adults. Twenty-eight percent of children with unresolved short stature on a GFD were found to have other comorbidities.
3::Overall, 35% of cases were biopsied according to the 2006 American Gastroenterological Association guidelines for CD diagnosis; 8% were biopsied according to the 2007 American Gastroenterological Association EoE consensus recommendations. Detection of CD and EoE increased with the number of biopsies collected (P for trend in each <0.001). Adherence to diagnostic guidelines was particularly poor among those found to have histologically normal mucosa in both cohorts. The likelihood of CD and EoE diagnosis was significantly associated with adherence to diagnostic guidelines (odds ratio for CD 6.3, 95% confidence interval 4.4-8.9; odds ratio for EoE 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.9-2.9).
3::Positive FLG and negative POSTN staining were observed in all esophageal biopsies from normal controls. In contrast, FLG and POSTN stained negative and positive, respectively, in all pretreatment biopsies obtained from patients with EoE, whereas FLG and POSTN stained positive in 57.1% and 95.2% of GERD cases, respectively (P < 0.001). A statistically significant decrease of the proportion of cases with negative FLG and positive POSTN staining was observed from the first (pretreatment) to the second (post-treatment) biopsy in the subgroup of patients with EoE (P < 0.001 in both correlations).
3::The study (n = 24) and control (n = 25) groups were comparable in birth characteristics (gestational age: 36.8 ± 1.9 vs 36.4 ± 1.8 weeks) and clinical condition at the time of recruitment (vital signs, clinical score, ventilation support, and blood gases). There was no difference between the study and control groups in clinical score (based on grunting, retractions, ala nasi, and respiratory rate) at recruitment and at 12, 24, and 48 h after the first inhalation (4.3 ± 1.6 vs 4.1 ± 2.1; 1.9 ± 1.8 vs 1.5 ± 1.7; 1.1 ± 1.4 vs 1.3 ± 1.6; 0.5 ± 0.8 vs 0.6 ± 1.0; respectively). Respiratory support at each time point, time to spontaneous unsupported breathing (67.4 ± 74.1 vs 75.2 ± 95.2 h), time to full feeds (86.7 ± 68.7 vs 84.3 ± 66.6 h) and length of stay (9.9 ± 5.5 vs 12.4 ± 8.0 days) did not differ between the groups. We did not detect any side effects.
3::Analogous to their promotion of low-grade inflammation, compositionally defined diet of high- and low-fat content with cellulose increased the severity of DSS-induced colitis relative to chow. However, in contrast to the case of low-grade inflammation, addition of inulin, but not the insoluble fiber cellulose, further exacerbated the severity of colitis and its associated clinical manifestations (weight loss and bleeding) in both low- and high-fat diets.
3::In 43 studies that examined cohorts of registry entries, 24 used automatic and manual processes to find articles; 3 only automatic; and 11 only manual (5 did not specify). Twelve studies reported results for both manual and automatic processes and showed that a median of 23% (range from 13 to 42%) included automatic links to articles, while 17% (range from 5 to 42%) of registry entries required manual processes to find articles. There was no evidence that the proportion of registry entries with automatic links had increased (R (2) = 0.02, p = 0.36). In 39 studies that examined cohorts of articles, 21 used automatic and manual processes; 9 only automatic; and 2 only manual (7 did not specify). Sixteen studies reported numbers for automatic and manual processes and indicated that a median of 49% (range from 8 to 97%) of articles had automatic links to registry entries, and 10% (range from 0 to 28%) required manual processes to find registry entries. There was no evidence that the proportion of articles with automatic links to registry entries had increased (R (2) = 0.01, p = 0.73).
3::Seventy patients with gastroparesis and 126 controls were included. Clinically significant endoscopic findings were noted in 35% of controls (44/126) and 43% of gastroparetics (30/70), P = 0.345. Concordance between gross and histologic findings was low at 50%. Histologic findings included gastritis 60% (17/28), esophagitis 39% (11/28), and duodenitis 7% (2/28). In univariate and multivariate analyses, there was no meaningful correlation between symptoms and/or screening laboratory values and diagnosis of gastroparesis.
3::According to the binary grading system of WHO, 69 (49.28%) cases were LRED, while 71 (50.71%) case showed HRED. There was significant increase in Ki67 labeling index (LI) from NOM to LRED to HRED (p=0.000). Similarly, mean vascular density (MVD) also increased significantly from NOM to LRED to HRED (p=0.000). The α-SMA expression was significantly higher in HERD compared to LRED and NOM (p=0.000). A positive correlation was noted amongst Ki67 LI, MVD and α-SMA expression in NOM, LRED and HRE (p=0.000).
3::Topical administration of medium- and high-dose CSF significantly enhanced perianal ulcer healing as compared to the untreated control (p<0.05). The macroscopic ulceration score was significantly reduced only in the high-dose CSF-treated group as compared to the control (p<0.01). All doses of CSF and PP ameliorated histological damages in the rats with induced perianal ulceration. High-dose CSF or PP significantly reduced the expression of PGE2 and IL-8 as compared to the control (p<0.01). No treatment-related toxicity was found in either the CSF- or the PP-treated mice.
3::Overall, 35 of 48 (73%) eligible patients were enrolled, including 10 requiring mechanical ventilation. Of these patients, 34 (97%) completed the 48-hour actigraphy period; 20 (57%) found the devices comfortable. Wrist devices logged a mean (SD) of 33.4 (8.8) hours of estimated sleep (72% [19%] of recording period) and 19.6 (17.2) movements per 30-second epoch. Ankle devices recorded 43.2 (4.1) hours of estimated sleep (93% [7%] of recording period) and 5.1 (6.0) movements per 30 seconds.
3::Although the 10-day administration of antibiotics reduced the stool weight per hour to half, the dewaxed brown rice and LPS groups showed a trend towards improvement at a level comparable to the group receiving no antibiotics. The body weight significantly decreased after the 27-day administration of antibiotics but was improved in the 50% dewaxed brown rice group at a level comparable to the group receiving no antibiotics. Though the defecation frequency and wet and dry stool weights per hour were reduced by as much as 50% in the group receiving antibiotics, a significant improvement in constipation was observed in the 50% dewaxed brown rice group.
3::Priming performances discriminated between individuals with MCI and mild dementia but not between MCI and healthy. Additionally, this effect was most salient in individuals with low levels of education. Education did not moderate explicit memory performances in predicting group membership.
3::The total V-V angle in the ACL-deficient knee under 5 Nm of V-V torque was significantly greater than that in the intact knee, whereas the angle in the ACL-deficient knee with 30 N of posterior tibial load was significantly smaller than that in the ACL-deficient knee and approached that in the intact knee, at both 30° and 60° of flexion. The in situ force of the ACL was approximately 30 N at 30° and 16 N at 60° of flexion under 5 Nm of both varus and valgus torques.
3::Following 7 days of space opening, the margin of the interdental papilla between the lower incisors gradually became irregular and flat indicating a condition similar to the open gingival embrasure (p<0.05). Local injection of HA filler induced augmentation effect of the interdental papilla compared to the injection of PBS (p<0.05). Interdental papilla became convex and inner granules containing HA were detected within the submucosal layer following its injection.
3::No benefit of benazepril versus placebo was detected for renal survival time in all dogs; median (95% confidence interval (CI)) survival times were 305 (53-575) days in the benazepril group and 287 (152-not available) in the placebo group (P = .53). Renal survival times were not significantly longer with benazepril compared to placebo for subgroups: hazard ratios (95% CI) were 0.50 (0.21-1.22) with P = .12 for initial urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPC) >0.5, and 0.38 (0.12-1.19) with P = .080 for initial UPC >0.5 plus plasma creatinine ≤440 μmol/L. Proteinuria, assessed from the UPC, was significantly (P = .0032) lower after treatment with benazepril compared to placebo. There were no significant differences between groups for clinical signs or frequencies of adverse events.
3::Both treatments presented statistically significant clinical and microbiological improvements. However, CLM presented lower means of pocket depth for pockets ≥ 7 mm at 6 months (4.0 ± 1.7) when compared to placebo group (4.7 ± 1.3) (p=0.04). In addition, CLM group also presented greater reduction of P. gingivalis DNA counts at 6 months (p=0.0001).
3::After 2 months of storage at ambient temperature, rice straw silages treated with additives were well-preserved, the pH values and butyric and acetic acid contents were lower, and the lactic acid content and lactic/acetic acid ratio were higher than those in the control (p<0.05). Acidity (pH) was lowest, and lactic acid highest, in 1821-treated silage (p<0.05). The NH3-N content decreased significantly in inoculant-treated silage (p<0.05) and the NH3-N content in 1821-treated silage was lowest among the treatments. The dry matter (DM) content of the control silage was lower than that of fresh rice straw (p<0.05), while that of the 1841- and p1174-inoculant-treated silages was significantly higher than that of HM/F-treated silage. Microbial additives did not have any significant (p>0.05) effect on acid detergent fiber or neutral detergent fiber contents. Crude protein (CP) content and in vitro DM digestibility (IVDMD) increased after inoculation of LAB 1821 (p<0.05).
3::Numerous treatment options have been described for metacarpal fractures, including splinting, percutaneous fixation, open reduction with internal fixation, and external fixation. All modalities are acceptable strategies for treating metacarpal fractures. The ultimate goal is to maximize hand function with minimal morbidity.
3::Over one-third of reviews (37%) did not search the CAB Abstracts database, and 9% of reviews searched only 1 database. Over two-thirds of reviews (65%) did not report any search for grey literature or stated that they excluded grey literature. The majority of reviews (95%) did not report a reproducible search strategy.
3::According to the CDC/AAP case definition, 49.5% of participants had periodontitis and 9.1% had severe periodontitis. Periodontitis prevalence and severity increased with age. The extent of BL and PD ≥ 4 mm also increased with age, but more rapidly and to a greater extent for BL. The prevalence of periodontitis was higher among men and varied between urban and rural areas. Periodontitis prevalence was positively associated with smoking, lower levels of education and income.
3::Of the 145 participants without DPN at baseline, 51 had developed DPN when examined after 4 years (35% incidence). Of the ophthalmic variables, the mean (S.D.) of the overall thickness in the parafovea at baseline was 315 (18) μm in the no DPN group and 306 (18) μm in the incidence' group, and the differences were significant, p = 0.005. The superior hemisphere parafovea (mean (S.D.): 318 (17) μm vs 310 (20) μm, p = 0.02) and inferior hemisphere parafovea (313 (19) μm vs 302 (18) μm, p = 0.002) were different in the incident DPN group compared with the no DPN group. When adjusted for age, retinal thickness in the parafovea (AUC = 0.65, p = 0.003, 86% sensitivity and 44% specificity at 321 μm criterion), and body mass index or BMI (AUC = 0.65, p = 0.003, 49% sensitivity and 83% specificity at 29.3 kg m(-2) criterion) at baseline were significant predictors for 4-year incident DPN.'
3::The expression of Rv2626c-enhanced M. smegmatis survival under hypoxia and nitric oxide stress in vitro, and this enhancement was maintained within macrophages and in mouse tissues. In addition, macrophages infected with M. smegmatis expressing Rv2626c showed significantly higher interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, as well as a higher level of cell necrosis, compared with the control.
3::One hundred one patients met inclusion criteria, of which 57.4 percent were male. Average age at the time of the most recent speech evaluation was 6.1 years (range, 2.31 to 17.95 years); 43.6 percent had normal speech/language metrics and 56.4 percent had one or more abnormalities, including anatomical motor delay/disorder (29.7 percent), language acquisition delay/disorder (21.8 percent), articulation or speech production delay/disorder (4.0 percent), hypernasality (15.8 percent), and velopharyngeal insufficiency or borderline competency (23.8 percent). Average Pittsburgh Weighted Speech Scale score was 1.3 (range, 0 to 5), and 29.7 percent (n = 30) of patients were recommended to have speech therapy. In addition, 25.8 percent of patients were diagnosed with a submucous cleft palate.
3::Findings showed that while Mav101 was very similar to Mav104, there were numerous differences between Mav104 and the remaining strains at nucleotide and predicted protein levels. The presence of genes associated with biofilm formation and several known virulence-related genes were sometimes differentially present among the isolates, suggesting overlapping functions by different genetic determinants.
3::One hundred forty-two patients were enrolled. There was significant (all p < 0.05) and progressive reduction in fat graft retention within the first 3 postoperative months, and the retained fat graft was maintained (all p > 0.05) from 3 to 12 months postoperatively, with a 12-month fat graft retention rate of 67.7 percent. Age, Parry-Romberg syndrome, previous craniofacial bone surgery, grafted volume, and forehead unit were independently negative (all p < 0.05) predictors of fat graft retention, whereas cheek unit was an independently positive (all p < 0.05) predictor of retention.
3::Of the 113 digits with Dupuytrens contracture operated on during this period, 52 involved the middle fingers (12 long and 40 ring fingers). Intrinsic muscles were found to be involved in the contracture of 14 of these digits. Two unique contracture patterns were identified: type I contracture, which involves a lateral digital cord originating from intrinsic muscle-tendon units and contracting only the proximal interphalangeal joint; and type II contracture, which involves a spiral cord receiving contribution from intrinsic muscle-tendon units and contracting both the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints. The frequency of type I and type II contractures was 6 percent and 12 percent, respectively.'
3::Patients with rCCA-occlusion showed intra-individual side differences between hemispheres, with significantly lower subcortical perfusion of the right hemisphere and reduced cortical perfusion. In one-third of patients with rCCA-occlusion, rCBF of the right-hemisphere was reduced by more than 20% when compared to the left hemisphere. Despite intra-individual side differences, mean rCBF in patients with rCCA occlusion was not reduced compared to controls.
3::On average, the oxygen-sensing paint-on bandage measured a decrease in transdermal oxygenation from 85.2 mmHg to 64.1 mmHg upon aortic ligation. The oxygen-sensing dye restored at 81.2 mmHg after unclamping. Responses in both control groups demonstrated a similar trend. Physiologic changes from normal to ischemic and reperfused conditions were statistically significantly different in all three techniques (p < 0.001).
3::The sensitivity and precision of published sex or gender filters varied across topics. Sensitivity values ranged from 14.3% to 92.5%, while precision varied from 17.9% to 51.4%. These filters were less sensitive and less precise in their identification of relevant studies than has been reported in previous studies. Further, while the MEDLINE Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term ""Sex Factors"" achieved the greatest average precision (59.3%) of any individual filter term, the MEDLINE check tag ""Female"" returned the highest average sensitivity (90.1%), with an average precision of 25.0% across topics.
3::By Western blot, bands were detected at the expected molecular weight for TRPA1. TRPA1- and TRPV1-immunoreactivities were located on CGRP-positive nerves, but not on TH-positive nerves. TRPA1 was also located in vimentin-positive interstitial cells. In functional experiments, neither of the TRPA1-agonists (1-100 μM) had any direct effects on ureter tension (baseline/potassium-induced contractions). However, CA, AI, NaHS, and capsaicin (10 μM) decreased (P < 0.01-0.05) tetrodotoxin-sensitive electrically induced (2,4,8,16,32 Hz) contractions. Inhibitory activities were 50-61% (CA), 30-56% (AI), 30-40% (NaHS), and 37-67% (Capsaicin).
3::Over a 36-month period, 42 patients met inclusion criteria (one man and 41 women), with an average age of 35 ± 11.4 years (range, 20 to 60 years). Comorbidities included four active smokers, two patients with hypertension, and one patient with diabetes. Average body mass index was 29 ± 4.4 kg/m (range, 22 to 38 kg/m). Procedures performed abroad included abdominoplasty (n = 28), liposuction (n = 20), buttock augmentation (n = 10), and breast augmentation (n = 7), with several patients undergoing combined procedures. Eleven patients presented with abscesses and eight presented with wound dehiscence. Eight of the 18 patients who were surveyed were not pleased with their results and 11 would not go abroad again for subsequent procedures. Average cost of treating the complications was $18,211, with an estimated cost to the U.S. health care system of $1.33 billion. The main payer group was Medicaid.
3::Growing performance was higher (p<0.05) in the CON group compared to the TMR group during fattening and finishing periods. The CON group was lower (p<0.05) in blood aspartic acid transaminase, blood urea nitrogen and retinol levels during growing period, but higher in triglyceride and cholesterol levels during fattening and finishing periods compared to the TMR group. The CON group was greater (p<0.05) in rib-eye area, and lighter (p<0.05) red in meat color compared to the TMR group. In the correlation coefficients between blood components of steers and carcass traits, retinol had a negative (p<0.05) correlation with marbling score and rib-eye area. Leptin had a positive (p<0.05) correlation with back fat thickness. Blood cholesterol and triglyceride were positively (p<0.05) correlated with carcass weight and rib-eye area.
3::The team identified a total of six competencies for librarian involvement in systematic reviews: ""Systematic review foundations,"" ""Process management and communication,"" ""Research methodology,"" ""Comprehensive searching,"" ""Data management,"" and ""Reporting."" Within each competency are the associated skills and knowledge pieces (indicators). Competence can be measured using an adaptation of Millers Pyramid for Clinical Assessment, either through self-assessment or identification of formal assessment instruments.'
3::The Cardiff Acuity Test over-estimated VA compared with the Lea Symbols and ETDRS charts in both focused and defocused conditions. The mean difference between the Cardiff Acuity Test and the ETDRS chart was 0.31 logMAR (95% limits of agreement (LOA) 0.10-0.52 logMAR) in focused conditions and 0.64 logMAR (95% LOA 0.25-1.05 logMAR) with 3D of spherical defocus. Defocus degraded VA on all charts, however there was a significant chart-by-defocus interaction whereby the Cardiff Acuity Test was more resistant to the effects of both spherical (P < 0.0001) and cylindrical (P < 0.001) optical defocus than the recognition acuity tasks at all defocus levels.
3::A total of 307 children participated in the Childhood Health, Activity, and Motor Performance School (CHAMPS) Eye Study. The cycloplegic spherical equivalent (SE) was 0.30 ± 1.46 dioptres. The prevalence of myopia was 17.9% (SE ≤-0.5 dioptres). Mean axial length (AL) was 23.5 ± 0.9 mm. For all participants, the overall mean daily distribution of PA was 67.2% in sedentary, 25.6% in light, 4.4% in moderate and 2.9% in vigorous PA. Age- and sex-adjusted linear regression showed no association between PA and SE or AL. In a prospective slope analysis, there was no association between accumulated PA during the 7 years and AL or SE.
3::A total of 8 eyes of 5 patients developed a fixed and dilated pupil after TSCPC, unresponsive to light. A mydriatic pupil could still be observed at least 6 months after treatment in 7 of 8 eyes; however, it was asymptomatic.
3::Cross-sectional area of the condyle ipsilateral to the atretic ear was, on average, 8.41 mm(2) smaller than the contralateral condyle (P < .0001). The Jahrsdoerfer score was not associated with the condylar cross-sectional area, age, or sex.
3::Over the study period, the mean RBC units transfused per admission decreased 39% from 6.1 to 3.7 (p < 0.001), and the mean PLT units transfused decreased 35% from 6.3 to 4.1 (p < 0.001), with mean RBC and PLT units transfused for follow-up day cases decreasing from 0.6 to 0.4 units (p < 0.001). Mean pre-RBC transfusion Hb level decreased from 8.0 to 6.8 g/dL (p < 0.001), and single-unit RBC transfusions increased 39% to 67% (p < 0.001). This reduction represents blood product cost savings of AU$694,886 (US$654,007). There were no significant changes in unadjusted or adjusted length of stay, serious bleeding events, or in-hospital mortality over the study.
3::Serial assessments resulted in more than 2100 pupillometer readings from 76 subjects. Mean age of the study sample was 55.4 years, with a mean Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8.9. The mean pupillometer values for the enrolled subjects included left constriction velocity of 1.22, left neurological pupil index of 4.21, left pupil size of 2.69, right constriction velocity of 1.18, right neurological pupil index of 4.18, and right pupil size of 2.57. The mean ICP of the study sample was 12, with mean cerebral perfusion pressure of 77. Pupillometer values significantly correlated with ICP values in bivariate (P < .001, r = 0.13-0.23) and multivariate regression models (F(6) = 17.63, P < .001).
3::In total, 70 healthcare professionals participated in the survey. Of participants, 84.3% found pharmacogenomics relevant to their current practice, but experience was still rare. More than two-thirds (65.7%) did not order nor recommend a pharmacogenomic test in the past year. This was mainly attributed to not having enough knowledge on pharmacogenomics (40.0%). Needs were identified in application of pharmacogenomics (identifying drugs 41.4%, interpreting test results 37.2%) as well as in underlining mechanisms (better knowledge on drug metabolism 67.1%, better knowledge on basic principles of pharmacogenomics 60.0%).
3::Fraction F5.3 (25 mg/kg) and EASF (20 mg/kg) showed significant anxiolytic and antidepressant activity, respectively. Thin-layer chromatography and phytochemical screening demonstrated the absence of mahanimbine in M. paniculata leaves. Coumarins were observed to be responsible for the anxiolytic activity.
3::The RBC catalase concentration was significantly decreased in the DM1 and DM1 + VA groups when compared with the normal control. DM1 + OG significantly increased RBC-catalase when compared to DM1. The methemoglobin concentration was significantly reduced in the DM1, DM1 + VA, DM1 + OG + VA and DM1 + insulin groups when compared to the normal control group. The sulfhemoglobin concentration was significantly increased in the diabetic control and the diabetic treated groups when compared to the normal control. DM1 + OG reduced the sulfhemoglobin concentration when compared to DM1. The blood glucose concentration of all the diabetic groups was significantly raised compared to normal control. OG, VA and insulin significantly reduced the blood glucose concentration with the efficacy of OG and VA higher than insulin.
3::It was found that there was no single meaning of CATM among the Indonesian community of psychology. Participants were not familiar enough with the terms and tended to use them with overlap. It can be suggested that ""complementary medicine"" and ""alternative medicine"" or ""complementary-alternative medicine"" combined provides more suitable terminology for use among Indonesian psychology community when communicating with other health care professionals.
3::Between 1967 and 2012, LE increased for both NT Aboriginal and all Australians; the difference in LE between the two populations declined by 4.6 years for females, but increased by one year for males. Between 1967-1971 and 1980-1984, LE of NT Aboriginal people increased rapidly, particularly through reduced infant mortality; from 1980-1984 to 1994-1998, there was little change; from 1994-1998 to 2008-2012, there were modest gains in older age groups. Decomposition by age group identified the persistent and substantial contribution of the 35-74-year age groups to the difference in LE between NT Aboriginal people and all Australians.
3::In both Norway and Spain and across ages, negative affect predisposed children to symptoms of all disorders except CD, low effortful control predisposed children to ADHD and ODD-symptoms, and surgency predisposed children to increased ADHD-symptoms. Complication effects were observed in the Spanish children for ADHD-symptoms, which increased surgency and diminished effortful control, and for ODD-symptoms, which decreased surgency. The common cause and pathoplasty/exacerbation explanations were not supported.
3::The manual did not show a statistical significant difference with rotary instrumentation (P > 0.05), but higher CHX substantivity was recorded in all periods of observation when compared to reciprocating instrumentation (P < 0.05).
3::Three compounds were isolated and identified: a sterol, (1) stigmasterol-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside; a pregnane glucoside, (2) pregn-5-ene-3β,16β,20(R)-trio1-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside; a furostanol saponin, (3) 26-(O-β-d-glucopyranosyl)-22-O-methylfurost-5-ene-3β,26-diol-3-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 4)-[α-l-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 → 2)]-β-d-glucopyranoside. Only compound 3 possessed significant AG and AR inhibitory activities (IC50 = 3.12 ± 0.17 and 1.04 ± 0.02 μg/mL, respectively), while compounds 1 and 2 were inactive. The in vivo antidiabetic study revealed that MeEx and furostanol saponin 3 possessed significant activities at a dose of 200 mg/kg through reducing the fasting plasma glucose level by 46.14% and 51.39%, respectively, as well as reducing the total cholesterol by 24.44% and 31.90%, respectively. Compound 3 also caused increment in insulin and C-peptide levels by 63.56% and 65%, respectively.
3::Mean scores (SD/SEM) for the contrast agents (n = 50) were iopamidol = 21.0 (8.4/1.2); iohexol = 21.8 (7.1/1.0); Gastrografin = 16.8 (9.6/1.4); and barium = 23.7 (9.1/1.3). One-way ANOVA equality of means test shows rejection of the hypothesis that the means are equal (F* = 6.550, p = .000). Post hoc testing demonstrates Gastrografin to be significantly less preferred to barium (p = .000) and iohexol (p = .012). No difference was found between iopamidol and iohexol (p = .959). One-way ANOVA equality of means test of just iopamidol, iohexol, and barium does not reject the hypothesis that means are equal (F* = 1.778 and p = .174).
3::Of 375 HIV-negative MSM enrolled in Amsterdam PrEP, 18 (4.8%, 95% confidence interval 2.9-7.5%) of participants were anti-HCV and/or HCV RNA positive at enrolment; 15 of 18 (83%) had detectable HCV RNA. HCV genotyping showed genotype 1a (73%), 4d (20%), and 2b (7%). All HCV-positive MSM starting PrEP were part of MSM-specific HCV clusters containing MSM with and without HIV.
3::We show that GCV has a direct suppressive activity on HIV replication in human tissues ex vivo, including laboratory strains, drug-resistant and primate HIV-1 isolates. We deciphered the mechanism of this inhibition and showed that GCV-TP is incorporated in the nascent DNA chain and acts as a delayed chain terminator.
3::Strong unmatched U.S. seniors submitted significantly more applications to achieve and attend approximately the same number of interviews as strong matched U.S. seniors. Strong unmatched seniors ranked fewer programs than their matched counterparts. As a group, unmatched U.S. seniors were less likely than their matched counterparts to rank a mix of competitive and less competitive programs and more likely to rank programs based on their perceived likelihood of matching. A small number of unmatched U.S. seniors would have matched if they had ranked programs that ranked them.
3::The raMOLLI sequence allowed a significant decrease of myocardial T1 map acquisition time down to five heartbeats, while exhibiting a higher degree of accuracy and a comparable precision on T1 value estimation than the conventional modified Look-Locker inversion recovery sequence. The FLASH readout demonstrated a better robustness to B0 inhomogeneities than TrueFISP, and was therefore preferred for in vivo acquisitions.
3::Subjects wore the blue-blocking glasses 3:57 ± 1:03 h each night. After the experimental period, the pupil showed a slower redilation phase, resulting in a significantly increased 30 s post illumination pupil response to one-second short wavelength light, and decreased area under the curve for one and five-second short wavelength light, when measured at the same time of day as baseline. Night time melatonin increased from 16.1 ± 7.5 pg mL(-1) to 25.5 ± 10.7 pg mL(-1) (P < 0.01). Objectively measured sleep duration increased 24 min, from 408.7 ± 44.9 to 431.5 ± 42.9 min (P < 0.001). Mean PSQI score improved from 5.6 ± 2.9 to 3.0 ± 2.2.
3::Retinal haemorrhage (RH) was found in 550 (18%) of 3123 high-risk infants. Retinal haemorrhage (RH) was classified as grade I (39%), grade II (24%) and grade III (37%). Monocular RH occurred in 37% of cases, while the remaining cases were binocular. Moreover, six cases had vitreous haemorrhage. The following parameters correlated (p < 0.05) with RH in this study: delivery mode (χ(2)  = 469), gestational age (χ(2)  = 35), birth weight (χ(2)  = 18), asphyxia (χ(2)  = 73), scalp hematoma (χ(2)  = 55), maternal age (χ(2)  = 8.9), precipitate labour (χ(2)  = 120) and delivery times (χ(2)  = 6.1). Logistic regression analysis indicated that delivery mode and asphyxia were risk factors for RH in high-risk infants, with odds ratios of 0.827 and 2.5, respectively. Gender, intracranial haemorrhage and foetal distress were not correlated with RH in high-risk infants.
3::Significant differences were detected in regular astigmatism, asymmetry and higher order irregularities among groups. For the SKC group, the parameters with high diagnostic ability (AUC > 90%) were the higher order irregularities, the asymmetry and the regular astigmatism, mainly in the corneal periphery. Higher predictive accuracy was identified using diagnostic models that combined the asymmetry, regular astigmatism and higher order irregularities in averaged 3and 4 mm area (AUC: 98.4%, Sensitivity: 91.7% and Specificity:100%).
3::One hundred and seventy-two IBS patients (Rome III; 69% female; mean age 33.7 [range 18-60] years) were included. The optimal subgrouping showed six latent groups, characterised by: (I) constipation with low comorbidities, (II) constipation with high comorbidities, (III) diarrhoea with low comorbidities, (IV) diarrhoea and pain with high comorbidities, (V) mixed GI symptoms with high comorbidities, (VI) a mix of symptoms with overall mild severity. The subgroups showed differences in the distribution of Rome III-subtypes, IBS severity, presence of anxiety and depression, and gender, but not regarding age, IBS duration or reported post-infectious onset of IBS.
3::The quality of bowel cleansing, evaluated using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS), was significantly higher in the smartphone app group than in the control group (7.70±1.1 vs. 7.24±0.8, respectively, p=0.007 by t-test). No significant differences were found between the two groups regarding work-up time and the number of patients with polyps.
3::One hundred eighty-two women participated in the survey. The majority were white (83.52%), married (52.49%), had ≥1 pregnancy (54.40%), and in excellent health (93.41%). The average age and body mass index were 47.28 ± 13.56 years and 27.92 ± 6.78, respectively. The sample was further sub-divided into two groups: urinary urgency (N = 119) or no urinary urgency symptoms (N = 51). Habitual toileting behaviors for these groups (N = 170) included: sitting to urinate at home (98.24%), emptying the bladder completely (88.82%), emptying the bladder before leaving home (80.00%), and sitting to urinate when away from home (68.82%). Logistic regression analysis showed age increased the odds of urinary urgency (aOR 1.06, 95%CI 1.02-1.09). Women who waited too long to urinate at work (aOR 7.85, 95%CI 1.57-39.24) and wore panty liners for urinary leakage (aOR 2.86, 95%CI 1.25-6.56) had greater odds of urinary urgency than women who did neither.
3::Totally, 17 patients (7 in LVD and 10 in ETV group) were recruited, and 3 patients (17.7%) died or received liver transplantation due to hepatic failure. The median HBV DNA decline on days 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 85, and 180 were 1.38 (1.09-1.50), 2.36 (1.89-2.58), 3.19 (2.21-3.51), 3.76 (2.54-4.40), 3.43 (2.44-4.75), 4.00 (3.01-5.04), 5.00 (3.61-6.21), and 6.50 (4.12-7.20) log IU/mL, respectively. The baseline characteristics were basically similar between the two groups, and the dynamic changes in HBV DNA were not significantly different between the two groups. Further analysis of the patients with high HBV viral load (>6 log IU/mL) revealed that a similar baseline HBV DNA level in the two groups (LVD vs ETV: median 8.0 [7.5-8.8] vs 7.7 [6.6-8.4] log IU/mL; P=0.45), and the dynamic changes of HBV DNA were very similar.
3::Outbreaks of sarcoptic mange were found to occur in koalas from both Victoria (n = 29) and South Australia (n = 29) for the first time. The gross pathological and histopathological changes are described.
3::Perceived weight discrimination was associated with increased risk of cigarette smoking (odds ratio [OR] = 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36-1.99), driving while intoxicated (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.60-2.54), risky sexual/drug use behaviors (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.69-2.80), and not using a seat belt (OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.15-2.03). With the exception of seat belt use, all associations remained significant controlling for depressive symptoms.
3::Forty-five patients received a total of 45 implant-based reconstructions using SurgiMend® (18 cases; 40%) or Tutomesh® (27 cases; 60%). Gross complication rates were 27.8% for SurgiMend® and 37.0% for Tutomesh® including hematoma, postoperative skin irritation, infection, red breast syndrome and revision surgery. The most common complication was postoperative red breast syndrome. Severe complications requiring revision surgery did not differ significantly in patients treated with SurgiMend® (0 cases, 0%) compared to Tutomesh® (1 case, 3.7%).
3::Stress was not related to body mass index (BMI) for African American or White women, but chronic stress was associated with higher BMI for Caribbean Black women. Stress was associated with depressive symptoms, but there was variation by the type of stressor under consideration. Physical activity was associated with fewer depressive symptoms and lower BMI, but the relationships varied by type of stressor and race/ethnicity. Physical activity moderated the effect of chronic stress on depressive symptoms and BMI, but only for African American women who reported high levels of chronic stress. Among White women, physical activity moderated the effect of racial discrimination on BMI for those who reported experiencing both high and low levels of discrimination.
3::The PA intervention had the largest benefit in participants with class 2 + obesity (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.48, 0.98). However, there was no statistically significant difference in benefit across obesity categories.
3::We found fifteen studies, including seven cohort, six cross-sectional, one case control and one randomized control trial. Coffee consumption was generally associated with a reduction in prevalence of asthma. The association of coffee with natural honey was an effective treatment for persistent post-infectious cough. One case-control study found higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with coffee consumption. No association was found with the evolution of COPD or sarcoidosis. Coffee was associated with a reduction in respiratory mortality, and one study found improved lung function in coffee consumers. Smoking was a significant confounder in most studies.
3::One hundred ninety-five cases were included. Preoperative imaging consisted of sonography (n = 169), magnetic resonance imaging (n = 152), or both (n = 126). With sonography, nipple involvement did not differ between nipple-sparing mastectomy candidates and noncandidates using a tumor-to-nipple distance cutoff of 2 cm (10.7 percent versus 10.6 percent; p = 0.988) or 1 cm (9.3 percent versus 15.0 percent; p = 0.307). With magnetic resonance imaging, nipple involvement did not differ between candidates and noncandidates using a cutoff of 2 cm (11.6 percent versus 12.5 percent; p = 0.881) or 1 cm (11.4 percent versus 13.8 percent; p = 0.718). When sonography and magnetic resonance imaging findings were both available and concordant, nipple involvement still did not differ between candidates and noncandidates using a cutoff of 2 cm (8.8 percent versus 11.8 percent; p = 0.711) or 1 cm (7.6 percent versus 14.3 percent; p = 0.535).
3::We found that 21% of the volunteers were anaemic. In 85 anaemic volunteers, they were classified as Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA); with low serum ferritin levels 42.4%, Thalassemia; total of 6 types 25.9%, IDA and Thalassemia 2.3% and Others 29.4% in which haemoglobin typing and serum ferritin level were normal.
3::The review of 49 sections (mean=16.3, range=14-20) in the three colectomies revealed 60 ulcers (mean=20, range=13-27). The following CCC phenotypes were found bordering mucosal ulcers: with asymmetric lateral fission (n=11), with dual or three-foiled corrupted fission (n=19), with cystic dilatations (n=3), L-shaped crypts (n=7), T-inverted crypts (n=6), shoe-shaped crypts (n=3), horizontal crypts (n=14), multi-lobate crypts (n=2), and/or inter-connecting crypts (n=5).
3::The 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rates in group A were 100%, 33% and 24% in group A and 47%, 7% and 0% in group B (p<0.001). In addition, complete tumor resection (p<0.001) and tumor grade III (p<0.001) were associated with improved survival.
3::The prevalence rates of being underweight and overweight, based on W/A z scores of ≤-2 and ≥2, were 8.2% and 5.7%, respectively. Patients who were underweight were younger and had a higher rate of mortality, poor outcomes, and longer duration of mechanical ventilation than those with a normal weight. The patients with mortality or major sequelae had significantly higher rates of being underweight, noninfectious diseases and hypotension, and higher Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 (PIM2) score and creatinine level (all P < .01). In multivariate logistic regression interpretation, the W/A z score ≤-2 (95% CI, 2.992-47.508; P < .001) and PIM2 score (95% CI, 1.094-1.413; P = .001) were independent risk factors for a poor outcome.
3::Initially, to know the normal range we measured AVP and CIMT in 50 patients without any major risk factors for CAD but CAG was not done. Aortic velocity propagation ranged from 46 cm/s to 76 cm/s (mean = 58.62 ± 6.46 cm/s), CIMT ranged from 0.50 mm to 0.64 mm (mean = 0.55 ± 0.03 mm). Among 100 patients who underwent CAG we found 69% had significant CAD, 13% had insignificant CAD, and 18% had normal coronaries. Those with significant CAD had significantly lower AVP (41.65 ± 4.94 cm/s) [F (2,97) = 44.05, p < 0.0001] and significantly higher CIMT (0.86 ± 0.11 mm) [F (2,97) =35.78, p < 0.0001]. AVP had significant strong negative correlation with CIMT (r = -0.836, p < 0.0001, n = 100) and SYNTAX score (r = -0.803, p < 0.0001, n = 69), while CIMT was positively correlated with SYNTAX score significantly (r = 0.828, p < 0.0001, n = 69).
3::For ESA supplementation, no difference was observed between the groups at the various observed times. Despite similar Hb levels, the patients of group A needed significant lower doses of IV iron (-57.8%) avoiding risks of organ toxicity and obtaining consequent cost saving of nearly 1 €/patient/month.
3::In the in-vitro analysis, the mean air kerma (AK) and dose area product (DAP)/frame were significantly lower with added copper filtration (protocols 3 and 4). In the in-vivo bilateral paired injections, AK and DAP/frame were significantly lower with filtration, without significant difference in image quality. The patient cohort groups with added filtration (protocols 3 and 4) showed significant reduction of total AK and DAP/patient without compromise to the image quality. Variations in focal spot size showed no significant differences in radiation dose and image quality.
3::We included 195 patients. The median age was 62.9 years; the performance status was 0-1 in 80 and 2-3 in 92 patients. The median number of metastatic sites was one. A total of 73 patients (37.4%) were alive 12 months after beginning chemotherapy. In multivariate analysis, no liver metastasis, CA19-9 level <250 IU/ml and localized or locally advanced cancer at diagnosis were good prognostic factors. According to a clinical score based on these features, overall survival was 7.7, 13.5, 19.7 and 21.0 months, respectively (p<0.001).
3::The proportion of Bangladeshis scoring low on the knowledge assessment was 0.53, where as the proportion of whites scoring low in the CARDIA study was 0.32 (p value < .001). Whites were 34% more likely to score high than Bangladeshis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-1.52). Bangladeshis were more likely to mention diet and cholesterol as risk factors and less likely to mention lack of exercise, being overweight, and smoking as risk factors.
3::Two hundred patients were enrolled in the study. Seventy five percent of patients were known to have rheumatic heart disease, while 16.5% had infective endocarditis. The mitral valve was replaced in 40% of patients, the aortic valve was replaced in 36%, and other patients had both valves replaced. Early postoperative period PVL was detected in 25 patients. The most common underlying etiologies were rheumatic heart disease and infective endocarditis. PVL was common in patients with both valves replaced compared with either mitral or aortic valve replacement. Infective endocarditis as underlying valve disease was significantly high in patients with PVL compared with those without (p < 0.001).
3::Moderate-to-severe PTH was reported by 21.9% of patients (29.8% in mTIH group and 14.0% in non-mTIH group B, p = 0.012) at the 12-month follow-up. The mean NRS was higher in mTIH group than in non-mTIH group throughout the follow-up period (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11 to 1.14; p < 0.05, ANCOVA). Logistic regression analysis showed that post-traumatic seizure (odds ratio, 1.520; 95% CI, 1.128-6.785; p = 0.047) and mTIH (odds ratio, 2.194; 95% CI, 1.285-8.475; p = 0.039) were independently associated with moderate-to-severe PTH at the 12-month follow-up.
3::On univariate analysis, female gender (p=0.007), <40 pack years (p=0.029), not smoking during irradiation (p=0.037), TURBT (p=0.007) and KPS >70 (p<0.001) led to improved survival; EQD2 >55 Gy showed a trend (p=0.065) for such association. On Cox regression, gender [risk ratio (RR)=2.81; p=0.039], TURBT (RR=4.44; p=0.033) and KPS (RR=3.45; p=0.018) remained significant.
3::Patients with DM showed significantly elevated muscle tissue IL-4 and IFN-γ levels, whereas IL-17 levels were comparable between patients with DM and controls. Immunoblotting studies confirmed ELISA results. In DM muscle specimens, IL-4 and IFN-γ levels were positively correlated, while no correlation was observed between IL-17 and the other two cytokines. Moreover, IL-4 and IFN-γ levels were significantly negative correlated with muscle strength grades for the deltoid muscle.
3::There was no significant difference between Strategies A and B in percentages of patients achieving the primary endpoint (64.5% vs 54.9%; P=0.190). Mean incidences (A vs B) of total (10.2% vs 53.8%), documented symptomatic (5.1% vs 36.6%), and asymptomatic (8.2% vs 32.3%) hypoglycaemia were lower for Strategy-A (P<0.001 each). Proportions of patients achieving/maintaining HbA1c target (A, 63.3% vs B, 55.9%) were similar.
3::Thirty-one percent of patients (n = 10,910) at safety net hospitals underwent immediate reconstruction compared with 46 percent of patients (n = 14,619) at non-safety net hospitals (p < 0.001). Logistic regression revealed that women at non-safety net hospitals were significantly more likely to undergo reconstruction (OR, 1.89; 95 percent CI, 1.65 to 2.16). However, analysis by study year revealed that rates of reconstruction at safety net hospitals increased over time.
3::The distributions of MMP-8 C-799T, Val436Ala and Lys460Thr genotypes were not different between the oral cancer and non-cancer control groups. We also analyzed the allelic frequency distributions and no significant difference was found. As for gene-environment interaction analysis, there was an increased risk for smokers, alcohol drinkers or betel quid chewers with variant MMP-8 C-799T or Val436Ala genotypes.
3::In our case, despite the presence of clinical signs similar to a surgical site infection, the wound healing was most likely interrupted and delayed secondary to the electric field generated due to the frequent recharges of the pulse generator.
3::RNA-seq revealed that there were 1,736 (FDR<0.001) differentially expressed genes in the VC(-) and VC(+) groups. From the functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes in the VC(-) and VC(+) groups, predicted functionalities including cell death and cytotoxicity increased in the VC(+) group. Furthermore, it was predicted that the difference in hair growth between the VC(-) and VC(+) groups was caused by the expression of genes including keratin-related genes and the Sonic hedgehog gene. It was confirmed that hair growth was significantly promoted; hair growth from hair papilla cells was also confirmed by HE staining of the shaved backs of SMP-30/GNL-KO mice in the VC(+) group.
3::The child demonstrated gains in throwing accuracy, significant gains on measures of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency-2, the Test of Gross Motor Development-2, and the School Function Assessment.
3::The sample included 20 959 children. Children with at least 2 CCCs had higher odds of PT/OT than children with no CCC. Children with DD had 12-fold higher odds of having any PT/OT compared with children with diagnosis. Children with a DD and 2 CCCs had the highest PT/OT spending.
3::There were 253 deaths during a mean follow-up of 5.7 years. Increased SFA was associated with decreased all-cause mortality, whereas an increased VFA and VSR were related to increased all-cause mortality. Compared with the predictive power of body mass index (BMI), SFA and VSR showed a larger area under the curve than did BMI. In Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, increased SFA and VSR were associated with decreased and increased hazard of all-cause death, respectively. However, in multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, only VSR was independently associated with all-cause mortality. Moreover, this relationship was paralleled by the harmful impact of increased VSR on metabolic profiles.
3::The mean peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities of the hepatic artery and the peak flow velocity of the portal and hepatic veins were increased after intravenously administration of the USCA, ranging from 10% to 13%. However, the changes were not statistically significant (P=0.097, 0.103, 0.128, and 0.190, respectively). There were no significant differences in other measured parameters, including the resistive index (P=0.205) and systolic acceleration time (P=0.489) of the hepatic artery and venous pulsatility index (P=0.494) of the hepatic vein.
3::On multivariate analysis, Malay adolescents were more likely to report marginally unfavorable attitude towards condom use (aPR 1.21 CI 1.00-1.48) and significantly lower confidence in using condoms correctly (aPR 1.24 CI 1.05-1.47) than Chinese adolescents. They were also more likely to report significantly younger first sex age (aPR 0.98 CI 0.96-1.00), never use of condoms for vaginal sex (aPR 1.32 CI 1.16-1.49) and anal sex (aPR 1.75 CI 1.11-2.76) and non-use of contraceptives at last sex (aPR 1.30 CI 1.17-1.45) than Chinese respondents. Malay males were less likely to buy sex (aPR 0.56 CI 0.37-0.85), but they reported higher likelihood of inconsistent condom use with female sex workers (aPR 2.24 CI 1.30-3.87).
3::A total of 205 patients were included and 15 (7.3%) patients were identified as having EBV-positive gastric cancer. Age, gender, tumor location, and histological type showed no significant differences between EBV-positive and negative groups. EBV-positive cancer is significantly more frequent in the higher-metabolic-tumor group than in the lower one (p=0.032). The mean SUVmax of gastric cancers showed significant differences between EBV-positive and negative groups (9.9±4.2 vs. 7.0±4.8, p=0.026).
3::When corrected for similar DE intake, dTT was significantly higher in DD compared to CD (p < 0.001). There was a significant negative correlation between creatinine clearance and dTT (r = -0.91, p < 0.01) among DD. Additionally, dTT positively correlated with CHOL (r = 0.96, p < 0.01), LDL (r = 0.75, p = 0.04), and GLU (r = 0.83, p = 0.02). In multiple regression analysis, creatinine clearance (r = -0.81, p = 0.01), CHOL (r = 0.93, p < 0.001), and LDL (r = 0.74, p < 0.01) remained the only independent predictors of dTT.
3::EGFR expression at any level was detected in 40/50 (80%) cores. Over-expression was observed in 23/40 (57.5%) cases. Gene amplification was identified in 11/50 (22%) cases whereas chromosome 7 polysomy in 8/50 (16%) cases. Pure chromosome 7 multiplication alone led to low or moderate levels of expression. Overall EGFR expression was correlated with gene (p=0.001) and interestingly with chromosome 7 centromere numerical imbalances (p=0.004).
3::Aspects of hockey culture such as an overemphasis on winning games and upheld misperceptions about the risks associated with concussion were identified as relevant to the underreporting of concussions. Various factors relevant to the underreporting of concussions include players motivation to win, group membership dynamics such as a player's role as the team's ""enforcer,"" coaches' own motivation to win to further their own opportunities in the sport, and parents' personal financial interest or alternative agenda in terms of time commitments and their child's future career prospects.'
3::The values of attenuation parameters and volume on inspiratory and expiratory quantitative computed tomography (QCT) were significantly different between males and females (p < 0.001). The MLA and the 15th percentile value on inspiratory QCT were significantly lower in the ever-smoker group than in the never-smoker group (p < 0.05). On expiratory QCT, all lung attenuation parameters were significantly different according to the age range (p < 0.05). Pi10 in ever-smokers was significantly correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity (r = -0.455, p = 0.003). In simple and multivariate regression analyses, TLCCT, FRCCT, and age showed significant associations with lung attenuation (p < 0.05), and only TLCCT was significantly associated with inspiratory Pi10.
3::The acupressure group reported 11 mm less pain (95% CI: 5-17) on average than the sham acupressure group, and 9 mm less (95% CI: 3-16) than the control group as a result of the intervention (P < 0.05). There was no difference between groups in: anxiety levels, or in any of the secondary outcome measures.
3::From 2005 to 2014, there were 13,583 live births during approximately 78,000 person years of follow-up of women aged 15-49 years. The total fertility rate in HIV-negative women decreased from 6.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.5 to 6.8] in 2005-2006 to 5.1 (4.8-5.5) in 2011-2014. In HIV-positive women, the total fertility rate was more stable, although lower, at 4.4 (3.2-6.1) in 2011-2014. In 2011-2014, compared with HIV-negative women, the adjusted (age, marital status, and education) hazard ratio was 0.7 (95% CI: 0.6 to 0.9) and 0.8 (95% CI: 0.6 to 1.0) for women on ART for at least 9 months and not (yet) on ART, respectively. The crude fertility rate increased with duration on ART up to 3 years before declining. The proportion of HIV-exposed infants decreased, but the proportion of ART-exposed infants increased from 2.4% in 2007-2010 to 3.5% in 2011-2014.
4::The results of this study demonstrated a relationship in performance of different single leg hop tests in professional decathletes. Adversely there is no correlation of the single leg hop tests and the performance in the star excursion balance test. To minimize the time effort of testing procedures, to avoid redundant testing and to determine overall postural control in decathletes, test-batteries should include the SEBT and at least one SLHT.
4::REEc1 can be considered the best accurate model of REE estimation in Brazilian young men, providing the REE and metabolically active tissue-organ of four components. Caution should be exercised with the use of DXA metabolic maps in populations with greater weight and greater weight-height.
4::The OMT classification can be used to describe hand anomalies that may present in over 1,400 diseases. CulaPhen was developed to provide a (hand) phenotype-based differential diagnosis. Differential diagnosis formulation based on the proposed system outperforms the system in current use.
4::Multimatrix mesalazine 4.8 g/day has higher efficacy and shows no difference in safety in mildly to moderately active UC, in comparison with pH-dependent-release mesalazine 3.6 g/day.
4::These findings show progress in ARV treatment, although ARV coverage remains low compared with other populations at risk for HIV. Efforts to improve ARV coverage among PWIDs are needed.
4::Individuals with CD exhibited higher serum levels of LPS varying from a 2- to 6-fold increase depending on disease activity, when compared with healthy controls. CD26 levels were lower in the CD groups. Both LPS and CD26 correlated with disease severity and serve as potential CD biomarkers.
4::IBD significantly impacts daily life, including work, education, and social relationships. Treatment that addresses the full spectrum of life of a patient would be more effective.
4::Although search filters can facilitate the identification of research evidence to enable decision making, variability in study abstracting and indexing can limit the generalizability and usability of these filters. This potential for variability should be considered when deciding to incorporate a search filter into any literature search. This research highlights the importance of this awareness when developing strategies for searching the published literature and the potential value of supplementing database searching with other methods of study identification.
4::ω-3 PUFAs may have a therapeutic role in decreasing pain associated with RA, with doses of 3 to 6 g/d appearing to have a greater effect. Due to the limitations identified in the RCTs included in this review, more research is needed to investigate ω-3 PUFAs in larger populations and over extended periods of time.
4::The phenotype of SPS in Korean patients is different from that of Western patients. In Korean patients, SPS is more common in men, there were fewer total numbers of serrated adenoma/polyps, and the incidence of CRC was lower than that in Western patients. Korean patients tend to more frequently have abnormal gastric lesions. However, the prevalence of synchronous adenomatous polyps is high in both Western and Korean patients.
4::This cross-sectional study demonstrates a broad heterogeneity of care giving between the clinical national and international guidelines and the actual practice in Spain. Although most of the responders refer to base their endometrial cancer management on Spanish and European Society of Gynaecologic Oncology guidelines (64.1%), many discrepancies have been observed, mainly in the management of intermediate-risk cases and follow-up. It may be caused by the lack of consensus on certain points, lack of facilities in lower case load centers, and also due to disagreement or unawareness on the current knowledge.
4::These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which MBP directly acts on ghrelin secretion. Additionally, the elevated ghrelin level induced by MBP may act as a mediator for bone formation.
4::Most reviews had significant deficiencies in reporting the search process that raise questions about how these searches were conducted and ultimately cast serious doubts on the validity and reliability of reviews based on a potentially biased and incomplete body of literature. These deficiencies also highlight the need for veterinary journal editors and publishers to be more rigorous in requiring adherence to PRISMA guidelines and to encourage veterinary researchers to include librarians or information specialists on systematic review teams to improve the quality and reporting of searches.
4::The use of PET/MR is clinically feasible in pediatric patients with a histiocytic disease. PET/MR demonstrates comparable image quality and lesion detection to PET/CT while maintaining strongly correlated quantitative performance. Given the significant radiation dose savings, PET/MR represents an appealing alternative to PET/CT in the care of children with histiocytic disorders.
4::Low-volume disease was present in one third of patients with nodal metastases, the largest metastatic deposit only in patients who had SLN dissection; these patients were significantly more likely to have grade 1 endometrioid carcinoma with less than 50% myometrial invasion, traditional ""low-risk"" features.
4::Compatibility is a key characteristic of multi-herb prescriptions. It often results in the change of the therapeutic material basis and, thus, produces the effect of reducing toxicity and/or increasing curative efficacy.
4::Infant regulatory difficulties are associated with a higher risk of obesity at preschool age. Helping parents manage and respond to difficult infant behaviors before preschool may serve as a focal point for future interventions.
4::The probability of occurrence of IBD in family members of affected North Indian UC patients is lower than that reported in Western populations.
4::This trend analysis suggests declining HIV prevalence among NYC PWID. However, HCV seroprevalence was high and risk behaviors were considerable. Longitudinal surveillance of HIV and HCV risk behaviors and infections is needed to monitor trends and for ongoing data-informed prevention among PWID.
4::The Systematic Review Competencies Framework provides a standards-based, flexible way for librarians and organizations to identify areas of competence and areas in need of development to build capacity for systematic review integration. The framework can be used to identify or develop appropriate assessment tools and to target skill development opportunities.
4::Our experience confirms the feasibility and safety of LESS in a variety of benign adnexal pathology. Both the SIMP and HMGP approaches seem comparable. Performing LESS without the use of specialised access ports or instruments makes it cost effective and suitable for wider application.
4::The results of the present study suggested that SSB intake is associated with obesity and that coffee/tea, water, and milk may be good alternatives for SSB. Further longitudinal and intervention studies are warranted to examine the effects of beverage substitution on obesity.
4::Although syphilis screening among MSM increased during 2008-2014, less than half of MSM reported recent syphilis screening in 2014. Given continued increases in syphilis among MSM, innovative interventions are needed to improve compliance with screening recommendations.
4::Both IU to meet men and meeting the last partner online increased since 2008. Although men who used the internet more frequently reported more partners in the past 12 months, they were also more likely to report testing in the past 12 months and were more likely to be HIV-positive aware.
4::We have demonstrated that the endoscopic surgery is safe and effective for repairing CDH. The endoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure with fast post-operative recovery and a good cosmetic outcome.
4::Results indicate feasibility for larger, more definitive study. Both groups had significant reductions in alcohol consumption over time and high-treatment engagement rates. Both oral and injectable formulations are feasible to initiate prior to discharge for hospital inpatients identified as having an AUD.
4::Awareness of what is considered design quality in relation to healthcare architecture could help to design healthcare environments based on evidence. To operationalize the concept, its definition must be clear and explicit and able to meet the complex needs of the stakeholders in a healthcare context, including patients, staff, and significant others.
4::Diabetes is an important co-morbid feature to be sought in patients with TB. This study re-echo the need to raise awareness on screening for DM in persons with TB.
4::Iris plasmacytoma is rare and should prompt systemic evaluation to rule out multiple myeloma. Solitary iris plasmacytoma can be successfully treated with plaque radiotherapy.
4::Future strategies should focus on positively influencing social norms to support recommended practices, and emphasize the specific reasons behind the recommendations. Future efforts should take a multi-pronged approach using a variety of influences, not only directed at healthcare providers but close family members, including fathers.
4::Current antibiotic therapy for BU is highly successful in most patients but it may be possible to abbreviate treatment to 4 weeks in patients with a low initial bacterial load. On the other hand persistent infection contributes to slow healing in patients with a high bacterial load at baseline, some of whom may need antibiotic treatment extended beyond 8 weeks. Bacterial load was estimated from a single sample taken at baseline. A better estimate could be made by taking multiple samples or biopsies but this was not ethically acceptable.
4::Single-site laparoscopic colectomy with complete mesocolic excision for colon cancer provided acceptable perioperative outcomes and oncological outcomes, similar to those achieved with conventional multiport laparoscopic colectomy. Evidence accumulation from randomized controlled trials will be necessary to promote the wide acceptance of single-site laparoscopic colectomy. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A326.
4::Rectal cancer surgery with or without radiation is associated with a higher risk of urinary complications requiring procedures. Patients who undergo low anterior resection without radiation tend toward the lowest risk for a urinary adverse event.
4::Bowel function deteriorates frequently after low anterior resection for rectal cancer. Severe bowel dysfunction is significantly associated with preoperative long-course radiotherapy and a lower-third tumor, and the thickening of rectal wall after radiation is a strong predictor. Treatment decisions and patient consent should be implemented with raising awareness of bowel symptom burdens. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A317.
4::Emergent status and operative procedure are the 2 highest risk factors for postoperative venous thromboembolism. Extended venous thromboembolism prophylaxis might be appropriate for patients undergoing these high-risk procedures or any emergent colorectal procedures. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A339.
4::Coffee consumption was associated with some positive effects on the respiratory system. There was however limited available evidence, mostly from cross sectional and retrospective studies. The only prospective cohort studies were those reporting on respiratory mortality. These results suggest that coffee consumption may be a part of a healthy lifestyle leading to reduced respiratory morbidity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
4::Similar proportions of older, vulnerable aged ≥65 years patients with type 2 diabetes achieved/maintained glycaemic treatment goals without clinically significant hypoglycaemia with Strategies A or B. However, Strategy-A resulted in lower risk of total, documented symptomatic, and asymptomatic hypoglycaemia. These results identify an approach of potential clinical benefit in this age group and will inform future clinical research in older patients with type 2 diabetes. This trial is registered with ClinTrials.gov, number NCT02072096.
4::Increased VSR was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. This suggests that the location of fat deposits may be more important than the actual amount of body fat.
4::The 10-item ENLIST ENL Severity Scale is the first valid, reliable and responsive measure of ENL severity and improves our ability to assess and compare patients and their treatments in this severe and difficult to manage complication of leprosy. The ENLIST ENL Severity Scale will assist physicians in the monitoring and treatment of patients with ENL. The ENLIST ENL Severity Scale is easy to apply and will be useful as an outcome measure in treatment studies and enable the standardisation of other clinical and laboratory ENL research.
4::It is possible that EF can also negatively impact healing of a wound, and thus should be a consideration to clinicians when a delay in proper wound healing is encountered postoperatively. Therefore, in the postoperative period, when the wound healing is most active, we recommend avoiding programs that require frequent pulse generator recharges.
4::In the human ureter, TRPA1 is located to sensory nerves and interstitial cells. TRPA1 agonists inhibited electrically induced contractions but had no direct effect on smooth muscle tension of the human ureter. A role for TRPA1 in modulating neurotransmission and possibly peristalsis of the human ureter is proposed.
4::CHB with spontaneous SAE responded similarly to treatment using either LVD or ETV, with both drugs inducing a rapid decline of HBV viral load.
4::The sequences provided important information about M. avium heterogenicity and evolution as a pathogen. The limitation is the lack of understanding on possible overlapping functions of genes/proteins.
4::Our review of 624 patients is the largest study in this subject and the results demonstrate that wearing a cervical collar following PRM for BPPV concedes no significant benefit. Excluding this from postprocedure guidance allows patients to manage without the inconvenience of wearing a cervical collar, and allows departments to update clinical guidance.
4::This study reveals a high burden of periodontitis among adults living in circumpolar communities in Norway. The results showed sociodemographic disparities regarding periodontitis, and highlights the importance of further investigation of factors influencing periodontal health.
4::Results from this study suggest that both treatments are effective, however, adjunct use of clarithromycin to FMUD leads to better reduction of deep pockets and P. gingivalis at 6 months compared to FMUD alone ( Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02829983).
4::Our results show equal fluctuation of LEV serum concentrations with branded LEV and the generic LEV. Most importantly, within-subject variability was much larger than the small, non-significant differences between brands.
4::Routine childhood vaccination is an important public health tool to reduce infectious diseases. The present study provides important epidemiological evidence significantly associating increasing Hg exposure from Thimerosal-containing childhood vaccines and the subsequent risk of atypical autism diagnosis, and suggests that Thimerosal should be eliminated from vaccines.
4::Independent of other risk factors, higher vegetable nitrate was associated with a lower CCA-IMT and a lower risk of an ischemic cerebrovascular disease event.
4::This sequence represents a good candidate for ultrafast acquisition of myocardial T1 maps. Magn Reson Med, 2017. © 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.
4::Most habitual toileting behaviors were not associated with urinary urgency except waiting too long to urinate when at work. Logistic regression revealed significant relationships among health-related factors, personal characteristics, behaviors, and urinary urgency. LUTS in women is both a womens health and occupational health issue.'
4::Nurse-led vascular care in hypertensive community-dwelling older persons did not diminish WMH accumulation over 3 years. However, our results do suggest this type of intervention could be effective in persons with high WMH volumes. There was no effect on lacunar infarcts incidence but numbers were low.
4::FE-DMEK shows efficacy similar to that of M-DMEK with apparently less graft detachment and reduced need for rebubbling.
4::In our early clinical experience with the absorbable polymer matrix scaffold P4HB, it seemed to provide superior clinical performance and value-based benefit compared with porcine cadaveric biologic mesh.
4::Designs of PAL with more negative horizontal mean power gradients are the most effective in lowering the lag of accommodation in myopes. This could make them good test candidates for myopia control applications.
4::Psychostimulants are insufficiently studied as adjunctive or monotherapy in adults with mood disorders. Most published studies have significant methodological limitations (eg, heterogeneous samples, dependent measures, type/dose of agent). In addition to improvements in methodological factors, a testable hypothesis is that psychostimulants may be more appropriately tested in select domains of psychopathology (eg, cognitive emotional processing), rather than as ""broad-spectrum"" antidepressants.
4::The present research suggests that lexical tone contour plays an important role in Mandarin sentence recognition, and misrepresented tone contours result in greater difficulty in sentence recognition in younger children. These results imply that maturation and/or language use experience play a role in the processing of tone contours for Mandarin speech understanding, particularly in noise.
4::Patients supported by the Pharm Booklet were twice as likely to choose to intensify therapy. The Pharm Booklets effects are partially mediated through persuasive communication techniques that influence patients' beliefs that symptoms will improve, and increase social normative beliefs, rather than by increasing the relevant knowledge, clarifying patient values about positive or negative treatment outcomes, or increasing their self-efficacy.'
4::(1) The prevalence of MKRN3 mutations in our cohort was similar to that reported in the literature in sporadic cases but lower than previously described in familial ones. This could be due to different inheritance patterns of families studied; (2) we expanded the phenotype of MKRN3 defects describing 3 more patients with MKRN3 mutations; and (3) point mutations in DLK1 and KCNK9 at least do not seem to be a common cause of CPP in girls.
4::The HRQoL and depression levels we found are alarming. They show the importance of evaluating objective and subjective indicators; in addition, we emphasize the need of assisting the severe cases detected and suggest the activities to face these health issues.
4::Our pilot study was unable to detect a beneficial effect of early administration of inhaled steroids on the clinical course of TTN in late preterm and term infants.
4::The presence of OSA and sleep fragmentation may induce changes in branched-chain amino acid metabolism in snoring children, independently of obesity. These data may suggest a new mechanism linking OSA and glucose homeostasis.
4::The presence of ANCA-associated vasculitides is rare in the eastern Metropolitan area of Mexico City. GPW was predominant over CCS, and MPA was absent. They are multi-system vasculitides with high scores of initial activity and moderate damage.
4::The presented technique holds promise of being a relatively easy to perform, predictable and well-controlled alternative for achieving a type 1 bubble during DALK surgery. The trypan-blue-stained viscoelastic device facilitates proper visualization and control of the separation bubble and assists in identifying the penetrance to the separation bubble prior to removal of the stromal cap.
4::As an alternative to repeat PK, EK after failed PK allows for potential reduction of the risk of graft rejection; however, it does not appear to confer a significant advantage in graft survival or visual acuity.
4::In a busy pediatric pulmonary clinic, while we successfully lengthened time between albuterol administration and post-bronchodilator testing in the vast majority of patients, no difference was seen in the percentage of patients classified as bronchodilator responsive. Results from this study appear to question the ATS/ERS recommended 15 min post-bronchodilator administration wait time for children.
4::Combined with the gestational weeks data, the birth weight SD score may be useful to estimate the prognosis of HF patients with pleural effusion. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
4::In this small retrospective study of adult patients treated for acute HIT, treatment with DOAC therapy was not associated with in-hospital thrombotic or hemorrhagic events.
4::Lag screws fixation of posterior wall through single ilioinguinal approach in associated both column fractures of acetabulum is a safe and effective method. Our results shown that the presence of posterior wall fracture in cases of associated both column fractures does not compromise the clinical outcomes.
4::Although there are relationships between drug use and criminal behavior, these behaviors alone are insufficient explanations for one another in an adult reentry population. Alternatively, the compounding social and personal needs of the reentry population, and the extent to which they received support or services to address these needs, appear to have the strongest influence on both behaviors in the reentry context.
4::Q fever PCR from formalin-fixed liver tissues appears to be a useful adjunct for diagnosing Q fever hepatitis.
4::These findings suggest that pushing technique influences stroller running speed and kinematics. These findings suggest specific fitness effects may be achieved through the implementation of different pushing methods.
4::JETB showed high community engagement while offering opportunities for increased outdoor play in children. The intervention showed a significant effect on the number of children meeting the daily pedometer-derived physical activity recommendations.
4::The most common cause of hirsutism is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In some cases, hirsutism is mild and requires only reassurance and local (nonsystemic) therapy, while in others it causes significant psychological distress and requires more extensive therapy. In case of rapid progressive hair growth should be first exclude androgen-secerning tumour (ovarian, adrenal) as the most serious condition.
4::The present study confirmed that both T and DHT accumulated in the stroma of enlarged prostates; the degree of accumulation correlated with prostate volume.
4::While a large number of hospitalisations and deaths due to pneumococcal disease still occur among children 0-59 months in South Africa, we found a large reduction in this estimate that is temporally associated with PCV introduction. In HIV-infected individuals the scale-up of other interventions, such as improvements in HIV care, may have also contributed to the declines in pneumococcal burden.
4::ORAC assessment revealed a robust effect of RFR, however the other experiments revealed equivocal effects. Further studies examining the combination of ORAC with NMDA are warranted to elucidate more clearly the effect of RFR on the brain.
4::Addressing HIV in cities with high levels of MSMW may have the dual effect of improving the health of MSM populations that have a high burden of HIV and to improve the health of their larger communities.
4::The present results are consistent with the view that temperament plays a causal role in the development of symptoms of psychiatric disorders in children. Because temperament is malleable, interventions targeting the affective, attentional, and behavioral regulatory components of temperament may reduce psychopathology in children.
4::In this Canadian cohort of patients with cryptogenic IS or TIA, the prevalence of Fabry was 0.3% if p.R118C variant is considered as pathogenic. This suggests that more cost-effective methods should be applied for diagnosis of Fabry rather than systematic genetic screening in this population. Overall, cryptogenic IS in young adults is associated with favorable outcomes.
4::Almost all pancreatic cancers can be diagnosed by EUS-FNA. Furthermore, other clinical characteristics of pancreatic cancer undiagnosed by EUS-FNA were different from autoimmune pancreatitis undiagnosed by EUS-FNA. Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided FNA can be used to rule out malignancy in autoimmune pancreatitis patients.
4::Findings may assist mental health professionals in enhancing health-promoting behaviors and reduce the psychological distress of community residents to improve well-being.
4::This study demonstrates an acceptable occurrence of MI, death, repeat intervention, and stent thrombosis in a high-risk group of V. Eld. patients with de novo lesions. Age alone in the absence of other non-cardiac factors should not prohibit a patient from access to PCI.
4::Evidence shows that the PCMH model can increase health outcomes among low-income populations. However, limitations to quality include no assessment for confounding variables. Implications are discussed.
4::Our findings suggest that long-term maintenance of PA increases resulting from group meetings in an active intervention occur when followed by a maintenance intervention.
4::Early detection and treatment of breast cancer might be effective for decreasing the economic burden, because costs escalate as the degree of malignancy increases.
4::This survey indicates that the majority of Nordic anaesthesia departments who manage anaesthesia for EVT are able to provide immediate 24-h response to an EVT request. Most of these departments have institutional guidelines for EVT anaesthesia and haemodynamic management. Conscious sedation appears to be the preferred method of anaesthetic care.
4::Persons experiencing epilepsy should be educated on the proper use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs); moreover, their preferences should be considered when types of therapy are prescribed. Patients who deviate from recommended use of medication should report these practices to medical personnel so that potential changes in health status can be addressed properly.
4::Sporotrichosis is the most common subcutaneous mycosis in Peru, with a high disease burden in Apurimac. Chromoblastomycosis, lobomycosis, and subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis are rare mycoses in Peru.
4::The expenditure on opioids is a significant cost to Brazilian patients, especially given that the Brazilian Public Health System should dispense these drugs free of charge. Codeine was the most prescribed opioid.
4::Our findings add valuable insights into the patterns of sedentary behaviors among older adults. Concentrated research efforts should be made to gain a clearer understanding of patterns and enablers to sedentary behaviors, which will allow for development of targeted interventions for this high-risk population.
4::These data suggest that abstinence environment influences the enduring effects of cocaine among adolescents as well as adults.
4::In this study, tooth condition and the use of anchorage devices are currently the main considerations by both orthodontists and laypersons when selecting the teeth to be extracted for orthodontic treatment.
4::27-G vitrectomy requires longer operative time than 25-G, but using the 27-G system results in earlier visual improvement and stabilized ocular pressure.
4::The use of adjuvant CRT is increasing among elderly patients with resected squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck exhibiting ECE or positive margins. Chemoradiotherapy was associated with an improvement in OS on multivariable analysis but not propensity-weighted analysis. Among fit elderly patients with ECE or positive margins after definitive surgical resection, concurrent chemotherapy can be carefully considered.
4:: Simultaneous ESD for multiple synchronous colorectal lesions is safe and feasible compared with single ESD and can reduce the burden to patients, length of hospital stay and medical expense. These results need to be elucidated by further studies.
4::The studied elderly population showed evidence of similar long-term clinical efficacy after definitive CCRT when compared with cohorts of younger patients with similar prognostic status. An increased rate of pulmonary toxicity was identified, without evidence of differences for nonpulmonary severe adverse events. Understanding the prognostic risk factors of pulmonary toxicity after CCRT may effectuate improved long-term outcomes for elderly population.
4:: pCLE is useful for in vivo analysis of abnormalities of the capillary and lymphatic vessels and epithelium, and for diagnosis in various small-bowel diseases.
4::Pyramidal displacement of maxilla was evident. Apex of pyramid faced the nasal bone and base was located on the oral side. Posterosuperior part of nasal cavity moved minimally in lateral direction and width of nasal cavity at the floor of the nose increased, there was downward and forward movement of maxilla with a tendency toward posterior rotation. Maximum von Mises stresses were found along midpalatal, pterygomaxillary, nasomaxillary and frontomaxillary sutures.
4::This study found that the craniofacial patterns of Korean children with snoring and ATH could be categorized into three characteristic clusters according to age groups. Although no significantly dominant sagittal skeletal discrepancy was observed, hyperdivergent vertical discrepancy was consistently evident in all clusters.
4::After differentiation from iPSCs, tracheal epithelial tissues survived in rat bodies, warranting the use of iPSCs for epithelial regeneration in tracheal defects.
4::Zirconia micro-implants showed initial stability and clinical applicability for diverse orthodontic treatments comparable to that of titanium micro-implants under compressive and tensile forces.
4::ATs more commonly reported injuries that are easily diagnosed and treated (e.g., sprains/strains); EDs more commonly reported injuries with longer recovery times and rehabilitation (e.g., fractures). Although ED surveillance data can identify the most severe sports-related injuries, high school and college sports surveillance may better describe the breadth of sports-related injuries. Our findings may provide further support for school-based sports medicine professionals, but further research is needed to comprehensively examine the potential economic and health-related benefits.
4::Our study suggests that among patients with ICH, previous use of CAPT, but not SAPT, was associated with higher risk for in-hospital mortality.
4::Seniors without previously known stage B or stage C heart failure have moderate-to-severe DD, 27% of whom were stage C. Identifying seniors with DD leads to improvement in care.
4::This study demonstrated that quantitative analysis of the echo intensity of US images can provide important information. However, further research is necessary to explore the relationships among sex, age, blob area, count, body mass index, regional anatomy, and extent of training or exercise of the particular muscle.
4::In patients who underwent transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, OSA was associated with higher rates of certain pulmonary and airway complications. OSA was not associated with increased non-pulmonary/airway complications or inpatient mortality, despite older average age and higher comorbidity rates.
4::The present results suggest that oleandrin induces apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells via the mitochondrial pathway. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanism of anti-cancer property of oleandrin.
4::It is possible to intervene in classroom settings to improve the language comprehension skills of children with language difficulties. However, it appears that such interventions need to be intensive and prolonged.
4::This regimen was feasible and highly active resulting in encouraging survival in patients with LAPC. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the effectiveness of this treatment strategy in future studies. Clinical trials information: UMIN000006332.
4::The centinel program is effective in reporting dysphonia although it is important to highlight the low declaration as occupational disease of the cases detected.
4::In acute asthma exacerbations, the present study showed that additional administration of oral montelukast resulted in significantly higher FEV1at 4 weeks and PEFR at 2 weeks and 4 weeks as compared to the standard treatment alone. These findings should be confirmed by conducting a larger population-based clinical study.
4::Chemotherapy for NSCLC improves symptoms, nutritional status, and exercise capacity but worsens the antioxidant status.
4::This represents the longest prospective trial of a medical therapy for Cushings disease to date. A subset of patients treated with pasireotide maintained biochemical and clinical improvements for 5 years, with no new safety signals emerging. These data support the use of pasireotide as an effective long-term therapy for some patients with Cushing's disease.'
4::In this prospective observational study, we found no differences in the incidence of pneumonia and/or ARDS between patients undergoing lung resection with tidal volumes <8 or ≥8 mL/kg. Our data suggest that when fluid restriction and peak airway pressures are limited, the clinical impact of PLV in this patient population is small. Future randomized trials are needed to better understand the benefits of a small tidal volume strategy during OLV on clinically important outcomes.
4::This study demonstrated that similar to subjects with DM, subjects with IFG also have IOP levels that are higher than those with normal serum glucose. Moreover, there is a direct correlation between fasting serum glucose levels and changes in IOP. These findings highlight another end-organ effect of uncontrolled glucose levels.
4::This result was unexpected and suggests that further research needs to be conducted with a more robust sample size to account for any moderating influences that might explain why a hopeful message that communicates togetherness would have a negative attitudinal impact on male viewers.
4::Besides being the first study to evaluate adrenomedullin levels to elucidate the etiology of childhood ADHD as well as NO, significant differences was not found between the case and the control groups in terms of NO and adrenomedullin levels.
4::Scanning of pregnant women for both depression and childhood trauma will give change to health providers to support this vulnerable group and their prospective children.
4::We found that intervention was more common in the later time period, with good results concerning safety, and less readmissions. A majority of the conservatively treated patients had surgical intervention within two years after delivery. Our results support surgical intervention in pregnancy.
4::Honokiol can attenuate CL diet induced NASH and the mechanism in which possibly is polarizing macrophages to M2 phenotype via PPARγ activation.
4::Our findings are highly supportive of the practice of analyzing the impact of clinical decision support on performance metrics. This was the most common user-centered design practice in our study, and was the practice associated with higher perceived utility of clinical decision support. This practice may be particularly helpful at community-based clinics, which are typically less connected to VA medical center resources.
4::Familiarity with and use of data sharing projects was high among GPs and PMs. Both their individual and organisational characteristics were associated with the reported frequency of discussions and patients responses. Improved awareness of the impact of provider characteristics and attitudes on patients' decisions about data sharing may enhance the equity and autonomy of those decisions.'
4::Classification tree analysis survival models offer many advantages over Cox regression, such as explicit maximization of predictive accuracy, parsimony, statistical robustness, and transparency. Therefore, researchers interested in accurate prognoses and clear decision rules should consider developing models using the CTA-survival framework.
4::Our findings indicate that although the MDQ items cohere to define a total score, their structure is best modeled by meaningful Positive Activation and Negative Activation factors. Researchers and clinicians should be aware of these distinct sets of MDQ content, as high scorers on Positive Activation are less likely to identify past symptoms as problematic and show distinct clinical profiles from high scorers on Negative Activation.
4::The study adds to the understanding of what may exacerbate schizotypal symptoms in the first 12 months postpartum as parental attachment insecurity and parental stress together predicted elevated self-reported experiences of schizotypal symptoms.
4::Domestic DESs showed the same safety as imported DESs in this real-world cohort. But, patients implanted with domestic DESs had a higher risk of revascularization than imported DESs.
4::The use of the Dutch painDETECT and the DN4 in patients with suspected radiculopathy should not be recommended yet. A combination of both screening tools seems most suitable to rule out neuropathic pain in patients suspected of radiculopathy.
4::The VERIS HIV-1 Assay for use on the DxN VERIS System demonstrated comparable clinical performance to COBAS(®) HIV-1 Test, RealTime HIV-1 Assay, and VERSANT HIV-1 Assay.
4::This early warning tool can be used as an indicator for other communicable diseases in order to apply effective and timely public health measures especially in the setting of weak surveillance systems.
4::Results supported the conclusion that pain catastrophizing and sex moderate the relationship between pain intensity and opioid prescription. Although men and women patients had similar Pain Catastrophizing Scale scores, historically ""subthreshold"" levels of pain catastrophizing were significantly associated with opioid prescription only for women patients. These findings suggest that pain intensity and catastrophizing contribute to different patterns of opioid prescription for men and women patients, highlighting a potential need for examination and intervention in future studies.
4::Pre-operative simulation, changes in ports for insertion of the scope and robotic first arm, continuation of the coaxial operation, and use of a powered stapler made Delta applicable for RADG. Delta can be considered as a useful reconstruction method.
4::All MSC populations are not equivalent; care should be taken to select cells for clinical use that minimize potential safety problems and maximize chance of patient benefit. Adipose-derived MSCs seem more consistently procoagulant than BM-MSCs, presenting a potential safety concern for systemic administration in coagulopathic patients. Donor variation exists between different cell populations, and culture handling conditions may also determine coagulation activity. Cells must be routinely monitored during preparation to ensure that they retain the desired characteristics before patient administration.
4::Early gains in LE for NT Aboriginal people are consistent with improvements in nutrition, maternal and infant care, and infectious disease control. A rapid epidemiological transition followed, when LE gains in younger age groups plateaued and non-communicable diseases became more prevalent. Recent LE gains, across all adult age groups, are consistent with improved health service access and chronic disease management. If LE is to continue improving, socio-economic disadvantage and its associated risks must be reduced.
4::The results of the current study suggested that NNT-AS1 might play an important role in cervical carcinogenesis and might serve as a potentially therapeutic target and prognostic marker in the treatment of cervical cancer.
4::U.S. seniors Match outcomes may be affected by applicant characteristics that negatively influence their selection for interviews, and their difficulties may be exacerbated by disadvantageous ranking behaviors.'
4::The use of short wavelength-blocking glasses at night increased subjectively measured sleep quality and objectively measured melatonin levels and sleep duration, presumably as a result of decreased night-time stimulation of ipRGCs. Alterations in the ipRGC-driven pupil response suggest a shift in circadian phase. Results suggest that minimising short wavelength light following sunset may help in regulating sleep patterns.
4::Fourier decomposition of posterior Keratometric data provides parameters with high accuracy in differentiating SKC from normal corneas and should be included in the prompt diagnosis of KC.
4::The samples present good antioxidant/anti-glycation/cytotoxic activities and a plethora of biologically active compounds. These results suggest a potential role of propolis in targeting ageing and diseases associated with oxidative and carbonylic stress, aggregating value to them.
4::Most nurses working with patients with cancer are interested in the integration of CIM into supportive cancer care.  .
4::Based on these results, the specific emotions of shame and guilt contextualized to the body differentially predict BCS health motivations and behavior over time. .'
4::The findings suggest that gender had a minimal effect on physical health and no effect on physical activity levels in older caregivers. Depression and poor sleep quality were high in some caregivers but did not predict physical activity levels.  .
4::The V-V laxity in the isolated ACL-deficient knee was greater than that in the intact knee. The increased laxity was attenuated and approached that in the intact knee by adding posterior tibial load. Application of posterior tibial load is necessary for accurate assessment of V-V instability in the ACL-deficient knee. Clinically, the V-V laxity in the combined ACL-MCL or ACL-LCL injured knee may be overestimated without posterior tibial load.
4::Findings from this study may guide the timing of interventions that could improve school achievement among survivors.  .
4::This review highlights the inconsistencies in measuring or assessing hyperglycemia and the lack of standardized guidelines in treating hyperglycemia. Failure to have a standard approach to the measurement and management of hyperglycemia impedes the ability of healthcare providers to determine the significance of its impact on health outcomes. Further research is needed to establish appropriate measurement guidelines to address hyperglycemia in people with cancer. .
4::Almost half of the oncology nurses providing advice on nutrition and PA perceived themselves as having insufficient knowledge to be able to provide such advice. In particular, younger oncology nurses and oncology nurses with an intermediate vocational education may benefit most from education about these topics.  .
4::Computer-assisted navigation facilitated minimally invasive spine surgery-TLIF. CAMISS-TLIF was superior to open TLIF for treating 1-level degenerative lumbar disease, although it required longer operation time in the initial stage. CAMISS-TLIF showed several benefits compared with open TLIF, including less intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, and pain; earlier rehabilitation; and shorter postoperative hospitalization.
4::A thorough understanding of treatment modalities is helpful in evaluating and managing metacarpal fractures. Although the current literature supports a wide array of treatment strategies, high-level evidence to guide fracture management remains lacking.
4::Ephedrine treatment for hypotension during DIEP flap cases is associated with decreased intraoperative flap complication rates compared with controls who did not receive vasopressors, whereas phenylephrine has no significant association. The common clinical practice of complete abstinence from vasopressors out of concern for worsening DIEP flap outcomes is not supported by this study.
4::Our results and early experience suggests that the less-invasive retroperitoneal approach is safe and effective for anterior lumbar surgery. Compared with the conventional approach, significantly better postoperative rehabilitation and abdominal muscle preservation were seen with this novel approach.
4::One in four patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis carried a diagnosis of submucous cleft palate. The authors found that abnormal speech and language development occurs in one in 1.7 patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis, and that speech therapy for such abnormal development is warranted in one in 3.4 of them-a prevalence two to five times higher compared with the general pediatric population.
4::The Siremobil Iso-C 3D provides high-quality 3D scans in slender spine regions (eg, cervical spine), whereas the Vision FD Vario 3D appears to have advantages in the lumbar spine. Further evolution and novel devices are needed to optimize image quality and handling.
4::Lumbar retrolisthesis, together with thoracolumbar kyphosis, appears to be associated with mechanisms associated with regulation of sagittal balance. Low PI and disk instability due to degeneration may contribute to the development and progression of retrolisthesis.
4::Self-reported pain was reduced with MT and sham ultrasound treatment 24 hours after treatment, but inflammatory markers within venous circulation and quantitative sensory tests were unable to differentiate between study groups. Therefore, we were unable to characterize mechanisms underlying chronic LBP.
4::The authors newly developed oxygen-sensing paint-on bandage exhibits a comparable trend in oxygenation recordings in a rat model similar to conventional oxygenation assessment techniques. This technique could potentially prove to be a valuable tool in the routine clinical management of flaps following free tissue transfer. Incorporating oxygen-sensing capabilities into a simple wound dressing material has the added benefit of providing both wound protection and constant wound oxygenation assessment.'
4::The present study showed positive correlation between the volume of removed disc tissue and decrease in postoperative ISV and ISH. There were no statistically significant differences in ISV and ISH between the group with end-plate perforation and the control group 6 months after lumbar discectomy. Clinical outcome and disability were significantly improved in both groups 3 and 6 months after surgery.
4::Complications from patients seeking aesthetic procedures abroad will continues to increase. Patients should be encouraged to undergo cosmetic surgery in the United States to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction and because it is economically advantageous.
4::To date, this is the first study to report the costs of failed primary instrumented lumbar fusions using ICBG and subsequent secondary fusions using rhBMP-2 from a primary payer perspective. On the basis of this evidence, a policy of using rhBMP-2 in all patients undergoing a primary instrumented lumbar fusion cannot be recommended.
4::After accounting for sociodemographic factors, women undergoing mastectomies at safety net hospitals remain less likely to undergo immediate breast reconstruction. However, the differences in rates of reconstruction between safety net and non-safety net hospitals have narrowed over time. The availability of immediate reconstruction lessens the psychological trauma of mastectomy, and it is critical to continue redirecting federal efforts toward this valuable component of breast cancer care.
4::Smaller DCSA in the early postoperative period was associated with radicular pain after lumbar decompression surgery. The best cutoff value for postoperative radicular pain was 67.7 mm. Absence of a suction drain at the time of early postoperative MRI was related to smaller DCSA.
4::Seventy-four percent of patients after ADR met strict clinical success after 2-year follow-up. The clinical success versus failure rate did not change from their 3-month follow-up in 85 of the 91 patients (93%). Overall clinical success may be improved most by patient selection and implant type.
4::There were no differences in daily physical activity between THA patients undergoing different surgical approaches. The surgical approach may not be a limiting factor for daily physical activity early after surgery in a fast-track treatment course.
4::Medicaid PT/OT use and spending are higher for children with more CCCs and those with DD because children with DD receive more specialized PT/OT.
4::Automated pupillometry in neurocritical care is a valuable adjunct to traditional invasive monitoring. Integration of routine pupillometer assessments not only improves accuracy of examinations but also correlates with ICP values.
4::This is the first study that shows that psychodynamic therapy can be at least as efficacious as CBT for depression on important aspects of patient functioning other than depressive symptom reduction. These findings extend the evidence-base of psychodynamic therapy for depression, but replication is needed by means of rigorously designed noninferiority trials. (PsycINFO Database Record
4::Whole-liver CT-texture analysis has potential to predict patients at risk of developing early liver metastases ≤6 months, but is not robust enough to identify patients at risk of developing metastases at later stage.
4::Using local wound infiltration with LB, opioid use, LOS, and costs were improved after laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The additional medication cost was overshadowed by the overall cost benefits. Incorporating LB into a multimodal pain regiment had a benefit on patient outcomes and health care utilization.
4::The health workforce is a key component of any healthcare system and is critical in improving health care accessibility. Strategies to increase coverage of health workforce at PHCs are crucial to achieving adequate levels of health services for DM patients. Allocation of health workforce should focus on PHCs in rural and low-income areas.
4::Our data confirm that OMV-based vaccines elicit short-lasting SBA titres and may require repeated booster injections. However, strain coverage may be greater than expected.
4::The study shows that the intended benefits of gatekeeping were illusionary largely due to weak and worsening primary care conditions, and delay, ineffectiveness or unintended consequences of several other ongoing reforms. One particularly dangerous development of the system, which deserves urgent attention, is the harming of the professional prospects of primary care doctors. Our findings highlight the need for coordination and prioritization in designing policies related to primary care and managing changes with multiple on-going reforms. The approach used here facilitates comprehensive study of intended and actual mechanisms, and demonstrates the challenges of a complex health system intervention in a dynamic environment.
4::These data confirm that immune memory persists in a high percentage of children (>80%) at least 10years after a two-dose primary and booster vaccination schedule with a hexavalent vaccine (Hexavac or Infanrix hexa).
4::Age, education level, self-management efficacy and health literacy were all related to the HRQL of patient with hypertension, which means that patients who are more elderly and have lower education level, low self-management efficacy and poor health literacy get worse HRQL. This may imply the necessary to introduce routine assessment of health literacy and self-management efficacy into assessment procedures for hypertensive patients health management. Such assessment can help professionals to identify the population at greatest risk for poor health outcomes and low well-being in the future. In clinical practice, effective interventions such as direct guidance and education to raise the self-management efficacy and enhance health literacy might improve the HRQL of patients with hypertension.'
4::Biomarker profiles in patients with acute HFrEF were mainly related to cardiac stretch and in HFpEF related to inflammation. Patients with HFmrEF showed an intermediate biomarker profile with biomarker interactions between both cardiac stretch and inflammation markers. (PROTECT-1: A Study of the Selective A1 Adenosine Receptor Antagonist KW-3902 for Patients Hospitalized With Acute HF and Volume Overload to Assess Treatment Effect on Congestion and Renal Function; NCT00328692).
4::Parkinsons disease is associated with substantial physical and mental co-morbidity. Polypharmacy is also a significant issue due to the complex nature of the disease and associated treatments.'
4::Within the limitations of this longitudinal study, it can be suggested that IL-6 -572 G/C and IL-10 -592 C/A polymorphisms as well as their combination do not influence the outcome of nonsurgical periodontal therapy in Caucasian patients diagnosed with chronic periodontal disease.
4::N/L ratio may be used as a prognostic marker for patients with odontogenic infections. These patients may need a higher dose of antibiotics and stay more than 1 day in hospital for the treatment of odontogenic infection when the N/L ratio is detected to be more than 5.19.
4::The data did not demonstrate an impact of the 2007 guideline changes on overall incidence of pediatric IE. However, a significant increase in disease incidence trend due to VGS was observed for the 10-17 year-old group, compared pre- and post-guideline.
4::MitraClip was associated with a reduced rate of all-cause and HF hospitalizations and an increased rate of bleeding hospitalizations. One-year Medicare costs were reduced in those who survived a full year after the MitraClip procedure. Payors and providers seeking to reduce HF hospitalizations and associated Medicare costs may consider MitraClip among appropriate patients likely to survive 1 year.
4::A decline in pVO2 between consecutive CPETs predicts increased risk for death or transplant in adults with a Fontan circulation independent of baseline pVO2. These results support the additive clinical value of serial CPET in this population.
4::In the Trivandrum Heart Failure Registry, 1 of 3 HF patients died within 1 year of follow-up during their productive life years. Suboptimal adherence to guideline-directed treatment is associated with increased propensity of readmission and death. Quality improvement programs aiming to improve adherence to guideline-based therapy and reducing readmission may result in significant survival benefits in the relatively younger cohort of HF patients in India.
4::PARAGON-HF will determine whether sacubitril/valsartan is superior to angiotensin receptor blockade alone in patients with chronic symptomatic HFpEF. (Efficacy and Safety of LCZ696 Compared to Valsartan, on Morbidity and Mortality in Heart Failure Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction [PARAGON-HF]; NCT01920711).
4::The grading algorithm proposed by the 2016 LV diastolic dysfunction Recommendations detects elevated LVEDP and poor prognosis better than the 2009 Recommendations.
4::Expansive vessel wall remodeling was more frequent and intense with the BVS than the metallic DES and could be determined by patient baseline characteristics and periprocedural factors. The clinical effect of the observed lumen and vessel remodeling must be investigated in further large clinical studies to optimize the clinical outcome of patients and lesions treated by bioresorbable scaffolds. (ABSORB II Randomized Controlled Trial; NCT01425281).
4::Seasonal variation with winter predominance exists in AMI admissions and was significant in NSTEMI admissions but not in STEMI admissions. Seasonal variation was only significant in warmer southern states.
4::The FRANCE TAVI registry provided reassuring data regarding trends in TAVR performance in an all-comers population on a national scale. Nonetheless, given that TAVR indications are likely to expand to patients at lower surgical risk, concerns remain regarding potentially life-threatening complications and pacemaker implantation. (Registry of Aortic Valve Bioprostheses Established by Catheter [FRANCE TAVI]; NCT01777828).
4::The utilization of automated anesthesia carts reduced the drug recording errors in medication administrations of anesthesia.
4::There is high quality evidence that sevoflurane reduces death within 180 to 365days of surgery and, inotropic and vasoconstrictor support compared to propofol for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. There is also some evidence showing that the cardiac index is minimally influenced by administration of sevoflurane and desflurane compared to propofol.
4::This employer-based lifestyle intervention program was effective in reducing CVD risk factors after 1 year of treatment. Future studies should examine the effects of the intervention at 2 and 5 years to further assess long-term adoption of the lifestyle changes and maintenance of health promoted by this program.
4::The Pecs block reduces postsurgical opioid consumption during the PACU stay time for patients undergoing breast surgery.
4::This study shows that statin pretreatment may reduce the incidence of periprocedural complications dose dependently in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenting.
4::Glucocorticoid therapy may improve anterior pituitary function in a subset of patients but has no effect on restoring posterior pituitary function. Diabetes insipidus appears as a negative prognostic factor for response to glucocorticoids.
4::Findings indicate a low rate of initiating fall prevention behaviors following an ED visit for a fall-related injury among community-dwelling older adults, and highlight the ED visit as an important, but underutilized, opportunity to mobilize health care resources for people at high risk for subsequent falls.
4::A comprehensive understanding of the sleep patterns and quality of nurses with different work shifts may lead to better management of work shifts that reduces the influence of shift work on sleep quality.
4::Urrets-Zavalia syndrome is a possible complication of TSCPC, as well as of other 360-degree thermal laser procedures.
4::Thread carpal tunnel release is potentially a safe, quick, and effective procedure to transect the transverse carpal ligament. Future clinical investigation is recommended.
4::Hysteroscopy therapy could treat persistent CSP effectively and safely after curettage treatment failure. Therapy should be individualised, and the risks and cost of the hysteroscopy procedure and anaesthesia must be considered and fully discussed with the patients before surgery.
4::The findings of the present study suggest that an anatomic association exists between recalcitrant postoperative radiculopathy and NFB following an MIS-TLIF with BMP. Increased total bone growth as measured on serial axial and sagittal sections was associated with postoperative radiculopathy. The association between radiculopathy and the extension of BMP-induced bone growth toward the traversing nerve root appeared the most significant.
4::The results of this study demonstrated that plain radiographs alone can be used to classify and manage most pediatric fractures, confirming Silber previous findings. Furthermore, we recommend the specific instances of Schreck and Haasz et al in which CT scans should be used, sparing the general pediatric population unnecessary radiation. Such cases include patients with an abnormal abdominal or pelvic examination, complex fracture patterns, displacement greater than 1 cm, femur deformities, hematuria, Glasgow Coma Scale <13, hemodynamic instability, an aspartate aminotransferase > 200 U/L, an Hct < 30%, or an abnormal chest x-ray.
4::This study conclusively demonstrates that the plantar flexor muscles of the PAD patient at baseline and without pain are weaker in patients with PAD compared with controls. With the onset of claudication pain, patients with PAD exhibit altered muscle control strategies and further strength deficits are manifest compared to baseline levels. The myopathy of PAD legs appears to have a central role in the functional deterioration of the calf muscles, as it is evident both before and after onset of ischemic pain.
4::This study showed that symptoms of anxiety and depression in people with CRDs were significantly related to lower exercise tolerance levels and higher levels of disease impact. People with increased levels of anxiety and depression have the potential to significantly improve disease impact outcomes post-PR. The results demonstrated that the detection and treatment of anxiety and depression symptoms in people with CRDs are likely to be clinically important.
4::This meta-analysis demonstrates that the use of fibrin-thrombin sealant patches significantly reduces the total volume of lymph drained, the duration of the drainage, the incidence of lymphocele and symptomatic lymphocele, and the need for postoperative percutaneous drainage procedures. Its use does not affect the incidence of wound or lymphocele infections.
4::Aromatherapy is a viable intervention for improving insomnia and other symptoms commonly experienced by patients with acute leukemia.
4::From this survey, it is clear that relapse of disease has a negative psychological and physical impact, highlighting the importance of time without recurrence and the need for effective treatment in the long term.
4::In the United States, it is important to recognize variations in practice of syndactyly surgery in hopes of developing quality improvement strategies in pediatric orthopedic surgery.
4::miR-155 deficiency plays an effective role in attenuating liver IR injury likely by regulating the activation and inflammatory response, as well as modifying the polarization of KCs.
4::Wrist hemiarthroplasty in our series had a significant failure rate. In each case of failure, the patient developed ulnar-sided wrist pain. In the presence of more reliable procedures, wrist hemiarthroplasty is not indicated in its current incarnation.
4::HDTBR for 70 d induced peripapillary retinal thickening and cpRNFL thickening without visible signs of optic disc edema. The magnitude of such changes was not different between controls and exercisers. A slight IOP increase during BR subsided post-BR. Further study should evaluate whether different physical exercise paradigms may prevent/mitigate the risk of space-related visual impairment.Taibbi G, Cromwell RL, Zanello SB, Yarbough PO, Ploutz-Snyder RJ, Godley BF, Vizzeri G. Ophthalmological evaluation of integrated resistance and aerobic training during 70-day bed rest. Aerosp Med Hum Perform. 2017; 88(7):633-640.
4::Patients undergoing single TFR surgery under WALANT trended toward less time in the OR, had similar surgical times, and spent significantly less time in the recovery room, compared with MAC, thereby resulting in less indirect costs. Each MAC case also had minimum direct excess anesthesia charges of $105, which knowingly underestimates overall charges as it excludes material and fixed costs associated with the delivery of anesthesia. Avoiding sedation for high-volume procedures such as TFR may result in significant systemic savings to payers, and in the future with bundling and episode-based payments can become increasingly important to patients, facilities, and surgeons.
4::Our findings can be used to counsel patients prior to their initial injection and suggest that patients with diabetes can be managed with corticosteroid injection with equal efficacy compared with patients without diabetes.
4::Static and dynamic balance in pwMS appear scarcely correlated, although both worsen as disability increases. This implies that they should be separately assessed using specific tests to have a complete view of postural control performance in MS.
4::Children and adults with celiac disease have similar rates of extraintestinal manifestations. In children short stature, fatigue, and headache were most common, whereas anemia, fatigue, and headache/psychiatric disorders were most common in adults. Children on a strict GFD showed faster and higher rates of symptom resolution as compared to adults. Unresponsive children with short stature must be assessed for comorbidities.
4::FLG and POSTN expression may be downregulated and upregulated, respectively, in the esophageal mucosa of patients with active EoE, and these changes may be restored with treatment in a significant percentage of cases.
4::Alterations in recovery of the probes differ markedly in different epidemiologic contexts in children living in the developing world. The rate of change in the L:M-z ratio was most rapid and consistently disparate from the reference standard in the period between 6 and 9 months of age, suggesting that this is a critical period of physiologic impact of enteropathy in these populations.
4::As compared to mothers who never smoked, early pregnancy smokers had infants with lower cord blood IGF-1 which could prime adverse metabolic outcomes. This provides further reason to support smoking cessation programs in women of reproductive age.
4::Cyclosporine had the highest response rate at 6 months in children with standard-treatment-refractory AIH; however, it also had the highest rate of adverse events. MMF was the second most efficacious option with a low adverse effect rate.
4::NAFLD rather than advanced hepatic fibrosis is independently associated with increased prevalence of chylomicrons+very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) remnants, VLDL, LDL and VLDL+LDL dyslipoproteinemias. ApoB dyslipoproteinemias may contribute to increased CVD risk associated with NAFLD.
4::IV thrombolysis in CRAO seems to be safe and effective within the first 4.5 hours of symptom onset. A clinical decision based on this meta-analysis alone cannot be made due to several limitations. A randomized controlled clinical trial of early IV alteplase administration in CRAO is necessary to provide evidence-based therapeutic guidance.
4::A diagnosis of Sjögren syndrome should be aggressively pursued in patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of autonomic nervous system impairment. Although the spectrum of adrenergic failure is variable, ranging from orthostatic hypotension to an excessive postural tachycardia, most patients do have symptoms of more generalized autonomic failure. Patients who were treated with immune-modulating therapy did improve.
4::The results of this study show that grafting of intact post-extraction sockets using a biphasic in situ hardening bone graft substitute results in an effective preservation of the ridge contour and sufficient new bone formation in the grafted sites, which is imperative for successful implant placement.
4::Dot-like HHs on DWI can be observed without the typical symptoms of TGA. Valsalva maneuver-associated activities could produce asymptomatic hippocampal lesions. The symptoms of TGA may be presented on a spectrum, from no symptoms to mild vegetative symptoms or to the typical symptoms of TGA, depending on individual susceptibility.
4::There is room for improvement in Estonia with medication adherence relating to all three aspects that determine adherence-initiation, implementation, and persistence. This means further efforts are to be made to educate patients and healthcare professionals on realizing the importance of good adherence.
4::Women with HGVIN/cancer should have cervical/vaginal cytology before vulvar surgery. Those with a negative cervical or vaginal cytology result should undergo cytology testing at 1- to 3-year intervals, based on the threshold for CIN 3+ set forth by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology.
4::Among patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 not on dialysis, the bio-intact PTH assay detected significantly lower PTH concentrations compared with intact PTH assay. Additional studies that correlate the diagnosis and management of CKD mineral and bone disorders with bone histomorphometric findings are needed to determine whether bio-intact PTH assay results are better surrogate markers in these early stages of CKD.
4::A high prevalence of NDM-1 genes encoding carbapenem resistance determinants was demonstrated among the K. pneumoniae isolates. Importantly, this is the first report of bla(NDM-1) carriage in a K. pneumoniae ST1383 clone in China and of a MDR CRKP isolate co-harboring bla(NDM-1), bla(KPC-2), bla(CTX-M), bla(SHV), acc(6)-Ib, rmtB, qnrB, and acc(6')-Ib-cr.'
4::Using DTI, widespread occult damage was demonstrated in the NAWM of patients with NMOSD. However, the NAWM was less affected in patients with NMOSD than it was in patients with MS; specifically, the axonal injuries and diffusion abnormalities in the association fibers were more severe in patients with MS than they were in patients with NMOSD.
4::The prevalence and distribution of HR-HPV varied with age and cervical cytology findings. This information would be helpful in the development of cervical cancer prevention policies.
4::The disc-shaped thiolated chitosan-based hydrogels provide a potentially useful platform to deliver ranibizumab and aflibercept for the treatments of ocular diseases such as wet AMD, DME and corneal neovascularization.
4::Because early mortality was significantly higher in patients receiving endovascular treatment for proximal aortic disease, endovascular-based approaches proved to be feasible alternatives to hybrid surgical procedures, especially when they were performed for aneurysms located in the distal aortic arch. Whereas cerebral ischemia accompanies both surgical and endovascular involvement of the supra-aortic vessels, endoleaks and aneurysm growth remain hallmarks of endovascular supra-aortic repair. Because surgical revision had no impact on mortality, complete surgical debranching may become the option of choice for patients with good life expectancy suffering from proximal aortic arch disease, whereas total endovascular procedures could be particularly advantageous in patients with short life expectancy and distal aortic arch disease.
4::Fertility rates in HIV-positive women are stable in the context of generally decreasing fertility. Despite a decrease in HIV-exposed infants, there has been an increase in ART-exposed infants.
4::GS is a rare association of thymoma and immunodeficiency with a poor prognosis. Astute clinical acumen and increased awareness of the clinical and immunological profile of GS are needed to increase early diagnosis, that would benefit improved therapeutic effects.
4::The incidence of obstetric brachial plexus palsy has remained stable in recent years. The percentage of children who present sequelae at six months is significant. Prospective studies are needed to be able to establish the long-term prognostic factors of this pathology.
4::Three minutes of acupressure was effective in decreasing pain intensity in athletes who sustained an acute musculoskeletal sports injury when measured on the VAS, but did not change anxiety levels.
4::The results of this research indicate that the harmful associations between weight discrimination and health-risk behaviors are not limited to behaviors related to eating and physical activity but extend to high-risk behaviors that may contribute to the association between weight discrimination and poor health.
4::A structured PA program reduced the risk of MMD even in older adults with extreme obesity.
4::This study demonstrates an age-dependent decrease in width of the pubic symphysis and left and right SI joints. By contrast, the widths of the triradiate cartilage remain relatively stable until closure. We believe that these age-based normative values will aid in future diagnosis of pathologic diastasis of these areas of the pediatric pelvis.
4::Moderate-to-severe PTH can be expected after TBI in patients with mTIH and post-traumatic seizure. PTH occurs more frequently in patients with mTIH than in those without mTIH.
4::AVP and CIMT can predict CAD burden in a robust way. AVP may emerge as an exquisite bedside tool to predict atherosclerotic burden and guide in implementing preventive therapy for cardiovascular disease.
4::Primary PVS still has a guarded prognosis in the current era despite adoption of the sutureless technique. Postoperative pulmonary hypertension and severity of disease evaluated by a new severity score are independent prognostic factors regardless of surgical technique.
4::The current observations show the value of genetically modifying human bone marrow aspirates upon mechanical stimulation by rAAV sox9 as a promising strategy for future treatments to improve cartilage repair by implantation in lesions where the tissue is submitted to natural mechanical forces.
4::The evaluators were reliable at manipulating the selected software, achieving consistent volume and minimal cross-sectional airway measurements, However, Dolphin Imaging volumetric and minimal cross-sectional airway measurements did not correlate well with the nasopharyngoscopy-supported reference standard for adenoid hypertrophy assessment. Under these study conditions, volume and minimal cross-sectional airway used to assess localized adenoid hypertrophy with cone-beam computed tomography imaging based on automated measurements may not yield high-quality clinically relevant information about upper airway constriction related to adenoid hypertrophy.
4::CCXBB achieved significant horizontal crestal width allowing for staged implant placement in most of the patients. In light of the histological outcomes and implant failures, special attention must be placed to prevent soft tissue dehiscence when CCXBB is used in severe atrophic alveolar crests.
4::In subjects with Class III deformities, more statistically significant correlations were found between inclination and thickness in the mandibular teeth, whereas in subjects with normal occlusion, few statistically significant correlations were found between these 2 variables.
4::The most critical period was the first 2 months of dialysis initiation. Patients who were older, female, diabetic and hypertensive had higher risk of early mortality. Our analysis highlighted that the transitional period from sever CKD stages to dialysis initiation, when optimal supportive care should be adopted, was crucial for patients survival.'
4::Elevation of a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap alone (ie, without injury to bone) decreases the amount and density of medullary bone surrounding the tooth and accelerates tooth movement. Due to its limited effects, elevation of a flap alone to increase tooth movements may not be justified.
4::The prevalence of malocclusion was higher among children with ASD. Posterior crossbite, increased overjet, and severe maxillary crowding were the most common malocclusion traits in these children.
4::Maternal BMI and glycemia have metabolic signatures that are both shared and unique to each phenotype. These signatures largely remain consistent across different ancestry groups and may contribute to the common and independent effects of these two phenotypes on adverse pregnancy outcomes.
4::In the daily routine, liver enzyme values do not give an accurate picture of liver damage associated with ulcerative colitis. With the help of various specific parameters determined by us, we can estimate the background processes of the gut-liver axis alterations. The decrease in bile acid levels can be a predictive factor in ulcerative colitis. Our work highlights the need of non-invasive screening for liver diseases in inflammatory bowel disease. Orv Hetil. 2017; 158(26): 1014-1021.
4::A robust volume-outcome relationship was observed for deceased donor kidney transplantation, and low-volume centers are frequently in close proximity to higher volume centers. Increased regionalization could improve outcomes, but should be considered carefully in light of the potential negative impact on transplant volume and access to care.
4::Fibrinolysis shutdown is common postinjury and predicts poor outcomes. Severe TBI is associated with sustained shutdown. Empiric antifibrinolytics for children should be questioned; thromboelastography-directed selective use should be considered for documented HF.
4::Moral distress, resulting from therapeutic obstinacy and the provision of futile care, is an important issue among critical care providers team, and it was significantly associated with severe burnout.'
4::CRS accurately predicted HCC recurrence beyond MC in this international validation. Although the risk of recurrence beyond MC decreased over time, it never reached zero.
4::Our proposed method clearly reduced inter-scanner variability in SUVs. A digital phantom developed by QIBA would be useful for harmonizing SUVs in multicenter trials using SPECT/CT.
4::There was a significant relationship between the number and patient-reported severity of endometriosis symptoms experienced and hours of employment and household productivity lost because of presenteeism and absenteeism. Study findings indicate a need for guidance strategies to help women and employers manage endometriosis so as to reduce productivity loss.
4::Renal lymphangiectasia can be diagnosed with CT scan and confirmed by laboratory tests. As it may be confused with other cystic lesions of kidney; proper diagnosis and exclusion of other differentials can be effectively offered by CT scan IVP, which can avoid unnecessary invasive treatment options.
4::Commercially insured and Medicaid-insured individuals aged < 21 years with DS experience a greater number and prevalence of concomitant diagnoses compared with non-DS individuals. Awareness of these common diagnoses could help facilitate the optimal care of these individuals by the pediatric health care community.
4::SCAD has a high prevalence in young female AMI population in Jiangsu, China. Discriminating the cause of AMI in young female population is very important.
4::Adult dual eligible patients aged less than 65 years with behavioral health illness in the Medicaid fee-for-service plan had significantly higher rates of hospital admission and ED use compared with dual eligible patients without behavioral health illness at the largest urban safety net medical center in New England. Safety net hospitals care for a large proportion of dual eligible patients with behavioral health illness. Further research is needed to elucidate the systems-related and patient-centered factors contributing to the utilization behaviors of this patient population.
4::The SAPS 3 score system exhibited satisfactory performance even superior to APACHE II in discrimination. In predicting hospital mortality, SAPS 3 did not exhibit good calibration and overestimated hospital mortality, which demonstrated that SAPS 3 needs improvement in the future.
4::In this large, real-world population, stable patients with HIV who switched from their first-line ART regimens had significantly higher health care costs than those who did not change therapies, suggesting that ART regimen changes may be costly and should be undertaken only when clinically warranted.
4::Cervical spinal tumors, curettage, and nonintact tumors were risk factors for local recurrence. Intralesional curettage and malignancy were the most important significant factors for local recurrence and death, respectively.
4::In all patients with RH, the catheter-based RDN is not more effective in lowering ambulatory or office BP than an optimized antihypertensive drug treatment at 6 and 12 months. However, among RH patients with higher baseline SBP, RDN might be more effective in reducing SBP.
4::The combined evaluation of multiple spectral regions can increase the diagnostic performance of (1)H-MRS and potentially reduce false positive findings.
4::Desert dust episode days are associated with higher respiratory emergency room visits and hospital admissions. This effect is insufficiently explained by increased PM10 levels.
4::A decrease of the craniocaudal gradient of MPCR was observed in COPD patients. The craniocaudal gradient was lower in severe COPD patients than in mild COPD patients.
4::The results from our ovarian cancer study suggest that adjunctive HIPEC proffers a significant progression-free survival advantage and a decreased risk for disease progression. There was, however, no overall survival advantage discerned by the HIPEC group. We also recognize that HIPEC remains controversial, and thus randomized studies evaluating HIPEC compared to standard chemotherapy in the management of ovarian cancer are warranted.
4::When women present for FP on CHC, AFC may be suppressed. A CHC break of several months is associated with an increase in AFC and a potential improvement in overall egg yield.
4::Although several instruments have been used to assess the impact of COPD on caregivers, an increased understanding of their properties is needed before their widespread implementation.
4::This analysis demonstrated that the SGRQ has acceptable psychometric properties in patients with severe asthma, exceeding the thresholds for adequate reliability, validity and responsiveness. The SGRQ appears to be a good instrument for identifying response to therapy in patients with severe asthma.
4::Treat-and-extend intravitreal therapy with aflibercept may be effective for improving BCVA and exudative change in eyes with PCV. The regression of polypoidal lesions after the loading phase and thicker choroid at baseline might lead to fewer total number of intravitreal injections of aflibercept.
4::These novel findings indicated that blockade of MMP-2 and -9 could inhibit lymphangiogenesis. Further investigation of this factor may provide novel therapies for transplant rejection and other lymphatic disorders.
4::Lung ultrasound had high diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of radiographically-confirmed pneumonia. Added benefits of lung ultrasound include rapid testing and high inter-rater agreement. Lung ultrasound may serve as an alternative tool for the diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia.
4::We did not find evidence for an increased likelihood of LTSA among multiple job holders. Future research should study the likelihood of LTSA among subgroups of multiple job holders, e.g. those working long hours.
4::Physical concerns scores in COPD patients are partially explained by avoidance in this group. The results of the study provide evidence for the importance of evaluating avoidance in COPD patients and implicate targeting this behavior in therapeutic interventions.
4::Elevated serum D-dimer is associated with the risk of developing AE. Serum D-dimer may be used as a prognostic marker to predict AE or recognize preclinical AE.
4::This single-institution retrospective study indicates that in a heavily pretreated population approximately 4% of mCRC tumors display a potential actionable molecular context suitable for therapeutic intervention. Application of molecular selection is challenging but improves clinical outcome even in later lines of treatment.
4::These results provide more compelling evidence for the role of zolpidem or zopiclone in the occurrence of RTCs among older adults, not only in frequent users, but also at the beginning of treatment.
4::This paper provides evidence for the cumulative health impact of stressful life events, both those that are perpetrated against an individual (violence) and those undertaken with a degree of personal agency (caregiving). The findings underscore the need to understand the drivers of poor health, for clinicians to ask about life circumstances of patients experiencing poor health, and for the provision of referral pathways for complex cases.
4::This newly described deletion is likely to lead to loss of function in the functionally important GTPase domain encoded by exons 9-16, and the heterozygosity suggested that haploinsufficiency caused the phenotypes. The deletion may be associated with mild DOA phenotypes ranging from asymptomatic to moderately decreased visual acuity.
4::These data can be used by long-term care clinicians to assist in planning interventions and care approaches which promote physical activity and good sleep practices, and are individualized to physical and cognitive capabilities. Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12614000508673).
4::We present evidence suggesting that the association between body size perception and poor mental health in adolescence is changing over time. This may play a role in the recently observed worsening of mental well-being in Scottish adolescents.
4::Disparities between UB-SDM educational efforts and entrenched dental practice cultures must be addressed in order for our graduates to fully embrace BP and CBS assessments in practice.
4::Nurses in inpatient pediatric care settings that care for fewer patients each and practice in a professionally supportive work environment miss care less often, increasing quality of patient care.
4::Arthroscopic arthrolysis is an effective treatment option for patients with restriction in elbow motion reasoned by post-traumatic or degenerative changes. Both groups showed a significant improvement of ROM and comparable outcome scores.
4::Patients with IPVD appear to have a substantial risk of developing oxygenation impairment over time and progress to HPS. In our cohort, survival in patients with HPS and isolated IPVD is not different when compared to those without IPVDs.
4::PSC thickness did not significantly evolve with age in young males (≤45 years) but it decreased from age 45 years onwards. On the other hand, PCS thickness increased with age in women until the age of 45 years and it did not significantly change in older females.
4::This study found that postoperative SIR was overall less pronounced in RALC, thus depicting reduced tissue trauma. No major clinical differences between RALC-IUD and -EUD were found.
4::Higher proportion of NK cells expressing inhibitory CD158b and CD158e receptors is associated with significant liver injury.
4::No clinical evidence was found to indicate that African Americans should be more often deemed ineligible for HCV treatment than other racial groups. Diabetes and renal disease do not fully explain the HCV treatment ineligibility racial disparity, because HCV patients with these conditions are priority patients for HCV treatment because of their greater risk for cirrhosis, steatosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The findings suggest that an underlying contributor to the HCV treatment eligibility disparity disfavoring African Americans could be racial discrimination.
4::Delirium occurs in at least 1 in 5 patients after transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement. Delirium is less likely to develop in the transcatheter group but is associated with higher mortality in both groups.
4::The data collected through this study demonstrate a significant increase in systemic ADMA levels following major laparoscopic colorectal surgery.
4::Focusing interventions on workload burden and factors influencing bundle difficulty may facilitate ABCDE bundle adherence.
4::Uninterrupted actigraphy is feasible and generally well tolerated by MICU patients and may be considered for future large-scale studies. Wrist and ankle actigraphy measurements of sleep and activity in this setting agree poorly and cannot be used interchangeably.
4::Physical health was more severely impaired than was mental health, and both types improved over time. The EuroQol-5-Dimensions-5-Levels instrument was useful for detecting neurological problems of the lower extremities early and may qualify as a core outcome measure for patients treated with ECMO.
4::The results suggest a promising electrophysiological approach to identifying individuals with convergence insufficiency and a history of concussion.
4::Mini-laparoscopy can be safely and effectively used to perform benign adnexal mass surgery.
4::In T2DM patients with impaired liver function, canagliflozin may improve liver function, reduce HbA1c and body weight, and be well tolerated.
4::This study analysed the specific attitudes, experience and education on pharmacogenomics of future users. There was a general positive attitude and interest towards pharmacogenomic testing. However, the grade of own experience, and knowledge about application and interpretation of pharmacogenomics caused uncertainty. Thus, education and training programmes may be helpful for implementation of pharmacogenomics at a homogenous level within Europe.
4::Prolactinomas have predominantly inferior growth compared to nonfunctioning adenomas and are less likely to cause vision changes.
4::Defining the precise risk of LNM could lead to proper selection of patients in whom any lymph nodal procedure, including SLN, could be avoided.
4::The most significant variables in the univariate analysis were connected by a common factor, potentially related to the overall development stage of the country.
4::Although few ESBL-PE carriers developed ESBL-PE pneumonia overall, a high proportion of pneumonia were caused by ESBL-PE in carriers developing ICUAP. ESBL-PE pneumonia was not an independent predictor of mortality. As pneumonia caused by CRB is increasing, knowledge of factors associated with ESBL-PE or CRB pneumonia may help empiric therapy of pneumonia among ESBL-PE carriers.
4::The linkage of trial registries to their corresponding publications continues to require extensive manual processes. We did not find that the use of automatic linkage has increased over time. Further investigation is needed to inform approaches that will ensure publications are properly linked to trial registrations, thus enabling efficient monitoring of trial reporting.
4::Proportional ventilation during exercise results in higher work efficiency and less increase in VO2 compared to ventilation with PSV. These preliminary findings suggest that proportional ventilation could enhance the training effect and facilitate rehabilitation.
4::Alcohol-dependent subjects present an inflammatory condition that is not dependent on alcohol consumption. An understanding of the changes in concentration of the various proteins considered here would provide insight into the physiology of withdrawal or dependence.
4::RBC transfusion is commonly used in the early resuscitation of septic patients with hematological malignancies. Although it was preferentially provided to the most severe patients, we found it possibly associated with an increased risk of death.
4::Apoptosis was verified but no tumor-suppressing effects could be observed for iv and ip treatment with both agents in contrast to in vitro studies in our model. Establishing a successful ip treatment model for emotion and BTB14331 requires further studies.
4::The rate of periocular allergic reactions to NPD ophthalmic ointment is significantly lower than reported in the literature for other topical preparations of neomycin and polymyxin B. The low rate of allergy in this study suggests that NPD ophthalmic ointment can safely be applied to the periocular skin with a very minimal risk of inciting an allergic reaction.
4::Some quality measures assessing care for substance use disorders were significantly associated with patient perceptions of care. Results provide additional support for these quality measures and suggest that patient perceptions of care are an important outcome in assessing care.
4::Although the prevalence of psychotherapy provided immediately before and after initiation of psychotropic polypharmacy has slightly increased in the past decade, it remains low among Medicaid-insured patients, particularly among adults. Reasons for variation in psychotherapy utilization across states deserve further exploration.
4::Rectal STI are independently associated with HIV acquisition. These findings support the hypothesis that rectal STI play a biologically mediated causal role in HIV acquisition and support screening/treatment of STI for HIV prevention.
4::Identifiable digital correlates may serve as indicators of increased risk of violence.
4::Estimated gonorrhea rate among MSM increased in a network of 6 geographically diverse US jurisdictions. Estimating the size of this population, determining MSM among reported cases and estimating rates are essential first steps for better understanding the changing epidemiology of gonorrhea.
4::Our results suggest that differences in emotional response may be negligible when PD patients and healthy controls are presented with dynamic, ecologically valid emotional stimuli. Given the limited data available on pupil response in PD, this study provides new evidence to suggest that the PD-related deficits in emotion processing reported in the literature may not translate to real-world differences in physiological or subjective emotion processing in early-stage PD patients.
4::These findings illustrate differences between dual-condom LARC and LARC-only college users. It is likely that relationship status and number of partners influences perceived risk for STIs and decision making for dual use among this population.
4::The prevalence of HPV and p16 positivity was relatively low and p16 status was a poor surrogate marker for HPV status. The results showed the importance of p16 expression in prognosticating mobile tongue cancer.
4::Oral HPV DNA is uncommon in young women in Latin America, and often appears to clear within a few years at similar rates to cervical HPV.
4::Relapse is a frequent problem in PD, and long-term treatment does not protect these patients in the long run. Treatment with clonazepam predicts lower relapse when compared with paroxetine.
4::The measured velocities of graft hepatic vessels tended to increase after administration of USCA, but without statistical significance. The comparison of serial Doppler parameters with or without injection of USCA is valid during Doppler surveillance in recipients of LT.
4::We observed response and resistance to alkylating agents in MGMT-deficient and MGMT-intact tumors. O-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase status should not guide alkylating agent therapy in WD panNETs.
4::We demonstrate poor concordance between sPFT and sEUS suggesting that a combined shortened functional and structural test using a single instrument may not be a feasible test for diagnosis of suspected CP when a cutoff of 80 mEq/L is used.
4::In this study, targeting young adults (≤50 years), the bowel preparation achieved by patients using the smartphone app showed significantly better quality than that of the control group.
4::Exosomal markers (CD63 and CD9) expression assessment using immunohistochemistry is feasible in RPS. The expression of CD63 and CD9 is higher in PTs and malignant PTs compared with their ANTs.
4::The prevalence of PCLs detected by magnetic resonance imaging in a preventive medical examination was 13.7%. Pancreatic cystic lesions were significantly associated with DM and obesity.
4::This study provides further evidence confirming the worldwide overuse of prescription medications for BPD and shows that there has been a shift in the prescription pattern in the last 15 years. These results suggest that real clinical practice only partially adheres to clinical treatment guidelines.
4::The CHX substantivity on human dentine is lowest when using reciprocating compared to manual and rotary instrumentation.
4::Frey syndrome is common after parotidectomy. Tumor size is the only statistically significant predictor of its development. Routine preventive interventions, for example, use of acellular dermal matrix, dermofat graft or muscle flaps to prevent Frey syndrome, should be considered for high risk patients.
4::Betadine 5% application significantly decreases epithelial integrity of the cornea, decreases functional vision, and increases subjective complaints.
4::Liquid-base exfoliative cytology can be used to detect preclinical alterations in the oral mucosa. Patients treated with mechanical ventilation are vulnerable to infections, and oral care may be valuable in their prognosis.
4::Results indicate that female sex workers do not have an increased risk for E. histolytica infection in Durango City, Mexico. Further studies to determine the risk of infection with E. histolytica by sexual contact should be conducted.
4::Eight-weeks of FES can benefit the gait pattern of people with MS under non-fatigued and fatigued conditions. Implications for rehabilitation In some people with MS prolonged use of FES may be necessary before observing positive orthotic effects. Improvements in the neuromuscular control of the more affected lower limb may develop with prolonged use of FES in people with MS. Only some therapeutic benefits of FES are maintained during fatigued walking in people with MS. FES may be considered as a gait retraining device as well as an orthotic intervention for people with MS.
4::Overall patient satisfaction was strongly associated with perceptions of good communication and transfer of information. Confidence and trust in the clinical team is an important determinant of patient experience. Improving the ward environment by reducing noise at night may also improve the overall experience and satisfaction in emergency surgery.
4::Our work shows that RanBPM, together with the CTLH complex, associates with HDAC6 and restricts cell migration through inhibition of HDAC6 activity. This study uncovers a novel function for the CTLH complex and suggests that it could have a tumour suppressive role in restricting HDAC6 oncogenic properties.
4::MIS techniques successfully stabilized ASD patients with Group 0 and + deformities and improved HRQoL. This study suggests that severe sagittal imbalance is not adequately treated with MIS approaches.
4::This study found consistent and robust evidence for an increase in family planning methods over program duration as well as intensity of social franchise programs.
4::In 2011, the age-standardized mortality rate for cancer exceeded that of CVD in both sexes in the UK. These changing trends in mortality may support evidence for changes in policy and resource allocation in the UK.
4::BSYSC could attenuate axonal injury and promote repair of axonal damage in EAE mice in part through the down-regulation of NogoA/NgR and RhoA/ROCK signaling pathways.
4::In Finland, male gender is significantly associated with both weekly gambling expenditure and monthly gambling expenditure related to net income. People in Finland with lower incomes contribute proportionally more of their income to gambling compared with middle and high-income groups.
4::A choriovitelline placenta is not formed early in gestation nor is it present at term. Early in development invasive trophoblast spreads laterally to form a trophoblastic plate. We found evidence to support the idea that the colugo placenta is intermediate between the labyrinthine placenta of rodents and the trabecular type of Neotropical primates.
4::Housing First programs in Canada are equally effective in people with and without comorbid substance use disorder (SUD). Overall, the intervention appears to be able to engage people with SUD and is reasonably successful at housing them, without housing being contingent on abstinence or treatment.
4::IVL with IVCE or ICE is a rare disease with nonspecific manifestations. Surgery is the primary treatment. The postoperative recurrence rate is high, and postoperative antiestrogen hormone therapy is not significantly correlated with recurrence.
4::Despite abundant total MPs and MPs in immune complexes, β2 GPI-positive MPs were depleted in SLE patients and especially low among aPL/anti-β2 GPI positive patients. We suggest that anti-β2 GPI antibodies bind to β2 GPI-PS complexes expressed on MPs. Consequent loss of β2 GPI-PS expression on MPs may impair scavenging and contribute to accumulation of circulating PS negative MPs, a possible source of auto-antigens. Autoantibodies delaying MP clearance may thus constitute an important mechanism underlying autoimmunity. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
4::Use of the AGREE II Instrument during guideline development did not have as great an effect on guideline quality as might be expected. There is considerable room for improvement in acne treatment guidelines in order to satisfy the IOM trustworthiness criteria and avoid bias. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
4::Double prepuncture is a useful technical adjunct both for simultaneous endovenous ablation of multiple adjacent incompetent veins and when catheter passage is impeded. This technique aids in efficient and successful application of endovenous ablation to complex venous anatomy.
4::Rivaroxaban (10 mg/d) for 5 to 10 days seems to be an efficacious and safe alternative for EHIT prophylaxis in EVLA with or without phlebectomy.
4::Ethanol oxidative metabolism plays a pivotal role in the ethanol-evoked LV oxidative stress and dysfunction in proestrous rats. Notably, catalase inhibition (3-AT) caused cardiac oxidative stress and hypotension. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
4::Ulcers recurred in a minority of CEAP clinical C5 and C6 patients after EVTA of the saphenous veins. Ulcer recurrence was less frequent in patients without concomitant deep venous reflux and in those treated with phlebectomy of varicose veins at the time of EVTA. We suggest consideration of phlebectomy at the time of EVTA for patients with C5 and C6 venous insufficiency, particularly in those with isolated superficial venous insufficiency.
4::Our results demonstrate that EAPPI MS can be regarded as a supplementary ambient method for the fast and comprehensive analysis of TCHMs, which is important for the quality control and safety assurance of TCHMs.
4::In patients with central vein occlusion and exhaustion of conventional insertion sites, a tunneled central venous catheter can be safely placed through SVC puncture by the transcutaneous route.
4::Except for a significant decrease in the pathogenic burden of A. actinomycetemcomitans, coadjuvant PDT resulted in no additional improvement compared with SRP alone in patients diagnosed with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
4::Our results provide evidence for MCP-1 involvement in the development of PVVs and indicate that inflammation could be implicated in the pathogenesis of this condition.
4::Conservative treatment along with oral anticoagulation may be reasonable for some AVAs, but to date, there is no clear guideline or evidence-based threshold for surgical or interventional therapy. In review of the existing data and from our clinical and scientific knowledge, interventional or surgical treatment should strongly be considered in cases with clinical symptoms, pulmonary embolism or pulmonary arterial hypertension, thrombus formation within the AVA in patients with oral anticoagulation or for patients with a contraindication to oral anticoagulants, considerable increase in diameter or compression of adjacent structures, saccular AVA, or an underlying connective tissue disease. The most common procedure is surgical ligation of the AVA, although endovascular occlusion of the aneurysms is becoming more frequent.
4::The preparation techniques resulted in the same level of accumulated hard-tissue debris. Compared to the other tested systems, BioRace was associated with more untouched canal areas, and Reciproc produced the greatest amount of removed dentine. Although it touched more of the root canal walls, the SAF system removed less dentine, whereas TRUShape had intermediate results for these same parameters. None of the systems tested were able to provide optimal shaping ability in oval-shaped canals. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
4::T2 dark strands and fascial tail are characteristic features of awdt, whereas other subjective/qualitative findings are not useful. Quantitative findings such as ADC measurements and DCE curve analysis may have additional value to differentiate awdt from ndawt, but will require further analysis.
4::The frequency with which the LN is excised during LC by the one surgeon is independent of the majority of clinical and surgical factors and may represent a surrogate marker of surgical technique. Whether this is related to the rate of bile duct injury remains to be determined.
4::(90)Y radioembolization is a promising alternative therapy for the treatment of unresectable liver metastases of melanoma, with encouraging effects on disease control and survival. Some complications can occur, and side effects are frequent but mild.
4::This survey indicates that in third-level headache centers in Italy OBT-A is used in good compliance with current recommendations. There is agreement about the definition of response as a reduction in headache days by 30% to 50%. Additional effort is required to define response to OBT-A and to establish optimal treatment duration.
4::This study in a regional hospital setting found a low evaluation rate for osteoporosis among patients presenting with a rib fracture. This study suggests that increased emphasis or education for osteoporosis evaluation may be necessary for physicians who are often referred to for care of rib fractures.
4::Detection of mild COPD without substantial overdiagnosis was not feasible on chest radiographs in our cohort.
4::The pvmdr1 gene might have diversified recently at regional level. In the absence of significant natural, genetic drift might have caused differential pvmdr1 haplotype frequencies at different geographic sites in Mesoamerica. A very recent expansion of divergent pvmdr1 haplotypes in NIC-NE/NIC-NW produced high differentiation between these and parasites from other sites including SMX. These data are useful to set a baseline for epidemiological surveillance.
4::Inflammatory signals are detected, amplified, and propagated through the CNS via a sequential and reverberating signaling cascade involving communication between brain endothelial cells and glia. We propose that the brains innate immune response differs depending upon which side of the blood-brain barrier the inflammatory stimulus arises, thus allowing the brain to respond differently to central vs. peripheral inflammatory insults.'
4::Detection of HR-HPV type-specific antibodies highly correlated with HPV-attributable OPSCC and was associated with better survival. HR-HPV antibodies are promising diagnostic, prognostic and potentially screening markers in HR-HPV-attributable OPSCC.
4::Frailty is a strong and independent prognostic factor for midterm all-cause mortality in elderly patients presenting with ACS.
4::In veteran patients hospitalized for HF, pharmacist-managed HF bridge clinic significantly reduced the time to initial follow-up compared with usual care. Improved short-term outcomes and trend toward improvement of longer-term outcomes in bridge clinic patients was shown.
4::Agreement between gastroenterologists and IBD patients regarding the presence of clinically significant anxiety or depression was low, with no further action taken after consultation for 50% of patients who were identified by gastroenterologists as being anxious or depressed. This study highlights the need for educating gastroenterologists to improve their ability to identify IBD patient distress.
4::Odds of stroke after cardiac surgery are increased in patients with a low minimum PaO2 within 24 hours of surgery. Results should be validated in an independent cohort. Further characterizing the underlying etiology of hypoxic episodes will be important to improve patient outcomes.
4::The implementation of the ACA in California has helped reduce some of the disparities in health care access, utilization, and medication use between non-Latino whites and Mexican-heritage Latinos with hypertension. However, sustained progress is threatened by looming repeals of ACA provisions.
4::Experiences in coordinating care for women Veterans with gynecologic malignancies receiving concurrent VA and community cancer care reveal challenges inherent in delivering care across health care systems, as well as potential approaches for addressing them.
4::OJ reduces inflammatory response, and this probably explains its positive impact on the prostatitis associated inflammation.
4::(1) A somewhat below-norm level of respiratory parameters among preterm-born girls entering pubescence may attest to continued negative impact on their respiratory system. (2) A significant improvement in their spirometric results 1 year later may indicate that pubescence helps compensate for the earlier negative effect of preterm birth. (3) No significant differences were seen in lung function in preterm-born adults as compared with a reference group of adults, although the preterm-born group did exhibit lower values of all parameters studied and more frequent obstructive disorders.
4::Firefighters perceive cancer risks as the result of performing essential job tasks and from indirect job factors related to being a firefighter. The two categories of cancer risks suggest different points of entry for intervention.
4::The MSCRQ appears to be a reliable and valid measure of metacognitions about self-critical rumination whilst the MCQ-30 is a better predictor of general emotional distress.
4::In patients with narcolepsy, JZP-110 significantly improved the ability to stay awake compared with placebo, with large effect sizes using both the 40-min and 20-min censored MWT data.
4::This study shows that sleep quality and fragmentation are closely related to atrophic changes in hippocampus and putamen. In addition, atrophic changes in global subcortical structures are associated with impaired cognitive function in patients with chronic insomnia.
4::Conventional and low-dose hydro-CT may be a valuable non-invasive diagnostic method in the diagnosis of gastric tumors for patients who have contraindications to endoscopy or who are unable to undergo gastric biopsy.
4::The partial strong invariance of the ISI supports that it is a valid outcome measure for CBT-I. In contrast, various changes in the factor model of the PSQI indicate that it may not be an appropriate outcome measure for CBT-I. Some possible causes for the changes of the constructs of the PSQI following CBT-I are discussed.
4::This study demonstrates that there are distinct sleep quality subtypes in children that could have implications for HRQOL. These findings may inform future strategies to promote improved sleep and HRQOL in children.
4::The multi-slice CTA has high diagnostic value for lower gastrointestinal bleeding.
4::Afterload changes should be taken into account in the evaluation of RVFWS during PAH follow-up, with the relationship to PASP likely to be linear.
4::Multimodal interventions can improve long-term perception of recovery, as well as balance, gait, grip strength, and working memory in a mixed population of individuals in late phase after stroke.
4::Low-dose alteplase may improve outcomes in thrombolysis-treated acute ischemic stroke patients on prior APT, but this requires further evaluation in a randomized controlled trial.
4::Antibiotic prophylaxis in comatose patients reduced the incidence of EO-VAP and decreased the ICU stay slightly. Future trials are needed to confirm these results.
4::Our study has demonstrated that rFOV-DTI could provide information of optic nerve damage in chronic LHON, and can serve as technique for detecting and evaluating pathological changes in the optic nerve in LHON.
4::The protocol of 90kVp-IR3 and 100kVp-IR1 yielded similar calcium detectability, Agatston score and image quality as the reference protocol, with dose reduction up to 60.6%.
4::Our study validated Skindex symptom, Skindex function and SCI social subscales for QoL measurement during treatment with topical 5-FU. The study could not provide evidence for construct validity of the other subscales. Skindex was more responsive than SCI in the context of 5-FU treatment.
4::CF complicated with ABPA shows higher attenuation bronchoceles on CT scans of the chest. Systematic density measurements of bronchoceles could help to raise the difficult diagnosis of ABPA in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis. Larger series could confirm a threshold in HU which could become a new imaging criterion for the diagnosis of ABPA.
4::The study indicates that 3D MR bone models may offer a feasible alternative to traditional CT-based modeling. A single radiological examination using the MR imaging would allow simultaneous assessment of both bones and soft-tissues, providing anatomically comprehensive joint models for clinical evaluation, without the ionizing radiation of CT imaging.
4::Structural and functional damage of the PFC and temporal lobe are associated with subtle cognitive decline in PD, while functional enhancement of the MTL and POJ is involved in normal cognitive function of PD. In addition, the combined application of rs-fMRI and VBM analysis might become an effective means to investigate cognitive impairment-related GM abnormalities in PD-MCI patients prior to development of dementia.
4::We described the largest cohort of severe systemic capillary-leak syndrome flares requiring ICU admission. High-volume fluid therapy was independently associated with poorer outcomes. IV immunoglobulin use was not associated with improved survival; hence, their use should be considered prudently and needs further evaluation in future studies.
4::The visual guides that we have generated for scoring atherosclerotic luminal narrowing of coronary arteries should be helpful for a broad group of pathologists, from beginning pathology residents to experienced cardiovascular pathologists.
4::A CT protocol that incorporates low kV settings with a personalized (BMI-adjusted) reference amplitude for tube current modulation and iterative reconstruction enables very low radiation exposure CTA, while maintaining good image quality and high diagnostic accuracy in the assessment of PAD.
4::Curcumin could accelerate injured sciatic nerve repair in rats through reducing SCs apoptosis and promoting myelinization.
4::There are no substantial clinically relevant differences in the risk of cardiovascular events, including hospitalization for heart failure, between 3 of the DPP-4 inhibitors and placebo.
4::Quantitative assessment by MTV rather than by SUVmax and TLG on PET/CT may be helpful for stratifying patients who present with peritoneal carcinomatosis from EOC, in order to implement the appropriate therapeutic regimen.
4::Nearly one in five patients developed HM after CDP within 6 months with a highly consistent pattern. A thorough preoperative assessment, combining CT scan and MRI with a delay of less than three weeks before surgery, appears essential. A routine systematic postoperative CT scan at 8 weeks is also required prior to initiating adjuvant chemotherapy. The type of surgical intervention does not seem to be a risk factor, although the risk of HM occurrence appears to be related to the lymphovascular invasion of the tumor and maybe its degree of differentiation, elements not assessable by imaging.
4::While inulin, and perhaps other fermentable fibers, can ameliorate low-grade inflammation and associated metabolic disease, it also has the potential to exacerbate disease severity in response to inducers of acute colitis.
